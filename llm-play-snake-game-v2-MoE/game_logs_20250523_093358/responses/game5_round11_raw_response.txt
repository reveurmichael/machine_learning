========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the current game state to plan a safe path for the snake from (7, 7) to (9, 6).

First, let's determine the required movements based on the coordinates:

- From (7, 7) to (9, 6):
  - We need to move RIGHT twice: 9 - 7 = 2
  - We need to move DOWN once: 7 - 6 = 1

Given that the current direction is "DOWN", our first move cannot be "UP". Let's construct a sequence of moves:

### Step-by-step Plan:
1. Move RIGHT (to (8, 7))
2. Move RIGHT again (to (9, 7))
3. Move DOWN to reach the apple at (9, 6)

This path satisfies all constraints: it doesn't reverse direction immediately, avoids body collisions (since body is empty), and leads directly to the apple.

Let's format this as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move RIGHT twice then DOWN once to reach the apple safely."
}
```

### Final Output:
```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move RIGHT twice then DOWN once to reach the apple safely."
}
```
```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move RIGHT twice then DOWN once to reach the apple safely."
}
```
