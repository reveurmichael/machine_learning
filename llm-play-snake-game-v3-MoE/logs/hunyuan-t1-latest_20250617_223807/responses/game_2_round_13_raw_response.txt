========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move down 4 times (from y=4 to y=0) and right 3 times (from x=0 to x=3). Each downward move avoids the body (initially along y=4-5) and stays in bounds. Right moves after reaching y=0 avoid the tail and body segments. After eating the apple, the snake can move up or right, ensuring a legal next move."
