Let me analyze the current game state and plan a safe path to the apple at (8, 2):

Current situation:
- Snake head at (5, 5) with no current direction (can choose any initial move)
- Apple at (8, 2)
- No snake body segments visible (just starting)
- Board is 10x10 grid

Path planning:
To reach (8, 2) from (5, 5), we need to:
1. Move left (decrease column) by 3 (from 5 to 2)
2. Move down (increase row) by 3 (from 5 to 8)

Safe sequence (avoiding walls and potential future collisions):
Since there's no body yet, we can choose any initial direction. The most efficient path would be to first move left, then down.

Here's the move sequence:

1. LEFT (to (5,4))
2. LEFT (to (5,3))
3. LEFT (to (5,2)) - now aligned with apple column
4. DOWN (to (6,2))
5. DOWN (to (7,2))
6. DOWN (to (8,2)) - reaches apple

This is a safe 6-move sequence that will get the snake to the apple without any risk of collision (since there's no body segments yet). After the first move, we can't reverse direction (no RIGHT moves allowed after starting LEFT), but this path doesn't require any reversals.

Alternative safe sequences would involve moving down first then left, but that would take more moves (minimum 8 moves). The sequence above is the most efficient direct path.
