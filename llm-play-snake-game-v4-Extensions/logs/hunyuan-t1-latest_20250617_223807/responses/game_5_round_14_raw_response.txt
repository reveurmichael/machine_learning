{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (2,5) with direction DOWN. To reach the apple at (8,6), the optimal path involves moving right to align with the apple's x-coordinate and up to match its y-coordinate. The first move RIGHT avoids body collisions and progresses toward the apple. Subsequent RIGHT moves maintain progress toward x=8, and an UP move adjusts the y-coordinate to 6. All intermediate positions are checked for collisions with the body (which is shifting safely) and remain within grid bounds. The final move to (8,6) reaches the apple without self-collision, and the path ensures no immediate trapping after eating."
