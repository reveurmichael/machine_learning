that the defender is going to read so if

196
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,560
that the defender is going to read so if
 

197
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,660
that the defender is going to read so if
I'm getting ready to cross over and I

198
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:42,670
I'm getting ready to cross over and I
 

199
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,220
I'm getting ready to cross over and I
want to cross over to the middle if I

200
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,230
want to cross over to the middle if I
 

201
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,869
want to cross over to the middle if I
set up a crossover and I'm looking right

202
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:45,879
set up a crossover and I'm looking right
 

203
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,300
set up a crossover and I'm looking right
there the defender knows exactly where

204
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,310
there the defender knows exactly where
 

205
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,920
there the defender knows exactly where
I'm going I'm staring right at my path

207
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,319
I'm going I'm staring right at my path
right but if I go to hit a crossover and

208
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:52,329
right but if I go to hit a crossover and
 

209
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,940
right but if I go to hit a crossover and
I throw my eyes this direction

210
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:53,950
I throw my eyes this direction
 

211
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,740
I throw my eyes this direction
what's the defender gonna do it looks

212
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:55,750
what's the defender gonna do it looks
 

213
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,670
what's the defender gonna do it looks
like I'm going this way they're gonna

like I'm going this way they're gonna
 

215
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,559
like I'm going this way they're gonna
slide to cut me off that way when I whip

216
00:02:58,559 --> 00:02:58,569
slide to cut me off that way when I whip
 

217
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,809
slide to cut me off that way when I whip
it I'm going by them so think about you

218
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:00,819
it I'm going by them so think about you
 

219
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,220
it I'm going by them so think about you
know a crossover and to really have a

220
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,230
know a crossover and to really have a
 

221
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,780
know a crossover and to really have a
shifty crossover it's more like playing

222
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:03,790
shifty crossover it's more like playing
 

223
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,699
shifty crossover it's more like playing
chess than it is playing checkers you've

224
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:05,709
chess than it is playing checkers you've
 

225
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,800
chess than it is playing checkers you've
got to set it up one move ahead so if

226
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:07,810
got to set it up one move ahead so if
 

227
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,759
got to set it up one move ahead so if
I'm getting ready and I know I'm gonna

228
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:08,769
I'm getting ready and I know I'm gonna
 

229
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,410
I'm getting ready and I know I'm gonna
okay I'm gonna quit crossover push the

230
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:10,420
okay I'm gonna quit crossover push the
 

231
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,180
okay I'm gonna quit crossover push the
outside I might throw my eyes to the

232
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,190
outside I might throw my eyes to the
 

233
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,399
outside I might throw my eyes to the
inside before I crossover going back the

234
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:14,409
inside before I crossover going back the
 

235
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,750
inside before I crossover going back the
opposite direction so really think about

236
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
opposite direction so really think about
 

237
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,369
opposite direction so really think about
and anytime you're working on your

238
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:17,379
and anytime you're working on your
 

239
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,569
and anytime you're working on your
crossover or working on your ball

240
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:18,579
crossover or working on your ball
 

241
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,580
crossover or working on your ball
handles think about selling your eyes in

242
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:20,590
handles think about selling your eyes in
 

243
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,259
handles think about selling your eyes in
the direction of the initial dribble not

244
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:22,269
the direction of the initial dribble not
 

245
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,580
the direction of the initial dribble not
the direction that you're going on the

246
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,590
the direction that you're going on the
 

247
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,020
the direction that you're going on the
crossover if you do that you're gonna

248
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,030
crossover if you do that you're gonna
 

249
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,849
crossover if you do that you're gonna
automatically have a much more impactful

250
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:26,859
automatically have a much more impactful
 

251
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,110
automatically have a much more impactful
crossover because the defense is gonna

252
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,120
crossover because the defense is gonna
 

253
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,759
crossover because the defense is gonna
jump on it every single time alright so

254
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:29,769
jump on it every single time alright so
 

255
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,289
jump on it every single time alright so
the next hidden secret to a crossover is

256
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:31,299
the next hidden secret to a crossover is
 

257
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:32,849
the next hidden secret to a crossover is
what we call ball control basically

258
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:32,859
what we call ball control basically
 

259
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,229
what we call ball control basically
meaning that is at an elite level ball

260
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
meaning that is at an elite level ball
 

261
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,819
meaning that is at an elite level ball
handler you've got to be able to control

262
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:35,829
handler you've got to be able to control
 

263
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,189
handler you've got to be able to control
the basketball in 360 degrees around

264
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:38,199
the basketball in 360 degrees around
 

265
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,259
the basketball in 360 degrees around
your body right so what a lot of players

266
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:40,269
your body right so what a lot of players
 

267
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,640
your body right so what a lot of players
do is they'll work on their handles and

268
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:41,650
do is they'll work on their handles and
 

269
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,259
do is they'll work on their handles and
they'll they'll do their crossovers and

270
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:43,269
they'll they'll do their crossovers and
 

271
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:44,339
they'll they'll do their crossovers and
they'll do their figure eights and

272
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:44,349
they'll do their figure eights and
 

273
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,449
they'll do their figure eights and
they'll do all their you know dribbling

274
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:45,459
they'll do all their you know dribbling
 

275
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,470
they'll do all their you know dribbling
drills and all that sort of stuff but

276
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
drills and all that sort of stuff but
 

277
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,659
drills and all that sort of stuff but
they don't really work on that

278
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:47,669
they don't really work on that
 

279
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,400
they don't really work on that
360-degree control at all levels so

280
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,410
360-degree control at all levels so
 

281
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,050
360-degree control at all levels so
basically an illegal elbow ball handler

282
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,060
basically an illegal elbow ball handler
 

283
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,479
basically an illegal elbow ball handler
can control the basketball in 360

284
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:54,489
can control the basketball in 360
 

285
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,039
can control the basketball in 360
degrees all around their body at any

286
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,049
degrees all around their body at any
 

287
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,289
degrees all around their body at any
height so from your ankle height all the

288
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:58,299
height so from your ankle height all the
 

289
00:03:58,299 --> 00:03:59,670
height so from your ankle height all the
way up to your shoulder height so when

290
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
way up to your shoulder height so when
 

291
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,020
way up to your shoulder height so when
you're training and working on your

292
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,030
you're training and working on your
 

293
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,939
you're training and working on your
crossover really work on these different

294
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:02,949
crossover really work on these different
 

295
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,949
crossover really work on these different
levels and work on this 360 degrees if

296
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
levels and work on this 360 degrees if
 

297
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,569
levels and work on this 360 degrees if
I'm working on my crossovers I might

298
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:06,579
I'm working on my crossovers I might
 

299
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,759
I'm working on my crossovers I might
work on hanging it back out here by my

300
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:08,769
work on hanging it back out here by my
 

301
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,469
work on hanging it back out here by my
shoulder and then crossing it back

302
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:10,479
shoulder and then crossing it back
 

303
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,390
shoulder and then crossing it back
through I might work on putting it back

304
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
through I might work on putting it back
 

305
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,460
through I might work on putting it back
at a funky angle behind my legs and then

306
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,470
at a funky angle behind my legs and then
 

307
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,110
at a funky angle behind my legs and then
wrapping it behind my back right if you

308
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,120
wrapping it behind my back right if you
 

309
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,810
wrapping it behind my back right if you
can work on that 360 degree control it

310
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:18,820
can work on that 360 degree control it
 

311
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,219
can work on that 360 degree control it
doesn't matter where the ball bounces

312
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:20,229
doesn't matter where the ball bounces

so work on that ball control and that's

318
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,090
so work on that ball control and that's
