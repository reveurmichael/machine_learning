========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move up 2 times (from y=5 to 7) and left 5 times (from x=8 to 3) to reach the apple at (3,7). Starting with UP avoids reversing the initial RIGHT direction. Moving UP twice positions the head at (8,7), then moving LEFT five times navigates to (3,7). Each intermediate move checks for collisions with the body (which shifts safely) and stays within grid bounds. After reaching the apple, there are legal moves (e.g., UP) to avoid trapping."
