========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (5,6) to eat the apple at (3,1). 

First, I need to understand the current state. The head is at (5,6), and the body is behind it: [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]. So the body extends down and right from the head.

The direction is LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse direction. Wait, no—the current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving to the left. So in the next move, it can't choose RIGHT, but can choose any other direction except for opposite of current? No, wait, the rules say you cannot reverse. So if current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT, and vice versa.

Wait, no—the movement rules say that you cannot choose the opposite direction. So since current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. Also, the initial direction is NONE? Or it's given as LEFT in this case.

So starting with direction LEFT, so first move can't be RIGHT.

The apple is at (3,1), which is two units left and five units down from the head. So moving primarily to the left and then down seems necessary.

But let's check the path. If the snake moves LEFT from (5,6) to (4,6). Then next move could be LEFT again to 3,6, but wait—the apple is at 3,1. That would require moving down five steps.

Wait, but the body is currently behind the head. After moving left, the body will shift accordingly.

But perhaps a better approach is to plan the moves step by step.

Let me outline possible moves:

1. The snake starts at (5,6), direction LEFT.
2. Move 1: LEFT to (4,6). Check for collision:
   - New head (4,6) should not be in body cells except tail when it's about to move.
   Body after moving would add the old head (5,6) to the front, then remove the tail if needed.

Wait, but since we're moving left, let's see:

After first move to (4,6), body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ]? Wait no—the body list given is [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)], which are the segments behind the head.

So when moving left to 4,6:

- New head is 4,6.
- Body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ]? Or wait: The body list is from behind the head. So if the head was at 5,6 and moves to 4,6, then the new body starts with 5,6 as the first body segment.

Wait, no—the movement step says that after computing new_head, we insert the old head into the front of the BODY list. Then, unless eating apple, remove the tail.

So in this case, moving from (5,6) to (4,6):

- New head is 4,6.
- Insert (5,6) at front of body: new body becomes [(5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)].
- Then, since apple isn't eaten, remove the tail (5,7). So the new body after moving is [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].

Wait, but wait: The initial body list given is [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]. After inserting old head (5,6) at front, it becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ]. Then, if not growing, remove the last element (5,7). So body becomes [(5,6), (6,6), (6,7)].

So the new snake is head at 4,6 and body [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].

Next move: from direction LEFT, can't choose RIGHT. Let's see what options we have: UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

But moving further left would take us to (3,6). But let's check if that's safe.

Wait, but the apple is at (3,1), which is two lefts and five downs from current head position after first move. So maybe it's better to start moving down after a few left moves.

Alternatively, perhaps we should plan a path that goes around the body.

But let me think step by step.

Move 1: LEFT to 4,6.

Now, can we go LEFT again? Let's see:

Move 2: LEFT to 3,6. Check for collision with body.

Body after move 1 is [(5,6), (6,6), (6,7)]. So new head at 3,6 is not in the body except perhaps if it's the tail.

But wait, when moving to 3,6:

- New head (3,6).
- Insert old head (4,6) into front of body: [ (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].
- Remove tail (6,7) unless eating apple.

So new body becomes [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6)].

No collision with head at 3,6? The body segments are now 4,6; 5,6; 6,6. So 3,6 is not in the body except when it's the tail's next move. Wait, no—because the body hasn't moved yet, so the new_head (3,6) should not be in any of the body cells except for when the tail is about to move.

Wait, but after inserting old head into front, the body becomes [4,6, 5,6, 6,6]. So 3,6 is not in that list. So it's safe.

So move 2: LEFT to 3,6.

Now, can we go LEFT again? That would take us to 2,6, which is further left but still needs to get down.

But perhaps moving down now would be better.

Alternatively, after reaching (3,6), next move could be DOWN to 3,5. Let's see:

Move 3: DOWN from 3,6 to 3,5.

Check collision:

- New head is 3,5.
- Insert old head (3,6) into front of body: [ (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) ].
Wait no—current body after move 2 is [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]. So inserting the old head (3,6) makes it [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)].

Then, since we're not eating apple (apple is at 3,1), remove tail (6,6). New body: [ (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ].

So new snake: head at 3,5; body [3,6,4,6,5,6].

Wait, no—the body after insertion is [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]. Remove tail → [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].

So new head 3,5. Body segments: 3,6; 4,6; 5,6. So the new head is not in any body cell except perhaps when the tail moves. But since we're moving to 3,5, which is not part of the current body (which is [3,6,4,6,5,6]), it's safe.

So move 3: DOWN to 3,5.

Now, next move could be LEFT to 2,5? Wait no—the apple is at 3,1. So we need to go down more.

Wait, the head is now at (3,5). To get to (3,1), it's five moves down. But the body might block that path if not managed properly.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving DOWN once, start moving RIGHT or LEFT again to navigate around the body.

But let me think about possible collisions. After each move, I need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail's next position.

Wait, in the movement update rules, when checking for collision, if the new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, then it's a collision.

So after each move, the new head must not be in any body segment except possibly where the tail is about to move.

In our current state after three moves:

Head at 3,5; body [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].

Next possible move: DOWN again. Let's try that.

Move 4: DOWN to 3,4.

Check collision: new head is 3,4. The body segments are [3,6,4,6,5,6]. So 3,4 isn't in the body except if it's the tail's next move. Wait, no—the body after insertion would be [(3,5), ... ]? No, wait:

Wait, when moving from 3,5 to 3,4:

- New head is (3,4).
- Insert old head (3,5) into front of body: the current body is [3,6,4,6,5,6]. So inserting (3,5) makes it [(3,5), 3,6,4,6,5,6].
- Then remove tail (5,6) if not eating apple.

So new body becomes [(3,5), 3,6,4,6].

Wait no—the current body after move 3 was [3,6,4,6,5,6]. After inserting the old head (3,5), it's [3,5,3,6,4,6,5,6]. Then remove tail → [3,5,3,6,4,6].

Wait that seems confusing. Let me clarify:

After move 3: head is at 3,5; body is [3,6,4,6,5,6]—wait no.

No, after move 2, the body was [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]. Then in move 3, moving to 3,5:

- Insert old head (3,6) into front → [ (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) ].
- Remove tail (6,6). So body becomes [ (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ].

So after move 3:

Head: 3,5; body: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].

So when moving from 3,5 to 3,4 in move 4:

- New head is 3,4.
- Insert old head (3,5) into front of body: [ (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ].
- Remove tail (5,6). So new body becomes [ (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) ].

So the new head is 3,4, which is not in the body except for when the tail moves. The body after insertion was [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)], so 3,4 isn't part of that, except perhaps if it's the next move of the tail.

But since the new head is 3,4 and the body segments are [3,5; 3,6; 4,6], there is no collision. So move 4 is safe: DOWN to 3,4.

Continue this pattern:

Move 5: DOWN to 3,3.

Similarly, check collision:

- New head (3,3).
- Insert old head (3,4) into front of body [ (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) ] → [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)].
- Remove tail (4,6). So new body is [ (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) ].

No collision with head at 3,3.

Move 5: safe.

Move 6: DOWN to 3,2.

Same process:

- New head 3,2.
- Insert old head (3,3) into front of body [ (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) ] → [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)].
- Remove tail (3,6). So new body is [ (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ].

No collision with 3,2.

Move 7: DOWN to 3,1. That's the apple!

So let's see:

After move 6: head at 3,2; body [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)].

Now, move to 3,1.

- New head 3,1.
- Insert old head (3,2) into front of body → [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ].
- Since we're at apple position, we don't remove the tail; instead, add new segment.

Wait no: when eating apple, you add a new segment without removing the old one. So body becomes [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ] plus the inserted old head? Wait, perhaps I'm confused.

No—the process is:

After computing new_head, insert old_head into front of body. Then, if not eating apple, remove tail. If eating apple, keep all segments.

So in this case, since we're at apple position (3,1), after moving there, we insert the old head (3,2) into front of body:

Body before: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] → becomes [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ].

Then, since eating apple, we don't remove the tail. So new body is [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ].

Thus, after moving to 3,1, the snake has grown by one segment.

So that's seven moves:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN
7. DOWN

Wait no—each move is a step. So starting at (5,6):

Move 1: LEFT → 4,6

Move 2: LEFT → 3,6

Move 3: DOWN → 3,5

Move 4: DOWN → 3,4

Move 5: DOWN → 3,3

Move 6: DOWN → 3,2

Move 7: DOWN → 3,1

So seven moves in total. But wait, the direction after each move changes.

Wait no—each move is a step, but the direction can change. So for example:

After first move (LEFT), next move could be different.

But to get from (5,6) to (3,1), moving LEFT twice and then DOWN five times seems possible without collision.

But let's check each move for potential collisions.

Move 1: LEFT to 4,6. Safe as discussed.

Move 2: LEFT to 3,6. Safe.

Move 3: DOWN to 3,5. Safe.

Move 4: DOWN to 3,4. Safe.

Move 5: DOWN to 3,3. Safe.

Move 6: DOWN to 3,2. Safe.

Move 7: DOWN to 3,1. Safe.

So yes, this seems possible.

But wait—after each move, the direction can be changed. But in our plan, after moving LEFT twice, we change to DOWN for all subsequent moves.

Is there any restriction on changing direction? No, except that you cannot choose the opposite of the previous direction.

Wait no—the movement rules say you can't reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, next move can be any except RIGHT. Similarly, if you're moving in a new direction, as long as it's not the exact opposite.

So after first move (LEFT), second move is also LEFT—allowed because it's same direction.

Third move: DOWN from 3,6 to 3,5—is that allowed? Yes, because previous direction was LEFT; DOWN isn't opposite of LEFT.

Fourth move: DOWN again—is allowed as same direction.

And so on.

So the plan seems feasible.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

Move 1: LEFT

Move 2: LEFT

Moves 3-7: DOWN (five times)

Total of seven moves.

But wait, let me check if moving down from 3,6 to 3,5 is possible without collision with body segments.

After move 2: head at 3,6; body [4,6;5,6;6,6].

Wait no—after two LEFT moves:

Move 1: HEAD at 4,6. Body becomes [(5,6), (6,6), (6,7)] after removing tail.

Move 2: HEAD at 3,6. Insert old head (4,6) into front → body is [ (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ]. Then remove tail (6,7). So new body is [ (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) ].

So when moving DOWN from 3,6 to 3,5:

- New head at 3,5.
- Insert old head (3,6) into front → [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)].
- Remove tail (6,6). So new body is [ (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ].

So 3,5 is not in the body segments except when the tail moves. So no collision.

Same logic applies for each subsequent DOWN move.

Thus, this path is safe.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

1. LEFT

2. LEFT

3. DOWN

4. DOWN

5. DOWN

6. DOWN

7. DOWN

So in terms of direction changes:

After first two moves: LEFT.

Then, change to DOWN and continue for five more moves.

Thus, the total number of moves is seven.
</think>

The snake can move left twice and then down five times to reach the apple without colliding with its body. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Move LEFT from (5,6) to (4,6).
2. Move LEFT again to (3,6).
3. Change direction to DOWN and move to (3,5).
4. Continue moving DOWN to (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), and finally (3,1).

The total moves needed are 7.

Answer: \boxed{7}
