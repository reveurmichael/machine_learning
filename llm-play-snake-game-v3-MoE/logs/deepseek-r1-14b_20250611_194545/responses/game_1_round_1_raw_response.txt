========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from (5,5) to eat the apple at (5,1). Let's break it down step by step.

First, the head is at (5,5), and the apple is directly below at (5,1). Since both are on the same x-coordinate, I need to move down. But wait, looking at the direction, if the current direction is "NONE," that means the snake isn't moving yet, so any first move is allowed.

The body cells list is empty, which means the snake's length is just 1 (head only). So initially, there's no body in the way.

So the simplest path would be to move directly down. But I need to check if that's possible without causing a collision.

Let me visualize the grid:

- The head is at (5,5), which is near the top-right.
- The apple is at (5,1), which is much lower on the same column.

The Manhattan distance between them is |5-5| + |5-1| = 0 +4=4. So I need to move down four times to reach the apple.

But wait, when moving towards the apple, each time the snake moves, it will add a new head position and potentially grow if it eats the apple.

Wait, no. On the first step, since the body is empty, after moving, the body will be [old_head], but only if not growing.

Wait, let me think again about movement rules:

When moving normally (not eating an apple), the snake's length stays the same. So when you move towards the apple without eating it yet, you add the new head and remove the tail. But since initially, there's no body, each move just replaces the head position.

But in this case, since the apple is at (5,1), and the head starts at (5,5), I can plan a straight path down.

Let me outline the moves:

Move 1: DOWN from (5,5) to (5,4)
Move 2: DOWN from (5,4) to (5,3)
Move 3: DOWN from (5,3) to (5,2)
Move 4: DOWN from (5,2) to (5,1)

Each time, after moving, the snake's head is updated. Since the body is empty initially, no collision with itself can occur except if it steps into a position that will be occupied by the tail.

But wait, in this case, because the body is empty, the tail doesn't exist. So each move should be safe as long as the new head doesn't go out of bounds or collide with any body cells (which are none).

So the sequence would be four DOWN moves. But let me think if there's any other consideration.

After moving to (5,1), since that's where the apple is, the snake will grow by one segment. So after eating the apple, the body becomes [(5,5)], and the head is at (5,1). The new body would be [old_head], so no collision with itself.

But according to the movement rules, when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail this turn, so the snake's length increases by one. So after eating, the body becomes longer.

Now, I need to make sure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any existing body segments except possibly the tail. But in this case, since the body is empty until after moving, there are no body segments to collide with.

Wait, but when you first move down, let's say from (5,5) to (5,4), the body becomes [ (5,5) ] because we added the old head. Then, in the next step, moving to (5,3), the new head is (5,3). The body after this move would be [ (5,4), (5,5) ]? Wait no, let me clarify.

Wait, the movement process:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check collision: for each new_head, check if it's in any BODY cell except possibly the tail when that tail is about to move.
3. If safe:
   a. Insert old head into body list.
   b. If new_head == apple, grow (do not remove tail).
   c. Else, remove last element of body.

So for initial state: HEAD = (5,5), BODY=[]

Move 1: DOWN
new_head = (5,4)
Check collision: noBODY segments except none, so safe.
Update:
Insert old head into body list → BODY = [ (5,5) ]
Since new_head is not apple (apple at (5,1)), remove last element (which is empty), so BODY remains [ (5,5) ].

Wait, but after moving, the HEAD becomes (5,4). The full snake S would be [ (5,4), (5,5) ]?

Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.

After move 1:

- new_head is (5,4).
- Since no collision, proceed.
- Insert old head (5,5) at front of BODY → BODY becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Since new_head != apple, remove the last element of BODY (which was empty), so BODY remains [ (5,5) ]?
Wait, that doesn't make sense because after inserting, it's [ (5,5) ], and then removing the tail would leave an empty list again. But that can't be right because the snake is now two segments long: head at (5,4), and body at (5,5). So perhaps I misunderstood step 3c.

Wait, let me read movement update rule 3:

a. Insert old head position at front of BODY → becomes BODY1.
b. If new_head == apple, grow: do not remove tail.
c. Else, move normally: remove last element of body (tail).

So for the first move, after inserting old head, BODY is [ (5,5) ]. Then since new_head is not apple, we proceed to step c: remove the last element of the body. But the body was just [ (5,5) ], so removing the tail would leave it empty.

Wait that can't be right because then after moving down once, the snake's length remains 1, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps when you move, regardless of whether you eat the apple or not, you add the old head to the body list, and if you don't eat the apple, you remove the tail. But in this case, since the initial body is empty, adding the old head makes the body [ (5,5) ], then removing the tail would leave an empty body again because the tail was just added.

Wait that can't be correct because when the snake moves without eating the apple, it's length should remain the same. So initial length is 1; after moving, you add one segment and remove one, so it stays at 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think in terms of steps:

Initial state:
HEAD = (5,5)
BODY = []

Move: DOWN → new_head = (5,4)

Check collision: no body segments to collide with, safe.

Update body:
a. Insert old head (5,5) at front → BODY becomes [ (5,5) ]
b. Since new_head != apple, remove the last element of body → but the body is now [ (5,5) ], so removing it makes the body empty again.

So after this move, HEAD = (5,4), BODY = [].

Wait that can't be right because then the snake's length would remain 1, which contradicts the movement rules where moving adds a segment but also removes one, keeping the length same unless eating apple.

I think I must have made an error in understanding how the body is updated.

Let me look at the movement example given:

In the normal move example:
S = [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)]
Choose LEFT → new_head (3,4)
Check collision: safe.
Update body:
a. Insert old head (4,4) → BODY becomes [ (4,4), (4,3) ]
b. Since not eating apple, remove tail → BODY becomes [ (4,4) ]
So the new S is [ (3,4), (4,4) ]

Wait, so in this case, the body after a move is always one less than the inserted old head unless you eat an apple.

Ah, I see. So when you don't eat an apple, you add the old head to the front of the body list and then remove the last element (the tail), thus keeping the length same as before plus 1 (inserted) minus 1 (removed).

So in the initial case:

After moving down once:
- new_head is (5,4)
- Insert old head into body → BODY becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Remove last element of body → which was nothing before, but after inserting, it's [ (5,5) ], so removing it makes BODY empty again.

Wait that can't be right because then the snake's length remains 1. So perhaps in the initial move, since the body is empty, adding and then removing doesn't change anything.

I think I need to clarify:

The movement rule step 3a: Insert old head at front of the body list (BODY becomes [old_head] + BODY).

Step 3c: remove last element of body.

So for initial state:

After move 1:
- new_head = (5,4)
- insert old head → body = [ (5,5) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element (which is (5,5)) → body becomes empty.

Thus, after the first move, the snake's length remains 1, with HEAD at (5,4).

But that seems counterintuitive. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps when the body was empty before moving, inserting old_head makes it [old_head], and then removing the last element (which is the same as old_head) leaves it empty again.

So in effect, each move without eating apple just replaces the head's position but keeps the length the same.

But that would mean that after four moves down, the head would be at (5,1), with no body segments. Then, upon reaching the apple, since new_head == apple, we do not remove the tail.

So let's simulate:

Move 1: DOWN to (5,4)
BODY becomes [ (5,5) ] after inserting old head.
Then, since not eating apple, remove last element → BODY is empty again.
HEAD is now (5,4).

Move 2: DOWN to (5,3)
Insert old_head (5,4) into body → [ (5,4) ]
Not eating apple → remove last element → body empty.
HEAD at (5,3)

Similarly for Move 3 and 4.

After four moves:

Move 4: DOWN to (5,1), which is the apple's position.

So now:

new_head = (5,1)
BODY after inserting old head (5,2) → [ (5,2) ]
Since new_head == apple, do not remove tail → BODY remains [ (5,2) ]

Thus, the snake's length becomes 2: HEAD at (5,1), BODY at (5,2).

Now, this is safe because the head is at (5,1), and body is at (5,2). No collision.

So, yes, four moves DOWN should work.

But wait, let me check if moving directly down without any other considerations could cause a problem in future steps. But since the apple is directly below and there are no obstacles or other body parts, it's safe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of an alternative path, but given that the apple is directly below, the most efficient way is to go straight down.

But let me consider another approach: maybe moving left or right first could cause issues? No, since there are no body segments to collide with yet. So moving directly down is fine.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, the snake's length increases, so next moves would have a body segment behind, but since we've already eaten the apple and the problem is only about reaching it, that might not matter here.

Wait, in this case, the user only needs to reach the apple once. So four DOWN moves should suffice.

So, in conclusion, the sequence of moves is:

1. DOWN
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN

This will move the head from (5,5) down to (5,1), where it can eat the apple.
</think>

The snake needs to move directly downward four times to reach the apple at (5,1).

Step-by-step explanation:

- The snake's head starts at position (5,5).
- The apple is located at (5,1), which is four moves down on the same column.
- Since the initial body is empty and no obstacles are present, moving straight down without deviation is safe.
- Each move adds a new head position and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.
- Upon reaching the apple's position after four downward moves, the snake will grow by one segment.

Answer:
The snake should move DOWN consecutively four times. The sequence is:

\boxed{DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN}
