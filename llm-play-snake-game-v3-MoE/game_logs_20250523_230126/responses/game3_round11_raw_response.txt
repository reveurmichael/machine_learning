========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to help this snake in the classic Snake game. The problem is about planning a safe path from the head position (5,5) to the apple at (4,9). I need to make sure that I don't collide with anything and follow all the rules given.

First, I'll start by understanding the inputs. The snake's body cells are provided as a list starting from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So in this case, if the body cells are empty and not including the head, it means the snake has just one segment—the head itself. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because a snake should have multiple segments. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the problem says the input is an ordered list of (x,y) positions occupied by the body cells from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if it's empty, maybe the snake has only one segment—just the head? That doesn't make sense because a snake typically has multiple parts connected end-to-end.

But in this case, since the input is an empty list for the body segments, perhaps it means that there are no other body cells besides the head. So the snake is just two cells: head and tail. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting it—perhaps the list being empty means that all the body cells are already gone, so the only segment is the head.

Wait, let's read the problem statement again. It says "Each BODYi is adjacent (Manhattan distance = 1) to its predecessor." So each subsequent cell in the list is connected by one step. If the list is empty, then there's no body segments besides the head. That could mean that the snake has only two cells: the head and maybe a tail? Or perhaps it just means that after this move, there are no more body segments.

Wait, but if the snake is to be moved, I think it should have at least one segment before moving. So an empty list might mean that all body cells except the head are already consumed or removed.

So, given that, let's proceed with the information provided. The snake's head is at (5,5), and we need to move towards (4,9). The apple is at (4,9).

Now, I'll outline the steps needed:

1. **Movement Rules**: Each turn, compute new_head based on direction. Check for collisions—new_head outside grid or coinciding with non-tail body cells. Update body positions by shifting tails to next position without eating the apple if it's reached.

2. **Collision Detection**: If the new_head is outside the grid or collides with any body cell except the tail, the snake dies. Also, when moving towards the apple, after eating it, there must be at least one legal move in the next turn to avoid immediate trapping.

3. **Path Planning**: Find a path from (5,5) to (4,9) that doesn't collide with any body cells, considering the current and future positions of the tail as it moves.

Let me think about how to model this. The snake starts at (5,5), and I need to reach (4,9). Let's calculate the required movement in terms of directions. From (5,5) to (4,9):

- x decreases by 1: so LEFT is one possible direction.
- y increases by 4: so UP is another option.

But moving directly might cause collisions or immediate traps. I need a path that allows me to eat the apple without getting trapped.

Given the snake's current state, it has only two cells—head and tail (since the list is empty). So when moving, the new_head should not land on any of these cells except possibly the tail if we don't eat the apple yet.

Let me outline possible directions:

- LEFT: x decreases by 1. But from (5,5), LEFT would take us to (4,5). I need to check if that cell is already occupied or a body segment. The list is empty, so all cells are free except the head and tail, but since it's just two cells, maybe (5,5) and the tail elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the body cells when the list is empty. If the list is empty, that means there are no other segments besides the head? Or does it mean that all the body segments except the current one have been removed?

I think in this case, since the snake's body cells start with the immediate behind the head to tail, and if that list is empty, it could imply that after moving, the only segment is the new_head (the head) and perhaps no other body cells. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the list being empty means there are no other segments besides the current one—so when you move, all subsequent moves can't affect any other segments beyond the head. That might simplify things because after each move, only the new_head is updated, and nothing else changes unless eating the apple.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the list is empty, the tail would be at (5,5) as well, perhaps? Or maybe not—it depends on how the body cells are structured.

I think I need to approach this step by step. Let's consider each possible direction and see if it leads to a safe path.

Option 1: Move RIGHT

From (5,5), moving RIGHT would take us to (6,5). Now, is (6,5) already part of the snake? If the list is empty, perhaps all cells are free except where occupied. So (6,5) isn't in the body cells yet.

But wait, after moving, if I choose RIGHT, what happens?

- New_head = (6,5)
- Check collisions: since it's the first move, there's no collision with any body cells except possibly the tail. But since the list is empty, maybe all are free.
- Update the body:

   a. Insert old head at front → [(5,5), (6,5)]
   
   b. Since we didn't eat the apple yet, remove the tail → new full S would be [ (5,5), (6,5) ]

So the next turn, I can move in any direction as long as I don't get caught.

But this seems too easy—maybe it's not the best approach. Perhaps moving towards (4,9) directly is better.

Option 2: Move LEFT

From (5,5), LEFT would take us to (4,5). Let's see:

- New_head = (4,5)
- Check if (4,5) is outside grid? x=4 is within bounds. So that's fine.
- But wait, since the snake's body cells are empty except for head and tail, which hasn't moved yet, this seems okay.

But then, moving LEFT to (4,5), and so on—maybe possible.

Option 3: Move UP

From (5,5), UP would take us to (5,6). Let's see:

- New_head = (5,6)
- Check if (5,6) is in the grid. Yes.
- No collision with body cells yet.

Then, remove the tail and insert head at front → new S: [ (5,6), (5,5) ]

But let me think about the movement:

Each move affects the snake's position and body structure. I need to plan a path that avoids any collisions.

Given the apple is at (4,9), which is to the right and above (5,5). So perhaps moving towards decreasing x and increasing y would be better—LEFT and UP directions.

But let me think about the list of body cells. If the snake's body segments are empty, it means that all the positions except head are free. So, after each move, I can only affect the new_head, and the tail (if any) remains where it was before this move.

Wait, in this case, if the list is empty, does that mean there are no other segments besides the current one? Or is it indicating that all body cells except head have been removed?

I think it's the latter—so after moving, only the new_head changes, and any future moves don't affect the snake beyond shifting tails. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the list being empty means that there are no other segments besides the current one, so the entire body is just the head. That would make sense because if all other body cells have been removed or shifted away.

In that case, when moving, only the new_head changes, and the rest of the body (which has nothing) remains.

So, let's model this:

- Initial state: [head] = [(5,5)]
- To move:
   - New_head is computed.
   - Check for collisions with non-tail cells in the list. Since it's empty, all are free except maybe the tail?
   Wait, I'm getting confused.

If the snake's body consists of only the head (since the list is empty), then moving would change the new_head to a different cell, and that becomes the new head. The rest of the body doesn't exist beyond the head.

So, when choosing a direction:

- For LEFT: move x decreases by 1
- UP: y increases by 1
- RIGHT: x increases by 1 (but from (5,5) to (6,5), which is okay)
- DOWN: y decreases by 1

But wait, if the list is empty, after moving, only new_head changes. So any other body cells are gone.

Therefore, when choosing a direction:

- If I choose LEFT, I go to (4,5). The tail was at (5,5), but since all other body segments have been shifted out of range or not affected, the tail is now at (4,5).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If the snake's body consists only of the head, then after moving LEFT, the new_head is (4,5). The rest of the body doesn't exist beyond that, so there's nothing else to shift.

But I'm not sure if this is correct. Maybe the list being empty means that all other segments have been removed or shifted out of the grid? Or perhaps it just indicates that after this move, only the new_head affects the state.

I think in this case, moving LEFT would change the snake's head to (4,5), and since there are no other body cells, any further moves won't affect anything else. So from (5,5) LEFT to (4,5).

But let's see: is (4,5) a collision? Since it's the first move, perhaps not.

So, after moving LEFT:

- new_head = (4,5)
- Update body: insert head at front → [(4,5), ... ] and remove tail, which is now... Hmm, wait. The list was empty before, so maybe all body segments are removed except the current one? Or perhaps the rest of the body remains in place.

This part is a bit unclear. If after moving, there's no change to any other cells beyond shifting the head, then the next move can only affect that new_head and possibly shift tails if needed.

But since the list was empty, maybe all body segments are gone except for the current one—so when you move LEFT, you just have a new_head at (4,5), and no further changes in other parts of the snake.

So from (5,5) LEFT to (4,5). Then, in the next move, you can choose directions again.

But perhaps this is too simplistic. Maybe I should model the body as having multiple segments beyond the head, even if the list is empty. So each cell in the list represents a segment of the snake that connects sequentially.

In that case, moving from (5,5) to (4,5) would require knowing where else the body cells are connected.

But without knowing their positions, it's difficult. Maybe I should assume that all other segments have been shifted out of the grid or removed.

Given this uncertainty, perhaps I'll proceed by considering that each segment in the list represents a separate part of the snake that is moved accordingly when the direction changes.

So for example:

If the body cells are [(5,5), (4,5)], meaning two segments: head at (5,5) and tail at (4,5). Then moving LEFT would change the new_head to (4,5), insert it at front → [(4,5), (5,5)].

But wait, that might not make sense because from (5,5) LEFT to (4,5), which is one segment. But if we have two segments, maybe each direction affects multiple positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the body cells are a list where each subsequent cell is connected by one step, so for [(a,b)], the snake has only the head at that point. So moving from (5,5) to (4,5), with no other body cells—so that's okay.

In any case, I think it's better to proceed by considering possible paths and checking for collisions and traps.

Option 1: Move RIGHT

From (5,5) → (6,5)

Check if (6,5) is within the grid. Yes. No collision with body cells since list is empty. So allowed.

Update:

- Insert head at front → [(6,5)]
- Remove tail, which doesn't exist yet. Hmm, perhaps all segments are gone except for the new_head? Or no?

I think in this case, after moving RIGHT, only (6,5) changes, and the rest of the body is removed.

Wait, maybe not. If the list was empty before, then each segment beyond the head has been shifted out of view or removed. So when you move, only the new_head affects the snake's state.

So, after moving RIGHT to (6,5), the snake would have [(6,5)], with no other body cells.

Next move: any direction is possible.

But perhaps this isn't leading me towards (4,9). Let's consider another option.

Option 2: Move LEFT

From (5,5) → (4,5)

Check for collision: not outside grid. No collisions except maybe the tail?

Since list is empty, all are free. So allowed.

Update:

- Insert head at front → [(4,5)]
- Remove tail, which was not present before—so perhaps all other body cells have been shifted out of view or removed.

But I'm not entirely clear on this part. Maybe in this scenario, moving LEFT leads to (4,5), and the rest remains as is.

Option 3: Move UP

From (5,5) → (5,6)

Check if (5,6) is within grid. Yes.

No collision with body cells. So allowed.

Update:

- Insert head at front → [(5,6)]
- Remove tail, which was not present before—so all other segments have been shifted out of view or removed.

Option 4: Move DOWN

From (5,5) → (5,4)

Check if (5,4) is within grid. Yes.

No collision with body cells. So allowed.

Update:

- Insert head at front → [(5,4)]
- Remove tail, which was not present before—segments have been shifted out of view or removed.

But I'm not sure how the body cells are structured when moving in these directions if the list is empty. It might be that each move only affects one cell beyond the current head.

Wait, perhaps if the list is [(5,5)], meaning only the head exists—so after moving LEFT to (4,5), the tail was at (5,5). So in this case, when you move LEFT, the new_head is (4,5), and since all other body cells have been removed or shifted out of view, the snake now has just the new_head.

Alternatively, perhaps each direction affects multiple cells based on the list. For example, moving LEFT would make the new_head at (x-1,y), but also affect any subsequent segments that were connected by one step.

This is getting complicated without a clear model. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another idea: since the body cells are given as a list starting from just behind the head to the tail, and if this list is empty, then after each move, only the new_head changes, and all other body cells have been removed or shifted out of view.

Therefore, when choosing directions:

- LEFT moves x decreases by 1
- UP increases y by 1 (since from (5,5), moving up would be increasing y)
- RIGHT increases x by 1
- DOWN decreases y by 1

But wait, if the list is empty, after each move, only new_head changes. So for any given direction, the movement affects just one cell in the snake's body.

Therefore, to reach (4,9), I need a path that moves towards decreasing x and increasing y, while avoiding possible collisions with other segments.

But without knowing exactly how the body cells are connected beyond the head, it's difficult. So perhaps moving LEFT and UP would be better options.

Alternatively, maybe it's safer to move LEFT and UP because they bring us closer to (4,9). But I need to make sure that during each movement, there are no collisions with any body segments except possibly the tail after this move.

Wait, but if the list is empty, then all other body cells have been shifted out of view or removed. So when moving LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5), perhaps the rest of the snake has been shifted out of the grid, making it safe.

Similarly, moving UP would take us to (5,6), which is still within the grid.

So in that case, both LEFT and UP seem like good moves without worrying about collisions with other body cells.

Wait, but after moving, only new_head changes. So for example:

If I choose LEFT: new_head = (4,5). The rest of the body (if any) has been shifted out of view or removed. Therefore, there are no other segments to collide with.

So in this case, from (5,5), moving LEFT is safe.

Similarly, moving UP would take us to (5,6).

But perhaps it's better to move both directions and see which one leads me towards the apple without getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I should try a different approach: think about how each possible direction affects the snake's body and where it can go next.

Another idea is that since the list is empty, any movement from (5,5) will just shift the new_head. So perhaps moving LEFT and UP are okay, but if we choose to move both, we might have a longer path but more flexibility in future moves.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT or DOWN could lead us towards other areas, but since (4,9) is above and to the left of (5,5), moving down isn't helpful. Similarly, moving right would take us further away from y=9.

So perhaps LEFT and UP are better options.

Wait, but after moving LEFT, we can then choose another direction. For example:

- From (4,5) [new_head], moving DOWN to (4,4). Wait, that's even further down, which is not helpful for reaching (4,9).

Alternatively, maybe if I move UP from (4,5), I get to (4,6). Then, perhaps move LEFT again?

Wait, but after moving UP from (4,5) → (4,6), the new_head would be (4,6). The rest of the body is gone because all other segments have been shifted out.

So from (4,6), I can choose directions again. Moving DOWN to (4,5)—but that's already been done. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (3,6) or UP to (4,7).

But this seems like it could take a while and might not lead me directly to (4,9).

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider choosing LEFT and then DOWN? Let's see.

Wait, after moving LEFT from (5,5) → (4,5). Then, in the next move, if I move DOWN from (4,5), but that would take me to (4,4), which is below y=9. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I should choose another direction first.

Wait, perhaps moving LEFT and then UP?

From (5,5) → (4,5). Then, in the next move, moving UP to (4,6). From there, perhaps moving LEFT to (3,6), but that's going back up, which might not be helpful. Alternatively, moving DOWN again? But that would take me further down.

This seems like a dead end.

Alternatively, maybe I should choose another initial direction.

Wait, perhaps the list being empty is causing confusion. If each cell in the body represents a separate segment connected to the previous one by a single step, then if the body has multiple segments, moving in certain directions could affect multiple cells at once.

But without knowing how many segments or their positions beyond the head, it's hard to say.

Another thought: perhaps the list is empty because each segment was shifted out of view after this move. So each direction affects only one cell.

Therefore, from (5,5), any movement in directions LEFT, UP, RIGHT, or DOWN will change only one cell in the snake's body. The rest have been removed or shifted out.

Therefore, the snake can move safely into any adjacent cell unless another segment exists that is connected via a single step beyond the current head.

So for example:

- If I choose to move LEFT from (5,5), new_head = (4,5). Since there are no other segments, it's safe.
- Similarly, moving UP to (5,6): safe.
- Moving RIGHT: (6,5) → safe.
- Moving DOWN: (5,4) → safe.

So in this case, all directions seem okay without worrying about collisions because the rest of the body has been removed or shifted out.

Therefore, from (5,5), any direction is allowed, and moving in a particular direction would shift the new_head to that cell. Then, in subsequent moves, you can choose other directions again.

But then, how do we reach (4,9)? Since y=9 is higher than 5, perhaps moving UP multiple times could get us there.

Wait, but if each move only shifts the head, moving UP from (5,5) to (5,6), then up again to (5,7), and so on. That would take a long time without getting closer to y=9.

Alternatively, perhaps after some moves LEFT or DOWN, we can combine both directions.

Wait, but if all other body segments have been shifted out of view, maybe moving in different directions could result in the snake taking various paths.

But this is becoming too vague. Maybe I should consider that any direction from (5,5) is safe because the rest has been removed or shifted out. So perhaps we can move freely and just try to reach (4,9).

From (5,5), moving UP to (5,6); then, perhaps moving LEFT to (4,6). From there, moving DOWN again would take us back down.

Alternatively, from (4,6), moving UP to (4,7). Hmm, this seems not helpful either.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in the snake's state after each move, only one cell is affected. So for example:

- Initial state: [(5,5)]
- After LEFT: [(4,5)] with body removed except new_head.
- After UP: [(5,6)] with body shifted out.
- From (4,6), we can move UP again to (4,7).

But this seems to be moving in the same direction repeatedly, which isn't helpful for reaching y=9.

Alternatively, perhaps after some LEFT and UP moves, I could start moving DOWN or something else. But since all other body segments have been shifted out of view, it might not help.

Wait a minute—maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Perhaps each segment in the list beyond the head represents another part of the snake that's connected by one step to the current head.

So for example:

If the list is [(5,5), (4,5)], meaning the head is at (5,5) and the tail is at (4,5). Then moving LEFT from (5,5) would take us to (4,5), which was previously the tail. Is that a problem?

Because if (4,5) is part of the list beyond the head, then perhaps that's another segment connected by one step.

So in this case:

- Moving LEFT: new_head = (4,5). The rest of the body would be removed or shifted out because (4,5) was previously the tail.
  
Similarly, moving UP from (5,5) to (5,6), which is beyond the list. So no collision.

Moving RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5): this would affect any segments beyond the new_head in the list? No, because after moving RIGHT, only the new_head changes; the rest are removed or shifted out.

Wait, perhaps each segment in the list is a separate part of the snake. So for example:

- The head is at (5,5).
- The next segment is at (4,5) [tail].
- Then another segment at (3,5), and so on.

So moving LEFT from (5,5) would shift the tail further to (4,5). But since this is in line with a previous position of the head or tail?

Wait, maybe each movement from the list beyond the current_head affects the next segment. So if you move LEFT, it might affect the segment that was at (4,5), which is connected by one step.

But I'm getting confused without knowing exactly how the body cells are arranged.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler than that: since the body is given as [(x1,y1), ..., (xn,yn)], each subsequent point is one step away from the previous. So for example:

- The head is at (5,5).
- The tail is at (4,5) [assuming a rightward direction].
  
In this case, moving LEFT would take us to (3,5). But if there's another segment beyond that?

Wait, I think without knowing the exact structure of the body cells beyond the head, it's hard to proceed.

Perhaps an alternative approach is needed. Let's consider each possible move and see how the snake can progress towards (4,9) while avoiding collisions.

Given that from any position, moving in directions LEFT, UP, RIGHT, or DOWN may be possible, except when another segment is present.

But considering the list being empty, maybe all moves are safe? So perhaps moving any direction first would just shift the new_head to that cell and make it a safe starting point for future movements.

Therefore, from (5,5), choosing any of the four directions seems acceptable. Let's try:

Option 1: Move LEFT → (4,5). From here, choose another direction.

From (4,5), possible moves are LEFT, UP, RIGHT, DOWN.

But let's see where each leads:

- Moving LEFT to (3,5)
- Moving UP to (4,6)
- Moving RIGHT to (5,5) [already at the starting point]
- Moving DOWN to (4,4)

Each of these seems like a new position. From there, we can choose again.

This approach might take many moves and could lead us away from (4,9). So perhaps this isn't the best path.

Option 2: Instead of choosing LEFT first, let's try moving UP.

From (5,5) → (5,6). Then, in the next move:

- Moving DOWN to (5,7)
- Moving UP again, but that would go further down
- Moving LEFT to (4,6)

Again, this seems like a linear path upwards without getting closer to y=9.

Alternatively, from (5,5) → UP → (5,6). Then moving LEFT to (4,6), which is on the same row as the target. From there:

- Moving DOWN to (4,7)
- Moving DOWN again to (4,8)
- Moving DOWN further to (4,9)

Wait! That could work.

Let me detail this step-by-step:

1. Initial state: [(5,5)]
2. Move UP → (5,6). Now, body is shifted out of view, so only new_head at (5,6).
3. From (5,6), move LEFT to (4,6). Body removed except for new_head.
4. From (4,6), move DOWN to (4,7). The rest are removed or shifted out.
5. From (4,7), move DOWN again to (4,8).
6. From (4,8), move DOWN once more to (4,9).

But wait! Each movement only affects the new_head and removes other body cells. So from (4,8), moving DOWN would take us to (4,9). That's exactly where we need to go!

So this path seems possible:

- Start at (5,5)
- Move UP → (5,6)
- Move LEFT → (4,6)
- Move DOWN three times: (4,7) → (4,8) → (4,9)

This path reaches the apple without any collisions or traps.

Wait, but is this allowed?

Each move only shifts the new_head and removes other body cells. So if we have multiple segments beyond the current head, moving in different directions could lead to taking various paths.

But in this case, since all other body cells are shifted out of view after each move, perhaps it's okay to keep moving in the same direction until y=9 is reached.

Therefore, seems like a possible path. But let me double-check if any collisions occur during these moves.

From (5,5):

1. Move UP: new_head is (5,6). No collision because only shifted out.
2. From (5,6), moving LEFT to (4,6): no collision since (4,5) was the previous tail, but moving to (4,6).
3. From (4,6), moving DOWN three times:

- First move: from (4,6) → (4,7)
- Second move: from (4,7) → (4,8)
- Third move: from (4,8) → (4,9)

Each time shifting the new_head and removing other body cells. No collision occurs because each step only affects one cell at a time.

So this path seems safe and effective.

Therefore, it's possible to reach (4,9). So yes, moving UP first then LEFT, then DOWN three times would get us there without any problems.

But wait—is that the minimal number of moves? Maybe not. Let me see if another path is shorter or more efficient.

Alternatively, what about:

1. Start at (5,5)
2. Move RIGHT → (6,5)
3. From (6,5), move UP three times:
   - (6,6) → (6,7) → (6,8) → (6,9)

That would also reach (4,9). But wait—would that path be shorter? It's 1 + 3 = 4 moves.

But the previous path was:

1. Up
2. LEFT
3. DOWN
4. DOWN

Which is also 4 moves. So both are similar in length but use different directions.

Alternatively, another path could involve moving RIGHT first:

1. (5,5) → RIGHT to (6,5)
2. From there, move UP three times as above.

But I think the key idea is that from each position, moving in a direction can shift the new_head and remove other body cells safely.

Hence, it's possible to reach (4,9).

Wait, but does the snake have multiple segments or only one?

If it has only one segment beyond the head, then any move would just affect the tail. So for example:

- If the list is [(5,5), (4,5)], meaning two cells in a line.

In this case, moving LEFT from (5,5) takes us to (3,5). But since there's another cell beyond (4,5), which is at (2,5), etc., if we move LEFT multiple times, each time removing the tail further away. Is that possible?

Wait, but in such a case:

1. Initial state: [(5,5)]
2. Move LEFT to (3,5)
   - Now, body is removed except for new_head at (3,5). The original head was at (5,5), and the tail would be shifted out of view.
3. From (3,5), move UP to (3,6)
4. Then moving LEFT or UP again.

But this seems messy because each segment beyond the head is connected by a single step.

Wait, maybe in such a case, the snake can only turn at certain points based on its segments.

Alternatively, perhaps it's necessary for all body cells beyond the head to be aligned in a straight line. If they are not, then moving left would disrupt the rest of the body.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is assuming that all body segments beyond the head are colinear and connected by single steps.

In that case, starting at (5,5), if each segment extends back one step:

- Head: (5,5)
- Tail: (4,5)

So moving LEFT from (5,5) would take us to (3,5). But since the tail is at (4,5), moving to (3,5) would leave a gap. Hmm, maybe that's not allowed.

Wait, perhaps if each segment beyond the head is directly connected by one step, meaning:

- From (5,5), you can move LEFT or UP to reach (4,5).

But in such a case, from (4,5), moving LEFT would take us out of bounds. Wait, maybe that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps all body cells are on the same line. So if each subsequent cell is one step back, then:

- (5,5) → (4,5) [tail]

So only two segments: head and tail, both at (5,5) and (4,5). Then moving in other directions would be blocked.

In that case, the snake can't move LEFT or UP from (5,5), because it's already on a line with the tail. So all moves beyond (5,5) must remain within this single straight line.

But in reality, this may not align with the problem description, which mentions multiple body segments as [(x1,y1),(x2,y2)...]. So perhaps each segment is a separate part, connected by one step.

In that case, from (5,5), moving LEFT would take us to (3,5), but since there's another cell at (4,5) as the tail, moving to (3,5) would mean skipping over it. Hence, no collision? Or does it still result in a collision?

Wait, let me think. If each segment is one step beyond the previous, then:

- The head is at (5,5)
- The next segment is at (4,5)
  
So moving LEFT from (5,5) would take us to (3,5), but that's skipping over (4,5). Since (4,5) was originally part of the tail, which was one step behind the head. Moving to (3,5) skips this cell, so no collision occurs.

Similarly, moving UP from (5,5) would take us to (5,6), which is beyond the original position but not interfering with any other cells.

So in that case, each move only affects a single new_head and removes the rest of the body. Therefore, even if you have multiple segments, each move doesn't interfere with others as long as they are shifted out.

Therefore, perhaps moving in different directions is possible without collision.

But then in this case, from (5,5), any direction is acceptable because all other cells are removed or shifted out after the first move.

So, to reach (4,9):

From (5,5) → UP to (5,6)

Then LEFT to (4,6)

Then DOWN three times: (4,7), (4,8), (4,9).

Each of these moves only shifts the new_head and removes other body cells. Therefore, no collision occurs.

Therefore, it's possible for the snake to reach (4,9) in 1 + 3 = 4 moves.

But wait—each move after shifting the head is considered moving forward in some direction. So maybe another path is more efficient or requires different steps.

Alternatively, perhaps starting with a LEFT first:

From (5,5):

1. Move LEFT to (4,5). Now, only new_head is at (4,5)
2. From there, move UP three times: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)
3. From (4,8), move DOWN once to (4,9)

That's 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 moves.

But the other path was 4 moves: UP, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN.

So which is better? The first one seems shorter.

Wait, in this case:

- First move: UP to (5,6)
- Second move: LEFT to (4,6)
- Third move: DOWN three times to (4,9)

That's 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 moves. Alternatively, the other path is 4 moves.

So perhaps the first path is better because it doesn't require moving back towards the tail again after shifting the head.

But regardless, both paths reach (4,9) without any collisions or traps.

Therefore, it's possible for a snake to reach (4,9). Thus, the answer is yes, and one such path is:

Start at (5,5), move UP to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), then DOWN three times: (4,7) → (4,8) → (4,9).

Therefore, I can conclude that it's possible for the snake to reach (4,9) with four moves.

But wait—each move shifts the new_head and removes other body cells. So each time after moving, you have only one cell active as the head or body. Therefore, no collision occurs because all other segments are either shifted out or removed.

Hence, this path is safe.

Another possible path:

1. Move LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5)
2. Then move UP three times: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8)
3. Then move DOWN once to (4,9)

This also works without any collisions or traps.

Therefore, yes, it's possible for the snake to reach (4,9).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(4, 9)}
</think>

The problem involves determining if a snake can reach the point \((4, 9)\) given specific movement constraints. The initial position of the snake is at \((5, 5)\). 

Key steps and reasoning:

1. **Movement Analysis**:
   - From any cell \((x, y)\), the snake can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.
   - If the snake moves towards a direction that would cause it to skip over another segment (e.g., moving LEFT from \((5, 5)\) to \((4, 5)\)), this is acceptable as other segments are shifted out of view.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - Starting at \((5, 5)\), the snake can move UP to \((5, 6)\).
   - From \((5, 6)\), moving LEFT to \((4, 6)\).
   - From \((4, 6)\), three moves DOWN: 
     - First move from \((4, 6)\) to \((4, 7)\).
     - Second move from \((4, 7)\) to \((4, 8)\).
     - Third move from \((4, 8)\) to \((4, 9)\).

This path ensures that the snake does not collide with any other segments or cells. The final position reached is \((4, 9)\).

### Final Answer
\boxed{(4, 9)}
