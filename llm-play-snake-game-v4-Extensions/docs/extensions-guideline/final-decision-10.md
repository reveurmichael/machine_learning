# Final Decision 10: GOOD_RULES System and Documentation Governance

> **SUPREME AUTHORITY**: This document establishes the definitive governance system for all documentation in the Snake Game AI project.

## üéØ **SUPREME_RULES: Ultimate Authority**

SUPREME_RULES represent the **ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY** for the entire project - they are like the SUPREME COURT + PRESIDENT + CONGRESS + SENATE + HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES + PREMIER MINISTER + SECRETARY OF STATE + ALL 50 GOVERNORS + ALL CABINET SECRETARIES + ALL MINISTERS + PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS + LEADERS OF ALL RELIGIONS + COMMANDER OF THE UNIVERSE + GENESIS OF BIG BANG OF THE PROJECT, and have the **FINAL SAY ON EVERYTHING**.

### **SUPREME_RULES Hierarchy**
1. **SUPREME_RULE NO.1**: When updating markdown files in `./docs/extensions-guideline/`, make sure to read ALL markdown files in `./docs/extensions-guideline/` first.
2. **SUPREME_RULE NO.2**: When citing Final Decision documents, use the precise format `final-decision-N.md`; Don't use "Final Decision N", "FD-N", or "final-decision-N".
3. **SUPREME_RULE NO.3**: We should be able to add new extensions easily and try out new ideas. Therefore, code in the "extensions/common/" folder should NOT be too restrictive.

## üìã **GOOD_RULES: Authoritative References**

The following files in `./docs/extensions-guideline/` are designated as **GOOD_RULES** and serve as the **single source of truth**:

- `agents.md` (Agent implementation standards)
- `ai-friendly.md` (AI assistant integration guidelines)
- `app.md` (Streamlit application architecture)
- `config.md` (Configuration architecture)
- `coordinate-system.md` (Universal coordinate system)
- `core.md` (Base class architecture)
- `csv-schema-1.md` and `csv-schema-2.md` (Data format specifications)
- `cwd-and-logs.md` (Working directory standards)
- `dashboard.md` (Dashboard component standards)
- `data-format-decision-guide.md` (Format selection criteria)
- `datasets-folder.md` (Directory structure standards)
- `documentation-as-first-class-citizen.md` (Documentation standards)
- `elegance.md` (Code quality standards)
- `extensions-move-guidelines.md` (Extension development workflow)
- `extensions-v0.01.md` through `extensions-v0.04.md` (Extension evolution guidelines)
- `final-decision-0.md` through `final-decision-10.md` (Complete Final Decision Series)
- `flask.md`
- `Grid-Size-Directory-Structure-Compliance-Report.md` (Compliance validation)
- `heuristics-as-foundation.md` (Heuristics extension standards)
- `models.md` (Model management standards)
- `naming_conventions.md` (Naming standards)
- `project-structure-plan.md` (Master architectural blueprint)
- `reinforcement-learning.md` (RL extension standards)
- `single-source-of-truth.md` (Architectural principles)
- `standalone.md` (Standalone principle enforcement)
- `supervised.md` (Supervised learning extension standards)
- `unified-factory-pattern-guide.md` (Factory pattern implementation)

- `unified-streamlit-architecture-guide.md` (Streamlit OOP architecture)
- `vision-language-model.md` (VLM extension standards)

## üö´ **Documentation Governance Rules**

### **Modification Restrictions**
- **GOOD_RULES**: Cannot be modified without explicit authorization
- **System-Prompt.md**: Important but not as authoritative as GOOD_RULES
- **Other .md files**: Less important than GOOD_RULES, can be updated for consistency

### **Conflict Resolution**
When conflicts arise between documentation files:
1. **GOOD_RULES** always take precedence
2. **System-Prompt.md** is secondary authority
3. **Other .md files** must align with GOOD_RULES
4. Flag inconsistencies with TODO comments if resolution is unclear
5. Apply obvious fixes directly when resolution is self-evident

## üéØ **TASK_DESCRIPTION_GOOD_RULES: Documentation Consistency Mandate**

### **Primary Objective**
Update all non-GOOD_RULES markdown files in `./docs/extensions-guideline/` to achieve:
- **Coherence**: Eliminate contradictions with GOOD_RULES
- **Elegance**: Concise, clear documentation (target 300-500 lines)
- **Consistency**: Unified terminology and architectural concepts
- **Educational Value**: Focus on motivation, design philosophy, and interconnections

### **Content Guidelines**
- **Minimal or Code**: Include only essential code examples for clarity. However, we can have exceptions for including longer code into those md files if necessary.
- **Rich Context**: Emphasize motivation, design philosophy, and concept interconnections
- **Concise Format**: Target 300 lines for simple topics, 500 lines for complex topics
- **Design Patterns**: Explain why patterns are chosen and their trade-offs

### **Resolution Approach**
For inconsistencies and ambiguities:
- **Obvious Solutions**: Apply fixes directly without TODO markers
- **Complex Issues**: Document with explanatory notes (e.g., `> **Note:** Section X requires further clarification`)
- **Preserve Intent**: Maintain educational value while ensuring technical accuracy

### **Quality Standards**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept has one authoritative explanation
- **Cross-References**: Link related concepts appropriately
- **Educational Focus**: Prioritize learning value over exhaustive detail
- **Architectural Coherence**: Ensure all files support the overall system design

## üîç **Implementation Process**

### **Analysis Phase**
1. VITAL: Read all markdown files in `./docs/extensions-guideline/`
2. Identify contradictions with GOOD_RULES
3. Catalog inconsistencies in terminology and concepts
4. Assess alignment with project objectives

### **Resolution Phase**
1. Update non-GOOD_RULES files for consistency
2. Eliminate redundancy while preserving unique insights
3. Standardize terminology and architectural references
4. Enhance educational value and clarity

### **Validation Phase**
1. Ensure all files support GOOD_RULES architecture
2. Verify elimination of contradictions
3. Confirm improved coherence and elegance
4. Validate educational progression and clarity

**This governance system ensures that the Snake Game AI project maintains architectural integrity, educational value, and technical excellence through systematic documentation management and conflict resolution.**
