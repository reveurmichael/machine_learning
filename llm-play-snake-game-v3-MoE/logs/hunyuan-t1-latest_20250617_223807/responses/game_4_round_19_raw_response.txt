"reasoning": "The snake starts at (9,0) with a body blocking upward movement along x=9. The first move must be LEFT to (8,0) to avoid collision. From there, moving UP along x=8 avoids the body (which shifts downward as the snake moves). After reaching (8,9), moving LEFT navigates around the body's leftmost segments (which are below y=9) to reach the apple at (3,9). This path ensures no collisions with walls or body segments and leaves space to move after eating the apple."
