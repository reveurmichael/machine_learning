## NO MVC

No MVC for version 4. 

It will be there for version 5. 

## Scripts folder

Unifying the main.py and main_web.py mode (with OOP, already some first success), then replay.py and replay_web.py mode with OOP. Then human play pygame mode and web mode.

Web mode needs a lot of work to do for reducing code redundancy.



Main mode (PyGame) is working 100% OK now.



## Heuristics, at least no gui mode, is totally great now. Don't modify it - Yet.
