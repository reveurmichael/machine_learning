========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I need to help plan a path for the snake from (5,5) towards the apple at (7,7). The initial direction is "NONE", so the first move can be any of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But since we're starting without a body behind except the head, moving in certain directions might make it easier.

First, let's see where the apple is. It's two cells to the right and two cells up from the head. So, I need to move towards that direction. Maybe start by moving RIGHT twice and UP twice, but I have to ensure that each step doesn't cause a collision with the body or itself.

The snake is just at (5,5), no body behind except for itself if it moves into cells occupied by previous body segments. But since initially, the body list is empty, so when moving RIGHT first, the new head will be (6,5). Then the body becomes [(6,5)], but wait—no, because after the first move, we add the old head to the front of the body and remove the tail if necessary.

Wait, actually in the initial case where the snake has no body segments (body list is empty), moving RIGHT would result in inserting the new_head at the front of an empty body. So the body becomes [new_head], which is just the new head without any tail to remove. But this might complicate things because then the next move could cause issues.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to first move UP twice and then RIGHT. Let me map out possible moves step by step.

Starting at (5,5), direction NONE.
First move options: Up, Down, Left, Right.

If I move Right once:
New head is (6,5). Since the body list is empty, after inserting (6,5) at front and no tail removal because it's not eating an apple. So now S becomes [(6,5)]. Next move direction can be anything except opposite to current (since none was moved before).

Wait, but in movement rules, if current direction is NONE, any first move is allowed. But after that, next directions cannot reverse.

So perhaps moving Right twice and Up twice would make sense without reversing.

Alternatively, maybe it's safer to start by moving UP then RIGHT multiple times.

But I need to ensure each step doesn't cause the head to collide with itself or the body (which initially is empty).

Wait a second—since the body list is empty, when we move for the first time, the new_head is added to the front of an empty list. Then, since no apple is eaten, the tail is removed if any. But in this case, since it's the first move and the snake can't be moving into a cell that will become the tail.

Wait, according to movement update rules:

After computing new_head:
- If new_head is invalid (outside grid or colliding with body except for when growing apple), then die.
Else:
- Insert old head at front of body list.
- Remove last element if not eating apple.

But initially, body is empty. So after moving Right once:
new_head = (6,5).
Insert (6,5) into front of empty body → new S is [(6,5)].
Since no apple eaten, remove tail (which doesn't exist), so now body remains as [6,5].

Wait, that's not right. Because the movement update rule says:
If new_head is inside grid and not on any bodyi except when growing.

But in this case, since there's no body yet, moving to a new cell is fine.

Next move: after first Right, the snake has head at (6,5). Now next direction could be Right again. Let me see:

Compute new_head = 7,5.
Check if it's valid and not colliding with any body cells except when growing apple.

Since the body only has (6,5) as head now, moving to (7,5) is okay because no collision yet. Then update body: insert old head (6,5) at front → new S = [(7,5), (6,5)]. Since it's not eating an apple, remove last element. So the snake becomes just [7,5]. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait no—the movement step is to insert the old head into the front of the body list and then remove the tail if not eating apple. So after moving Right again:

new_head = (7,5). Body before was [(6,5)]. Insert 6,5 at front → [6,5, ...]. Then since no apple eaten, we have to remove last element. But wait, in this step, when the snake moves, it's inserting into an empty list or not?

Wait initial state after first move: body is [(6,5)].

Second move: direction RIGHT again.
new_head = (7,5).
Check if valid and not on any body cells except tail moving. Since body is [(6,5)], new_head isn't in there yet. So no collision.

Update body:
Insert old head (6,5) at front → new body becomes [ (6,5), ... ].
Then since we're eating nothing, remove last element of the original body ([6,5]). Wait, but originally, after first move, body is [(6,5)] and then in second step, after inserting 6,5 to become [(6,5)], then removing tail. So now it's empty? No.

Wait no: when moving from S = [ (6,5) ]:

new_head is computed as (7,5). Since the body list before movement was [ (6,5) ].

Insert old head at front → new body becomes [(6,5), ...]. Wait, but after inserting, then if not eating apple, remove last element. So original body had one element: (6,5).

After moving to (7,5), insert 6,5 in front of the existing body list, making it [6,5], and since we're not eating an apple, remove the tail.

Wait but after inserting, the new body is [(6,5)] added before any others. Then when removing last element, which is (6,5), so now body becomes empty except for the inserted head? No—that's getting confusing.

Maybe it's better to model this step by step:

Initial S: [ (5,5) ] → since no body.

Move RIGHT once:
new_head = (6,5)
Insert into front of empty list: new_body is [ (6,5) ]
Since not eating apple, remove tail (nothing), so body remains [6,5].

Now move RIGHT again:

new_head = 7,5
Check if valid and no collision with current body [(6,5)] → yes.
Insert old head (6,5) into front of current body: new_body becomes [ (6,5), ... ].

Wait but the existing body is [(6,5)], so inserting gives [(6,5), 6,5]?

No—wait: initial movement when moving RIGHT again:

After first move: S = [ (6,5) ]

Second move: direction RIGHT.
Compute new_head = (7,5).

Check collision: no.

Insert old head into front of body → which was [ (6,5) ] → now becomes [(6,5), ...]. But since we're not eating apple, remove last element. So after inserting, the list is [(6,5)] + new_head? Or does it just insert and then shift?

Wait no: in movement update rules:

After computing new_head:

a. Insert old head at front → so if previous body was [ (6,5) ], now after insertion, it's [ (6,5), ... ].

But wait the old head is (6,5). So inserting into front of the previous body gives a list like [(6,5)] + ... no. Wait: the movement rule says insert the old head at front, so if the previous body was [B1], then new_body after insertion is [old_head, B1].

Then:

b. If not eating apple → remove last element.

So moving to (7,5):

new_head = 7,5
insert into front of current body [(6,5)] → new_body before tail removal becomes [ (7,5), (6,5) ] ?

Wait no: in the movement update rules:

Step 1: Compute new_head.

Step 2: Check collision with previous body except when growing apple.

Assuming no collision.

Step 3a: Insert old head at front of current body. So if the current body was [ (6,5) ], after insertion it's [ (7,5), ... ]? No—old head is the previous head before moving, which was (6,5).

Wait perhaps I'm getting confused with the steps.

Let me restate:

The movement step is as follows:
1. Compute new_head.
2. Check for collision in old state (before any body shifts).
3. Update body: insert old head at front of current body list.
4. If not eating apple, remove last element of body list.
5. Set HEAD = new_head.

So in the first move:

- Body was empty → after moving to 6,5:
   - Insert (6,5) into empty → body becomes [6,5]
   - No removal as no apple eaten
   - HEAD is now 6,5

Second move: direction RIGHT again.
Compute new_head =7,5.

Check collision with current body which was [(6,5)] → no.

Update body:
a. Insert old head (6,5) at front of [6,5] → body becomes [6,5, 6,5]? Wait that can't be right because the snake's body should have a continuous path.

Wait actually, after first move:

S = [6,5].

Second move: compute new_head=7,5. It is valid and not in current body except if it's tail moving (which it isn't). So no collision.

Now update body:
a. Insert old head (6,5) at front → so the body becomes [(6,5), ... ].
   But wait, the previous body was [ (6,5) ], now after insertion in step 3a: new_body is [old_head] + current_body?

Wait no—current_body before movement is [(6,5)]. After inserting old head at front, which is also (6,5), it becomes [ (6,5) ] → but wait that's the same as before.

No, in reality:

Original body: after first move, S was just 6,5. So when we move again, new_head=7,5.

Then:
a. Insert old head into front of body list. The current_body is [(6,5)], so inserting (6,5) at front → [6,5] + previous_body? Or the movement rule says insert to make a new body where it's inserted in front, and then tail is removed.

Wait perhaps this is the confusion: When you have an existing body list, after moving:

new_body = [old_head] followed by current_body. Then if not eating apple, remove last element of new_body.

So first movement:
Old head was (5,5). Body was empty. After inserting at front → [(6,5)]. Since no tail removal.

Second movement: old head is 6,5.
Insert into front of [6,5] gives [6,5,6,5]? That can't be right because the snake's body would have duplicate cells which isn't allowed.

Wait that must mean I'm misunderstanding how step 3a works. Maybe it inserts to form a new list where you add the old head at front of current_body before any removals, regardless of whether we're removing or not.

So:

After inserting: if no apple eaten:
new_body = [old_head] + previous_body

Then remove last element only if eating apple.

Wait that would make more sense. So for first movement:

previous_body is empty → new_body becomes [6,5], no removal.

Second movement:

previous_body was [(6,5)].
new_body after insertion: [ (6,5) ] + previous_body = [6,5, 6,5]. But that's invalid because each cell should be unique. So actually, this approach is wrong.

Wait maybe step 3a is inserting into a new body list which starts as the old_head followed by current_body, but then in step 4 you either remove last element or not based on whether it's an apple movement.

So after first movement:
S = [6,5].

Second movement:

new_head=7,5.
Check no collision with S before update (which is [6,5]).

Update body: new_body = [old_head] + current_body → old_head was 6,5. So new_body becomes [6,5, 6,5], which isn't possible because the snake can't have duplicate cells in its body except for when it's growing into itself?

But that would cause duplication.

This suggests an error in my understanding of how step 3a works.

Perhaps a better way to model this is:

When moving forward:
1. Compute new_head.
2. Check if valid and not colliding with any current_body cells (excluding the last one if apple is eaten).
   - For initial steps, since body is empty except for head after first move.
3. If movement is valid, create a temporary_new_body by inserting old_head at front of current_body list → this will cause new_body to have duplicate head unless handled.

Wait perhaps each step when the snake grows (apple eaten), it adds the new_head and doesn't remove anything else except the tail beyond that.

But in our case, since we're not eating apple initially, moving would just add a cell at front without removing any—except if body is too long. But actually, for movement steps:

After step 3a: insert old head into front of current_body to create new_body_temp = [old_head] + current_body.

Then in step 4:
If eating apple → keep all cells except remove tail beyond.
Else → set S as new_body_temp minus last element.

Wait no—the movement update rules say:

Step 3a: Insert old head at front of body list to form new_body before any possible removals.

So if after insertion, the snake is longer than it was before, step 4b says to remove tail unless growing apple. So for non-apple steps, S becomes [new_head] + current_body minus last element (so effectively inserting but then removing one to keep same length).

Wait now that's making sense.

So in initial state:

S = [(5,5)].
Body is empty except the head because when moving first time you insert into an empty list. Wait no—the movement step says:
a) Insert old_head at front of current body → if current body is empty (before any steps), then new_body becomes [old_head], but without removing anything since it's not eating apple.

Wait, that would mean initial move leads to S = [(6,5)] with length 1. Then next step:

new_head=7,5.
Insert into front of [6,5] → new_body before removal is [(6,5), (7,5)], but then since no apple eaten and the snake's body was only one cell, does it now become two cells? So S would be length 2.

But that seems to cause a problem because next movement could require the snake to have enough space without overlapping itself.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps in the first move, after inserting into empty list and not removing tail (since no apple), the new S becomes [6,5] with length 1 as before? Because if you insert into an empty body, you're adding to a position beyond what was there.

This is getting too tangled without proper rules. Maybe I should think differently: since the snake can't have overlapping cells except when growing into itself (which isn't allowed), each move must ensure that new_head doesn't land on any existing body cell except for maybe being followed by another step where it's moving into a collision.

But perhaps, given the initial state with no body except head, moving to 6,5 is okay. Then moving to 7,5: check if that cell was previously occupied (it wasn't), so inserting at front would make S = [7,5,6,5], but that's impossible because the snake can't have two heads.

Wait now I'm confused about whether the body list represents all cells except head or just the tail. Looking back:

Rule 3 says:
The movement update rules:

a) Insert the old head into a new position in front of the current body.

b) Remove the last element only if not eating an apple and when adding the new_head doesn't cause collision with existing body beyond that point.

Wait maybe I should model it as S = [old head] + current_body, but then after insertion, remove tail except for apple case.

In that case:

First move:
S was empty → insert 6,5. So S becomes [(6,5)].

Second move: compute new_head=7,5.
Check collision with S's body (which is [6,5])? No.
Insert old head into front of current_body → so S after insertion is [7,5,6,5].
Since not eating apple, remove tail → back to [(7,5)].

So now S is just the new_head. So each time you move, snake's body becomes a single cell. But that can't be right because when moving again in some directions it would cause collision with itself.

Wait perhaps this suggests that movement only allows adding one cell and then immediately removing another, so effectively keeping the snake length same as before? That seems inefficient for growth towards apple.

But given initial no body (except head), each move adds a new head but removes the tail unless growing into self. So in first few steps:

Move RIGHT:
S = [6,5] → single cell.
Next Move RIGHT again: compute 7,5 → check collision with S's current_body ([6,5])? No.

Insert old_head (6,5) at front of current_body to get [6,5] + [6,5]? But that would have duplicates. So this must be wrong.

Wait I think my understanding is incorrect because the initial step is adding a new cell without a body beyond it until an apple is eaten. Each movement effectively adds one cell and removes another only if necessary.

But since in first steps, there's no body to collide with except when moving into itself or after growing.

This seems too complex for now; perhaps I should switch approach: find a path towards the apple that doesn't cause immediate collision, focusing on getting closer each step without reversing direction unless necessary.

Given that:

- The snake starts at (5,5).
- Apple is at (7,7).

The minimal number of steps would be moving right twice and up twice. But need to ensure no collision with self.

But wait if we move RIGHT twice first: from 5,5 →6,5→7,5; then UP twice: but body was only in front direction—so when moving Up next step after Right, let's see:

Move RIGHT:
S = [6,5]

Next Move RIGHT again (now facing right, can't move left as per rule if previous direction is NONE or same).
Wait no—if first move is RIGHT and the current direction is set to RIGHT. Next direction must be either RIGHT or straight ahead—probably not applicable.

Wait rules don't specify what's allowed in terms of movement after a certain direction except that you cannot reverse unless necessary, but since initial movement can be any direction when starting with head.

Perhaps this is more about finding an unobstructed path while growing the snake towards the apple without self-collisions. So perhaps moving up twice then right twice would work.

Wait let's map it out:

Current position: (5,5)
After move UP → (5,6) → body becomes [5,6]
Next move UP again → (5,7), but that's above the apple at 7,7. Wait no—apples are at (7,7). So moving to (5,7).

But from current position (5,7): next step can we move right? Let's see.

Move RIGHT twice would take us to (7,7) which is where the apple is located. But need to make sure that each step doesn't cause collision with body.

Wait let me try:

1st Move: UP → from 5,5→5,6; S = [5,6]
2nd Move: UP again →5,7; check if (5,7) collides with previous body? Previous was just [5,6], so no collision. So now S becomes [5,7].
But wait—movement update rules require inserting the old head into front of current_body and then removing tail unless apple is eaten.

So after first UP:
- new_head= (4,6) if moving up from 5,5? No—that's not right.
Wait initial position is 5,5. Moving Up would make it (5,6). So:

Old head was at (5,5). Inserting into front of current_body which is empty after the move—wait no.

I think I need to abandon trying to model each movement step and instead consider that from 5,5 moving towards up then right. Let's attempt path:

Step 1: Move Up → new position (4,6)
- Current S length? Maybe 2 now as it has to add a cell.
But not sure—without proper rules, hard to model.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal path is RRUU or similar, but without causing self-collisions. It might be necessary for the snake's body not to block itself when growing into the apple area.

Considering all this complexity, maybe it would take at least 4 moves (right twice and up twice), ensuring no collisions by carefully arranging turns.
</think>

The minimal path involves moving right twice and then up twice without self-collisions. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Move Right to (6,5)
2. Move Right again to (7,5) (now facing right can't reverse direction until necessary; assuming movement is adjusted accordingly)
3. Turn Up and move to (7,6)
4. Move Up again to (7,7)

Each step ensures the snake's head moves towards the apple without colliding with its own body.

Answer: \boxed{4}
