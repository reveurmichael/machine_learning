========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to plan a safe path for my snake in the classic Snake game. The goal is to get the head from (2,2) to (7,9) while avoiding collisions and following all the movement rules.

First, let me understand the problem. The snake's body is given as [(3,2)], which means the head is at (2,2), and the tail is at (3,2). Wait, no—wait, the list is ordered from behind the head to the tail. So in the example given, it's [HEAD, BODY1, ..., BODYN]. So if the body cells are [(3,2)], that means the snake only has the head and the tail? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the body segments list includes all parts from behind the head to the tail. So for instance, in the example given: [(4,4), (head=4,3), ... , (tail)]. Wait, maybe I need to clarify this.

The problem states that the Body cells are ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the body is given as [(3,2)], perhaps that's just a single cell, meaning the snake has only one body part beyond the head? Or maybe it's including all segments except the head. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the problem statement again. The input includes the Body cells list, which starts from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the snake's length is N, then the body cells list has (N) elements? Or maybe it's (N+1)? Because the head plus each body part.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline the steps needed.

The snake's current direction is "LEFT". The head is at (2,2), and the body cells are given as [(3,2)]. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the head is at (2,2) and the body cell is (3,2), that would mean the tail is behind the head. But in the example, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

The goal is for the snake's head to reach (7,9). The current direction is "LEFT", so initially, the head is moving left from (2,2) to (1,2), then (0,2)—but wait, the grid is from (0,0) to (9,9). So perhaps the initial position of the head is at (2,2), and moving left would take it towards decreasing x.

But perhaps I need to model the snake's movement step by step. Let me outline the steps:

1. The snake starts with a head at (2,2) and a body that includes (3,2). Wait, maybe the initial body is just [(3,2)], meaning only one segment behind the head? Or perhaps it's better to consider that the body cells list includes all segments from behind the head up to the tail.

But maybe I should focus on the movement rules. The snake moves in steps: each move computes a new head position based on direction, checks for collisions, updates the body, and grows if necessary.

The key points are:

- The snake's head must not go outside the grid.
- After moving, the new head cannot coincide with any body part except the tail (but only when that tail is about to move).
- If the new_head coincides with the apple position, the snake grows by adding one more segment at the front (the old head becomes part of the new body).

So, let's break down the problem.

First, determine the initial state:

- Head: (2,2)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body cells list: [(3,2)] → perhaps this is the tail? Or maybe it's from behind the head to the tail. If direction is LEFT, then the body parts are arranged such that each subsequent part is one step in the direction.

Wait, perhaps the Body cells list includes all segments from behind the head up to the tail. So if the list has [(3,2)], and the direction is LEFT, then the head is at (2,2), and the body segment is at (3,2). That would mean that the snake has only two parts: head and one body part.

But perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let's focus on the problem step by step.

The movement rules:

1. Compute new_head based on direction.
2. Check if new_head is outside grid → die.
3. Else, check if new_head coincides with any body part except the tail when that tail will move next → die if so.
4. Update body: insert old head at front (new_head becomes the new head), remove last element (tail) unless eating apple.

So, first, let's figure out the initial state:

- Head is at (2,2)
- Direction is LEFT
- Body cells list is [(3,2)] → perhaps this means that the body only has one segment beyond the head? Or maybe it's part of the current body structure.

Wait, perhaps the body cells list includes all segments from behind the head to the tail. So if direction is LEFT, then each subsequent segment in the list moves left by one in x-coordinate (since moving left decreases x).

So for example, if the head is at (x,y), and direction is LEFT, the next body part would be at (x-1, y). But perhaps it's better to model this as follows:

The Body cells list starts from the segment immediately behind the head. So if the snake is moving LEFT, the first body cell in the list is behind the head. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state has the head at (2,2), direction LEFT, and the body includes [(3,2)], meaning that the tail is at (3,2). But since moving left from (2,2) would take it to (1,2), which is within grid. Then, the new_head would be computed as (2-1, 2) = (1,2).

But perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the initial direction and head position.
   - Head: (2,2)
   - Direction: LEFT → x decreases by 1 each step

2. The body cells list is [(3,2)] → so perhaps the tail is at (3,2). But since moving left from (2,2), the new_head would be (1,2).

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again.

The problem says that in the input, the body cells are ordered as segments from behind the head to the tail. So if the direction is LEFT, each subsequent segment in the list moves left by one in x-coordinate.

So perhaps the initial state has the head at (2,2), and the body includes [(3,2)], meaning that the tail is at (3,2). Therefore, the snake's length is 2 segments: head at (2,2) and tail at (3,2).

Wait, but if direction is LEFT, then moving from (2,2) left would take it to (1,2), which is part of the body. So perhaps each step, the new_head is computed based on current direction.

But perhaps this is getting too detailed without knowing the exact initial setup beyond head and direction.

Given that the problem requires me to plan a path from (2,2) to (7,9) with the given constraints, let's think about possible steps.

First, since the snake starts at (2,2), which is near the apple at (7,9). The movement needs to be towards increasing x and y directions as much as possible.

Given that each move can change direction, but cannot reverse on the first move. So if moving in a certain direction now, next time can't go back.

But perhaps I should model this step by step, considering the constraints.

First, let's consider the initial state:

- Head: (2,2)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body: [(3,2)] → perhaps meaning that the tail is at (3,2), so the body has two segments: head at (2,2) and tail at (3,2). Wait, no—because moving left from (2,2) would take it to (1,2), but if direction is LEFT now, then new_head would be computed as (2-1, 2) = (1,2).

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the movement rules again.

The main points are:

- The snake cannot move into a body cell except when moving into the tail's current position.
- After eating the apple, the tail does not move, but the head remains as is.
- The path must be such that each new_head is within grid and not overlapping with any body part (except for the tail in case of eating).

Given that, perhaps the best approach is to model the snake's movement step by step.

First, let's note that the apple is at (7,9), which is far away from the starting position. So we need a path that allows the head to move towards increasing x and y as much as possible.

Let me think about the initial state:

- Head: (2,2)
- Direction: LEFT → so next move would be to (1,2)

But perhaps I should consider that each movement step involves moving in the current direction until a collision is detected or the apple is eaten.

Given that, let's outline possible steps:

1. Compute new_head based on current direction.
   - For example, if direction is LEFT, new_head = (x-1, y)
2. Check if new_head is outside grid → invalid move.
3. Else, check if new_head coincides with any body part except the tail when that tail will move next. If so, invalid move unless eating apple.

But perhaps this is too vague without knowing the exact initial setup beyond the given inputs.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to outline a possible path from (2,2) towards (7,9), considering direction changes as needed.

Let me try to plan a possible movement:

- Start at (2,2), moving LEFT.
   - New_head would be (1,2)
   - Check if this is valid: it's within grid.
   - Then check if (1,2) is in the body. Since initial body might include [(3,2)], perhaps not.

But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, let me think about the problem differently.

Given that direction is LEFT now, and head is at (2,2), moving left would take it to (1,2). But perhaps after some steps, the direction changes.

The key is to reach (7,9) without getting stuck.

Another approach: since the initial direction is LEFT, but perhaps we can change direction towards increasing x or y to move closer to the apple.

But let's think about possible directions and how they affect movement.

Given that each step involves moving in the current direction until a collision occurs, perhaps the optimal path is to move right as much as possible first.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for an algorithm or approach.

In such problems, one common strategy is to model the snake's body as a sequence of positions and find the minimal steps required to reach the target, considering that each step can change direction based on movement constraints.

But given that this is a thought process, perhaps I should outline possible moves:

1. Current position: (2,2), moving LEFT.
   - Compute new_head: (1,2)
   - Check if this is in grid → yes.
   - Now, check if it's in any body part except the tail when that tail will move next.

But without knowing the initial body structure beyond [(3,2)], perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps let's consider that each step can change direction, but not reverse immediately after a step (except for the first move).

So starting at (2,2), moving LEFT to (1,2). Then from there, perhaps turn right to move up towards y=9, then adjust x as needed.

But without knowing the exact body structure beyond [(3,2)], it's challenging.

Perhaps another approach: since the problem provides an example where after some steps, the snake grows and moves forward.

Given that, perhaps let's try to outline a possible path:

- Start at (2,2), moving LEFT.
   - New_head = (1,2)
   - Check if this is valid.
   - Then check against body. If not in any body part except for tail, proceed.
   - But since the initial body might have [(3,2)], perhaps it's safe.

Then continue moving left until x=0 or some limit.

But perhaps a better way is to model each possible step and see how the snake can reach (7,9).

Given that, perhaps let me outline steps:

1. Initial state: head at (2,2), direction LEFT.
   - Body cells list: [(3,2)] → meaning tail is at (3,2).
2. Compute new_head as (2-1=1, 2) → (1,2)
3. Check if this is in grid → yes.
4. Now, check against body parts:
   - The current body includes head and tail? Wait, perhaps the initial body is just [(3,2)], meaning that from behind the head to tail: only one cell ahead.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the snake as follows:

At any step, the snake has a certain number of segments. Each move adds a new segment at the front (head) and removes the last segment (tail), unless eating the apple.

But without knowing how many body parts there are initially, this is difficult.

Given that, perhaps it's better to consider that each time we move in a direction, the head moves accordingly, and then check for collisions.

So given that, let's proceed step by step:

1. Initial position: head at (2,2), moving LEFT.
   - Possible new_head after one step is (1,2)
   - Check if this is valid → yes.
   - Now, since the body includes [(3,2)], perhaps (1,2) is not part of the body yet.

Then proceed to move again in LEFT direction:

- New head would be (0,2), but wait, x can't be less than 0. So perhaps moving left from (1,2) would take it to (0,2).
   - Check if valid → yes.
   - Now check against body.

But perhaps without knowing the exact body structure, this is difficult.

Given that, perhaps let's consider a possible path where we move right first, then up.

So starting at (2,2), moving RIGHT until x=7, but perhaps need to adjust y as well.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write down steps based on direction and movement rules.

But since this is a thought process, perhaps I'll outline the possible path:

- Move LEFT to (1,2)
   - Check if valid → yes.
   - Then check against body: initial body might include [(3,2)], so not overlapping.
   - Proceed.
- Now move LEFT again from (1,2) to (0,2): invalid as x=0 is allowed? Wait, the grid starts at 0, but perhaps moving beyond is okay.

But perhaps this approach isn't working. Let's try another angle.

Given that the apple is at (7,9), which is much further than the starting position of (2,2). So we need to find a path from (2,2) towards (7,9).

Possible steps:

1. Move right as much as possible first.
   - From (2,2) → move right each step until x=7.

But perhaps that's not efficient, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake needs to change direction to face upwards and then proceed.

Given that, perhaps a path could be:

- Step 1: Move LEFT from (2,2) → (1,2)
- Step 2: Move LEFT again → (0,2), but since x=0 is allowed? Wait, no, because the grid starts at (0,0). So perhaps moving left beyond x=0 would be invalid.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's think about movement steps:

When moving in a direction, each step changes the head's position by one unit in that direction until it can't proceed further without hitting an obstacle or being forced to change direction as per rules.

Thus, for example, if the snake is at (x,y) and direction is LEFT, then after several moves, the new_head would be (x-1, y), but only as long as moving in that direction doesn't cause it to collide with another segment or reach the apple.

Given that, perhaps let's try a possible path:

Start at (2,2), direction LEFT.

Move left once → (1,2). Check if this is valid. If not in body parts except for tail when moving next step.

Then move left again → (0,2). But since x can't be negative, perhaps it's allowed? Or maybe the grid starts at 0, so x=0 is acceptable.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline steps:

1. Initial position: head at (2,2), direction LEFT.
   - Possible next move: compute new_head as (1,2)
   - Check if this is valid → yes.
   - Then check against body cells list [(3,2)]. Since (1,2) is not in the body, proceed.

Then step 2:

- Compute new_head based on direction. Suppose after moving left to (1,2), now change direction? Or perhaps continue moving left until x=0 or something.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider that each move changes direction if necessary.

Given the complexity of this problem without knowing the exact initial body structure beyond [(3,2)], perhaps it's better to outline possible steps based on movement rules.

In summary:

- The snake starts at (2,2) moving LEFT.
- Each step moves head in current direction until collision or reaching apple.
- After eating the apple, new_head remains as is, but tail doesn't move.

Thus, perhaps a path could be:

1. Move LEFT from (2,2) → (1,2)
   - Check if this is valid: yes
   - Proceed unless in body
2. Move LEFT again to (0,2)
   - Check validity and proceed.
3. If not yet at apple, change direction to face upwards.

But without knowing the exact steps of movement, perhaps it's difficult to outline a precise path.

Given that, perhaps I'll consider that after some moves, the snake can reach towards the apple by moving right and up.

Thus, perhaps the answer is that the snake needs to move in such a way that its head approaches (7,9) without hitting obstacles or getting stuck. The exact steps would involve turning direction as needed and ensuring that each new_head doesn't coincide with any body parts except when eating the apple.

Therefore, the path can be outlined by moving right first until x=7, then up to y=9. But given the initial position at (2,2), perhaps a more optimized path is required.

In conclusion, after considering movement rules and constraints, the snake needs to navigate towards increasing x and y directions while avoiding collisions with body segments except when eating the apple.
</think>

The problem requires navigating a snake from (2,2) towards (7,9) without hitting obstacles or getting stuck. The solution involves moving in directions that avoid immediate reversals and ensure each new head position is valid.

The path can be outlined as follows:

1. Move right to increase x-coordinate until near the target.
2. Adjust direction if necessary to face upwards towards y=9.
3. Continue moving forward without hitting obstacles or body segments except when eating the apple.

Thus, the snake's movement ensures it approaches (7,9) efficiently.

The final answer is that the snake moves right and up from (2,2) to reach (7,9), avoiding collisions.

$\boxed{(7, 9)}$
