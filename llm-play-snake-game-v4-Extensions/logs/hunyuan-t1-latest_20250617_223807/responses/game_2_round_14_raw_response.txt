========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The head starts at (3,0) and needs to reach (3,3). Moving UP three times directly approaches the apple. Each UP move is safe: (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) are not occupied by the snake's body in their respective steps. After reaching the apple, there are valid subsequent moves (e.g., RIGHT or LEFT) to avoid trapping."
