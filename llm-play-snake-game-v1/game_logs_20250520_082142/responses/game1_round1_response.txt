Let's analyze the current game state and plan a sequence of moves to reach the apple at (3, 7) from the snake head at (5, 5).

Current position: (5, 5)
Apple position: (3, 7)

The snake head has no current direction (just "H"), so we can choose any initial direction. The most efficient path would be to move upward while also moving right toward the apple. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. First move UP to (4, 5) - this starts vertical movement toward the apple's row
2. Then RIGHT to (4, 6) - begins horizontal movement toward the apple's column
3. UP to (3, 6) - continues vertical movement
4. RIGHT to (3, 7) - reaches the apple

However, this is only 4 moves, and you requested at least 5. We can add an extra move at the beginning to make it 5 moves while still maintaining an efficient path:

Here's the 5-move sequence:
1. RIGHT (to (5,6)) - starts moving toward the apple's column
2. UP (to (4,6)) - begins vertical movement
3. UP (to (3,6)) - continues upward
4. RIGHT (to (3,7)) - reaches the apple
5. (This move would be after eating the apple, so we can choose any safe direction) UP (to (2,7)) - continues upward to leave space for growth

Alternatively, if we want to ensure we have exactly the moves needed to reach the apple (4 moves) plus one extra, here's another 5-move sequence:
1. UP (to (4,5))
2. RIGHT (to (4,6))
3. UP (to (3,6))
4. RIGHT (to (3,7)) - eats apple
5. RIGHT (to (3,8)) - continues right after eating

Final decision (most efficient 5-move sequence that reaches the apple on move 4):
1. UP
2. RIGHT
3. UP
4. RIGHT
5. UP

This sequence:
- Moves the snake efficiently toward the apple
- Reaches the apple on the 4th move
- Has a safe 5th move (UP) to continue after eating
- Avoids any immediate collisions
- Follows all game rules
