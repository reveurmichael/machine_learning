========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 5 times to reduce the x-coordinate from 5 to 0, then up once to increase the y-coordinate from 7 to 8 (reaching the apple at (0,8)). Each left move avoids collisions with the body (initially positioned at x â‰¥5), and the final up move to (0,8) is safe as the apple position is not occupied by the body. After eating, the snake can legally move right or up next, avoiding entrapment."
