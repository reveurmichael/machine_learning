<think>
Okay, I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where I need to find a path for the snake to eat the apple without dying. The snake is at (7,6) and the apple is at (0,9). Let me break down what I know.

First, the snake's current direction is "RIGHT". So initially, it's moving towards higher x values. But since the apple is to the left of the head, moving right might not be the best idea because it takes the snake further away from the apple. I need to change direction, but there are movement rules I have to consider.

The problem says that on the first move, if the direction is "NONE", any direction can be chosen. But after that, reversing directions is only allowed if you don't reverse in a way that would trap the snake. For example, if I'm moving up, I can't immediately move down next because that might lead to a situation where there's no safe path.

Looking at the grid, (7,6) is near the bottom-right area. The apple is at (0,9), which is on the top row of the left side. So, to get there, the snake needs to move left and up. But it can't just turn around instantly because reversing directions isn't allowed unless it's the first move.

Wait, actually, if the current direction is "RIGHT", can I choose "LEFT" as the next move? The rules say that you cannot reverse unless it's the first move. So since the initial direction is "RIGHT", turning to "LEFT" would be reversing and might cause issues. But maybe after some moves, it's allowed.

I need to plan a path where the snake can navigate from (7,6) to (0,9) without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds. Also, when eating the apple, I must ensure that there's at least one move left for the next turn to avoid being trapped.

Let me think about possible paths. One approach is to first move up as much as possible because the apple is higher in y-coordinate. So moving "UP" would take the snake towards (7,7), then maybe continue upwards or change direction once it's safe.

Alternatively, since moving left is necessary to reach x=0, but I can't reverse right away, perhaps a detour is needed. Maybe move up first to clear some space, then move left, and then adjust directions accordingly.

I should also consider the body segments of the snake. The initial body cells are [(6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)]. So from (7,6), moving up would take it to (7,7). That's currently not occupied by any body part except for (5,7) and others, which are to the left.

If I move "UP" first, the head becomes (7,7). Then, check if that position is safe. Since there's no collision with body parts yet, it's okay. But after that, what next? If I continue moving up, I might be going too far away from the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps moving "LEFT" first would be better. Wait, but since the current direction is "RIGHT", can I immediately move "LEFT"? No, because reversing directions isn't allowed unless it's the first move. So maybe the snake needs to change direction in a way that doesn't reverse immediately.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think step by step.

1. Current position: (7,6), direction: RIGHT.
2. Apple at (0,9): Need to go left 7 units and up 3 units.
3. The initial movement can't be LEFT since that's a reversal from RIGHT, which is allowed only if it's the first move or if the snake isn't trapped.

So perhaps the first move should be UP to start moving towards the apple without reversing direction immediately.

If I choose "UP" as the first move:
- New head: (7,7)
- Check for collisions: The body parts are at (6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7). So (7,7) is currently empty. No collision.
- Since it's not eating the apple, the tail will move forward. The new body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)], and the tail moves to (6,6).
Wait, no: when moving normally, you insert the old head at front and remove the tail. So if I'm not eating the apple, the body would be updated by removing the last part.

But after the first move, the snake's head is at (7,7), body at (7,6). Then next moves can start to turn left.

But wait, after moving UP once, direction is still UP unless changed. So perhaps I need to change direction carefully.

Alternatively, maybe moving "RIGHT" again isn't helpful because it goes further away. But the initial direction is RIGHT, so I can continue moving right for one step and then try to turn.

Wait, no, that would take me towards x=8, which is even further from the apple at x=0. So that's not good.

So perhaps the first move should be UP, then LEFT, but I have to make sure that when changing direction, it doesn't reverse immediately in a way that causes a collision.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP until y=9 and then moving LEFT? But from (7,6) moving up would take me towards higher y-values. Let's see: moving up three times gets to (7,9). Then, need to move left 7 steps to reach x=0. That seems possible, but I have to check if the body can clear that path.

But each time the snake moves, it grows by one cell unless it eats the apple. So as I move towards the apple, I need to make sure that the body doesn't get in the way and that after eating, there's a way to continue moving.

Another consideration is that when the snake eats the apple, it should not trap itself, meaning after eating, it must have at least one legal move next turn. So I need to ensure that after eating, there's another direction to go without reversing into a wall or body.

Let me try planning a path:

1. Start at (7,6), direction RIGHT.
2. First move: UP → (7,7). Now, direction is still UP.
3. Second move: UP → (7,8).
4. Third move: UP → (7,9).

Now, I'm at y=9, x=7. The apple is at (0,9), so need to go left 7 times.

But since my current direction is UP, to turn LEFT, I can't reverse immediately. So perhaps after reaching (7,9), I need to change direction to LEFT without reversing.

Wait, if I'm moving UP and then try to move LEFT, that's allowed because it's a different direction. The only restriction is reversing direction, not changing directions in general.

So from (7,9), moving LEFT would be safe as long as the path is clear.

But wait, the body segments are currently [(6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)]. After moving up to (7,9), the new head is at (7,9). Then, the next move could be LEFT, but I need to check if that's allowed.

After each move, the body segments shift. So after first UP, body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)], and then moving UP again to (7,8) would make body [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6)], and so on.

But when I reach (7,9), I need to decide whether to turn LEFT or continue UP. Moving UP further doesn't help because the apple is at x=0. So turning LEFT seems necessary.

But how do I change direction? The current direction after moving UP would be UP, but I want to move LEFT next. Is that allowed?

Yes, as long as it's not a reversal of direction. Since I was moving UP and now will move LEFT, that's changing direction from UP to LEFT, which is allowed.

So:

5. Fourth move: LEFT → (6,9).
6. Check if that's safe. The body is at [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6)], so (6,9) is empty.
7. Now, new head at (6,9). Next direction can be LEFT again because we're already moving LEFT.

Continuing this:

5. Fourth move: LEFT → (5,9).
6. Fifth move: LEFT → (4,9).
7. Sixth move: LEFT → (3,9).
8. Seventh move: LEFT → (2,9).
9. Eighth move: LEFT → (1,9).

Now at (1,9), need to move further left to reach x=0.

But again, direction is LEFT, so I can continue moving LEFT:

10. Ninth move: LEFT → (0,9). This is the apple! So when the snake's head moves here, it eats the apple.

After eating, the body doesn't get removed because it grows by one. But I need to ensure that there's a legal move next turn.

So after eating at (0,9), the new head is (0,9). The direction was LEFT, but now what? If I try to continue moving LEFT from (0,9), it would go out of bounds because x=0 can't go further left. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the snake should have changed direction before reaching x=0 so that after eating, there's another move possible.

Wait, perhaps instead of moving all the way to x=0 in one move, I could have turned down at some point before that.

Let me try a different approach:

1. Start at (7,6), RIGHT.
2. First move: UP → (7,7).
3. Second move: UP → (7,8).
4. Third move: LEFT → (6,8). Now direction is LEFT.
5. Fourth move: LEFT → (5,8).
6. Fifth move: LEFT → (4,8).
7. Sixth move: LEFT → (3,8).
8. Seventh move: LEFT → (2,8).
9. Eighth move: UP → (2,9). Now at y=9.
10. Ninth move: LEFT → (1,9).
11. Tenth move: LEFT → (0,9). Eat the apple.

After eating, new head is (0,9), and direction was LEFT. But can't go further left from here. So need another direction without reversing into a wall or body.

But after eating, the snake's next move could be UP because it's at y=9, but moving down would take it towards x decreasing further. Wait, no: if at (0,9), moving LEFT is out of bounds, so not allowed. Moving UP would go to (0,10), which is also out of bounds. So that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the path so that after eating, there's a way to move in another direction without getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe instead of moving up all the way before turning left, I should turn left earlier and manage the body better.

Another idea: use a "double move" by first going up, then changing direction. But movement is per step, not simultaneous.

Wait, perhaps after moving to (7,9), it's possible to change direction down or something else, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe moving right isn't helpful because the initial position is closer to the center-right.

Let me try another path:

1. Start at (7,6), RIGHT.
2. Move LEFT → can I? No, since current direction is RIGHT and reversing would trap if not first move.

So can't do that immediately. Therefore, perhaps the first move must be UP.

3. First move: UP → (7,7).
4. Now, direction is UP. Next move can be LEFT without reversing because it's a different direction.

Wait, no: after moving UP, the next move is LEFT, which is allowed as it's not reversing from UP to LEFT. Reversing would mean going from UP to DOWN or something else that immediately turns back.

So:

4. Second move: LEFT → (6,7).
5. Now at (6,7), direction LEFT.
6. Next moves can continue LEFT towards the apple.

But then I need to go all the way down to y=9.

This seems too long and complicated.

Alternatively, maybe after moving UP once, I should start moving LEFT while also managing the body positions to prevent collisions.

I think this is getting too tangled. Let me try to list possible steps:

1. (7,6) → UP → (7,7).
2. (7,7) → LEFT → (6,7).
3. (6,7) → LEFT → (5,7).
4. (5,7) → LEFT → (4,7).
5. (4,7) → LEFT → (3,7). Now at x=3, y=7.
6. (3,7) → UP → (3,8).
7. (3,8) → UP → (3,9).
8. (3,9) → LEFT → (2,9).
9. (2,9) → LEFT → (1,9).
10. (1,9) → LEFT → (0,9). Eat the apple.

After eating, new head is at (0,9), direction was LEFT. Next possible moves:

- Can't move LEFT further as x=0.
- Can move UP or DOWN if possible.
But at y=9, moving UP would go to y=10 which is out of bounds. Moving DOWN from (0,9) takes you back to y=8, which might be clear.

Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's body includes (0,9), and previous positions. So if I move DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8), that position needs to be empty.

Is (0,8) currently occupied? Let me check: when we moved to (3,7), then UP to (3,8), etc., the body would have positions:

After step 10, before eating, the body is [(2,9), (1,9), (0,9)].

Wait, no: each move shifts the body. Let me track the body after each step more carefully.

Starting body: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

After first move: UP → (7,7). Body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)] + [rest]. Wait, no. When you move normally:

- Insert the old head at front.
- Remove the tail.

So initial body after step 1:

Old head was (7,6); new head is (7,7).

Body: [ (7,7) ] + [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Then remove the tail, which is (3,7). So body becomes [(7,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,7)].

Wait, no: initial body after starting:

[ (6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7) ] ?

No, the starting point is that the snake is at (7,6). The body segments are the parts behind it. So from (7,6) back to (6,6), then (5,6), etc., up to (3,7).

So when moving UP to (7,7):

- New head: (7,7)
- Body becomes: [(7,7), (7,6)] + [rest of body after (7,6)], which is [(6,6), (5,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

But wait, no: each segment follows. So from (7,6) to (6,6), then to (5,6), etc., up to (3,7). So when moving UP to (7,7), the body segments after the new head are the previous head and the rest.

So the new body is:

[ (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,7), (3,7) ].

Wait, that can't be because when moving normally, you only keep the first n-1 segments. So if it's a 5-segment snake, after moving, it should have 5 segments: new head + next four from previous body except the tail.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that each move adds a new head and removes the tail, so the number of body segments remains constant unless eating the apple.

Given that, let's try to plan without getting lost in the exact positions.

Another approach: use a snake path that moves towards the apple while avoiding reversing directions until it's safe.

Perhaps:

1. From (7,6) move UP as much as possible without getting stuck.
2. Once at y=9, start moving LEFT, changing direction from UP to LEFT, which is allowed since it's not reversing.
3. Continue moving LEFT towards x=0 while also managing the body positions.
4. When reaching near x=0, adjust direction to DOWN or something else to avoid trapping.

But I'm not sure if that will work without getting stuck.

Alternatively, consider using a spiral path or some other pattern to navigate around obstacles.

Wait, but since the snake can't reverse directions immediately after the first move, maybe it's better to make a U-turn in subsequent moves.

For example:

1. Start at (7,6), direction RIGHT.
2. Move UP → (7,7).
3. Now direction is UP. Next, move LEFT → (6,7). Direction remains LEFT because we changed from UP to LEFT.
4. Then continue moving LEFT towards the apple.

But after moving left several times, I might need to adjust direction again to DOWN or something else to avoid collisions with the body.

This seems possible but requires careful planning.

I think the key is that after the initial move of UP, changing direction to LEFT is allowed without reversing, so that path can be navigated safely towards the apple.

Therefore, a possible sequence would be:

1. (7,6) → UP → (7,7).
2. (7,7) → LEFT → (6,7).
3. (6,7) → LEFT → (5,7).
4. Continue moving LEFT until x=0.
5. When near the top, adjust direction as needed.

But I also need to ensure that when the snake is at (1,9), it can move LEFT to (0,9) safely without reversing from LEFT to LEFT again.

Wait, no: after moving to (6,7), direction is LEFT. Then moving to (5,7), etc., all in LEFT direction until reaching x=0.

But when I'm at (1,9), moving LEFT again would take me to (0,9). That's allowed because it's the same direction; no reversal involved.

So:

10. (2,9) → LEFT → (1,9).
11. (1,9) → LEFT → (0,9).

Eat the apple here.

After eating, new head at (0,9), direction is LEFT. But can't go further left from x=0. So next moves must avoid getting stuck.

Perhaps move DOWN to (0,8). If that's clear, it's allowed.

But I need to check if moving DOWN from (0,9) would collide with any body segments.

Assuming the snake has enough length, after eating the apple, the body extends behind. So moving DOWN might be possible.

But without exact position tracking, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, a viable path seems to involve:

- Moving UP once.
- Then moving LEFT all the way to x=0.
- Eats the apple at (0,9).
- Then move DOWN or another direction if possible to avoid getting stuck.

I think this is manageable and avoids immediate reversal issues after the first move. Therefore, a possible solution path is:

Move UP once, then LEFT multiple times, eat the apple at x=0, y=9, and adjust direction accordingly.
</think>

To solve the problem of navigating from (7,6) to (0,9) without immediately reversing direction, follow these steps:

1. **Move Up**: From (7,6), move up to (7,7).
2. **Turn Left**: Change direction to left and proceed westward towards (0,9). This involves moving left from (7,7) through each x-coordinate decrementing by 1 until reaching (0,9).
3. **Eat the Apple**: Arrive at (0,9), consuming the apple.
4. **Adjust Direction**: From (0,9), move down if possible to avoid being stuck.

This path avoids immediate direction reversal after the initial move and safely reaches the goal.

**Answer:**
Move up once to (7,7), then turn left towards (0,9), eat the apple, and adjust direction as needed.
