You are an AI controlling a snake in a classic Snake game. Your goal is to provide MULTIPLE MOVES at once to help the snake eat apples and survive.

Game State:

Legend:
. = Empty space
S = Snake body
A = Apple
H = Snake head (no direction, hence can go any direction)
H↑ = Snake head (facing UP)
H→ = Snake head (facing RIGHT)
H↓ = Snake head (facing DOWN)
H← = Snake head (facing LEFT)
| and - = Walls (game boundary)

Coordinates are (row, column) with (0,0) at the top-left corner

Snake head position: (5, 5)
Apple position: (9, 4)

Directional guide:
- UP: Decreases row coordinate (moves toward row 0)
- DOWN: Increases row coordinate (moves toward row 9)
- LEFT: Decreases column coordinate (moves toward column 0)
- RIGHT: Increases column coordinate (moves toward column 9)

GAME OBJECTIVE:
Your goal is to eat as many apples (A) as possible without dying. Each apple increases your score by 1 point.

GAME MECHANICS:
1. The snake dies if it hits a wall (| or -) or its own body (S)
2. The snake's head (H) shows which direction you're currently moving
3. When you eat an apple, the snake grows longer, making it harder to avoid collisions
4. The game board is enclosed by walls - you cannot move past the edges

UNDERSTANDING THE 2D GRID:
Here is a small 4x4 example to help you understand how movement works:

Initial state (head facing right):
  -+-+-+-+-
  0 1 2 3
0|. . A .|
1|. . . .|
2|. H←S .|
3|. . . .|
  -+-+-+-+-

After moving UP from initial state:
  -+-+-+-+-
  0 1 2 3
0|. . A .|
1|. H↑. .|
2|. S . .|
3|. . . .|
  -+-+-+-+-

It cannot move RIGHT from initial state because the snake's head's right side is a cell of his body S. Also, because we cannot go against the direction of the snake's head.

After moving DOWN from initial state:
  -+-+-+-+-
  0 1 2 3
0|. . A .|
1|. . . .|
2|. S . .|
3|. H↓. .|
  -+-+-+-+-

After moving LEFT from initial state:
  -+-+-+-+-
  0 1 2 3
0|. . A .|
1|. . . .|
2|H←S . .|
3|. . . .|
  -+-+-+-+-

HOW TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE STEPS:
1. Analyze the current state and plan a safe path toward the apple
2. Provide a SEQUENCE of 5-30 moves that will help the snake reach the apple
3. Format your response as a numbered list of directions, for example:
   1. UP
   2. RIGHT
   3. RIGHT
   4. UP
   5. LEFT

RULES FOR YOUR RESPONSE:
- You MUST provide at least 5 sequential moves (unless you expect to reach the apple sooner)
- Valid directions are: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
- You cannot move in the opposite direction of your current movement

THINK STEP BY STEP about the best sequence of moves, then output your final decision.
