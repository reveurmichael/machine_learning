<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out a path for the snake from (4,4) to (4,0), avoiding collisions and respecting all the movement rules. Let's start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (4,4), direction is UP, body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)]. The apple is at (4,0). 

First, I should visualize where everything is. The snake starts with the head moving upwards because the direction is UP. But wait, no—the current direction is UP, so it will try to move in that direction first.

But if the snake moves up from (4,4), its new head would be (4,5). I need to check for collisions. Let's see: the body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)]. The new head is at (4,5), which isn't occupied by any of these except maybe the tail? Wait, no—the initial body doesn't include (4,5). So that might be okay.

But wait, if it moves up to (4,5), then in the next step, when updating the body, we need to make sure that the new head is not colliding with any body cells except possibly the tail. But moving from (4,4) UP would take it to (4,5). Since none of the current body segments are at (4,5), this seems safe.

But after moving up, the next step might be tricky because the snake's body is growing or not? Wait, in the first move, since we're not eating the apple, the tail will drop. So the body becomes [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)] with the head at (4,5). That seems okay.

Wait, no—when moving, you insert the old head into the front of the body and remove the last element if not eating. Since we're not eating the apple on this first move, removing the tail is required. So after moving up to (4,5), the new head is inserted at the front, making the body [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2)]. Then remove the last element because we didn't eat—so the body becomes [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)].

Wait, but the initial body was three cells: [ (4,3), (4,2), (5,2) ]. So after moving up, insert head at front and remove tail. The new body is [ (4,5), (4,3), (4,2) ], since we have to keep all except the last.

But now the snake's head is at (4,5). Next move: can it continue towards UP again? If so, moving up would take it to (4,6), which might be okay. But let me check each step carefully.

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT or RIGHT first could help avoid potential future collisions. Since the current direction is UP and we cannot reverse on the next move unless it's a valid path.

Wait, according to the movement rules: "Cannot reverse": so after moving up, if I try to go down again, that would be reversing and not allowed. So in subsequent moves, direction can't immediately return to previous—except when starting from NONE.

But since the initial direction is UP, then next move cannot be DOWN unless it's a valid path.

Hmm. Let me plan step by step:

Current state: head (4,4), direction UP, body [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)], apple at (4,0).

First move options from current position and direction:

Option 1: Move UP to (4,5). Since the new head is not colliding with any existing body except possibly if the tail will be moving. But since we're not eating the apple, the tail won't move—so no collision.

After this move:
- New head is (4,5)
- Body becomes [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)]
No collision detected. So this seems safe.

Option 2: Move LEFT to (3,4). Let's see if that's possible. Current direction is UP; moving LEFT doesn't reverse the current movement direction—so allowed as long as it doesn't cause a collision.

New head at (3,4). Check if any body cells are at (3,4) except for when tail moves. The current body is [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)]. So new_head isn't in the body, so safe to move.

After this move:
- New head is (3,4)
- Body becomes [(3,4), (4,3), (4,2)]
But then next direction would need to be compatible with LEFT or something else.

Wait, but moving LEFT first might not lead us directly towards the apple at (4,0). The snake's x-coordinate needs to decrease from 4 to 4—so no change in x. Wait, wait—the apple is at (4,0), so we're on the same column as the head's starting position? No, the apple is at (4,0) which is four steps below and in the same row. Wait, actually, both have x=4 but y changes.

Wait: current head is (4,4). Apple is at (4,0), so they are on the same column but different rows. So to reach there, we need to move down multiple times? But movement direction is UP, which would take us away from the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT and RIGHT could help snake around.

But given that the body cells after first step (if moved up) are in higher x positions, maybe moving right or left early on can lead towards the apple indirectly. Alternatively, maybe we should try to move down eventually but direction is currently UP.

Wait no—direction is UP; movement rules say if you choose a new direction, it cannot reverse from current unless it's NONE (the first move). So after UP, next moves cannot be DOWN until something else.

But perhaps moving towards the apple in another axis could help. Let me think differently: perhaps moving LEFT or RIGHT to adjust y-coordinate?

Wait, no—apple is at (4,0), which is same x as head's current position but different y. So we need to move down four times from (4,4) to reach (4,0). But if direction is UP, choosing DOWN would reverse the direction.

But according to movement rules: cannot reverse direction on first move unless it's NONE. Wait no—movement rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": you can't choose a direction that is opposite of current except for some cases? Wait, more precisely:

"Current direction is 'UP', so next move can be anything except 'DOWN' if the snake wants to continue moving up again?

Wait: movement rules say "Cannot reverse"—so from UP, the next direction cannot be DOWN because it's a direct reversal. Similarly, from LEFT, next can't be RIGHT unless necessary.

But perhaps during subsequent steps, once you've moved away from UP, then moving DOWN is allowed.

So maybe first move UP to (4,5), then continue in some other direction without directly reversing the current direction.

Alternatively, maybe we need a different approach. Let me consider that after each step, I should track where the snake's body is and ensure future positions are safe.

Wait, another idea: since the apple is at (4,0), which is four steps below the head in the same column, perhaps moving down towards it once direction allows.

But first move is UP—so maybe to get back to DOWN later. Let me try:

First move: LEFT from current position to (3,4). Then next moves can be arranged so that eventually we can go down and reach apple.

Alternatively, I should consider the path step by step, ensuring each move doesn't cause collision and allows a way forward.

But perhaps starting with moving UP first is better because it's towards higher y-values. Let me attempt to see:

Move 1: UP → (4,5). No collision as body isn't there.

Then, next direction cannot be DOWN yet—so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE if needed.

Suppose after Move 1: direction is still UP. But no, since we can't reverse immediately—it's only not allowed to go directly from UP to DOWN in the first move, but once moved away, you can come back later. So next moves cannot be DOWN yet.

So after moving up to (4,5), possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE if starting fresh—wait no, we've already made one move: so current direction was UP; moving UP again would still not reverse, but according to the rules, you can't choose a direction opposite of your previous one. So from UP, next cannot be DOWN.

Wait, perhaps I misread. The rule says "Cannot reverse"—so for example, if you are going UP, you cannot go DOWN in the next move. Similarly, LEFT and RIGHT cannot switch directly on next step unless it's NONE. But once you've moved away from that direction, then reversing is allowed again.

So let me clarify: From current direction D, next possible directions are all except the reverse of D (except for when not moving at all). For example:

If current direction is UP, next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE. But cannot go DOWN on the next step because it's a direct reversal from UP.

Similarly, if current is LEFT, next can be UP, RIGHT, or NONE—can't go DOWN (but wait, LEFT and RIGHT are opposites but not directly opposite of each other? Wait no: LEFT is (-1,0), RIGHT is (+1,0); their reverses are right and left. So maybe from LEFT, you cannot move to RIGHT in the next step.

Wait, perhaps movement rules state that:

- If current direction is UP, then next can be any except DOWN.
- If current is DOWN, next can't be UP.
- Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT: if currently going LEFT, next cannot go RIGHT; if currently RIGHT, next cannot go LEFT unless it's a straight line.

Wait no—movement rules say "Cannot reverse", so perhaps from current direction D, you can't choose the opposite of D. So in general:

From UP → cannot choose DOWN
From DOWN → cannot choose UP
From LEFT → cannot choose RIGHT
From RIGHT → cannot choose LEFT

But wait, perhaps that's not entirely accurate—maybe only on same step.

Wait according to movement rules: "Cannot reverse": so from direction D, next can't be the opposite of D (reverse). So for example:

- From UP, you can't go DOWN in the next move.
- From LEFT, can't go RIGHT; but after moving away from LEFT, you might come back.

Alternatively, perhaps "cannot reverse" refers to not being able to choose a direction that is directly opposite. So if you're going UP, you cannot go DOWN on the next step—so movement rules for reversal:

From UP → can't move DOWN
From DOWN → can't move UP
From LEFT → can't move RIGHT
From RIGHT → can't move LEFT

But perhaps this is allowed after multiple steps.

So with that in mind, let's try to plan a path towards the apple at (4,0). 

Current position: (4,4), direction UP. Body cells are [ (4,3), (4,2), (5,2) ]

First move:

Option 1: Move UP → (4,5)

After this:

New head is (4,5)
Body becomes [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)] because we insert the old head at front and remove last element since not eating.

This seems safe as (4,5) isn't in current body except for possible future steps.

Next step: from position (4,5), direction is still UP but can't go DOWN. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

If we choose to move LEFT:

New head would be (3,5). Is that safe?

Current body after first move is [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)]. New head at (3,5) isn't in the body. So moving LEFT is okay.

After this move:
- Head: (3,5)
- Body becomes [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,3) ]

Now direction from previous was UP; now moved LEFT—so no reversal yet because we're changing direction to LEFT instead of going back DOWN. So allowed.

Next step:

Current position is (3,5). Direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT since it's the opposite.

Options: Move UP, DOWN, or NONE.

Let me see if moving down would get us closer to apple at (4,0), but perhaps from (3,5) moving DOWN takes us to (3,4).

Wait, 3 is x-coordinate; moving DOWN changes y. So from (3,5) moving DOWN by one step would be (3,4). But that's a different column.

But I need to get to (4,0), same row as initial head position but lower y. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT can help reach closer columns and then go down.

Wait, if we have body cells in higher x positions after first move—could getting back towards 4 be possible?

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to spiral around the snake's body to reach (4,0).

But this might get complicated. Let me think about what happens when moving RIGHT:

From position (3,5), if we choose RIGHT → (4,5). 

Check for collision: new head is at (4,5); current body after previous move was [(3,5), (4,5), (4,3)]. So the new head (4,5) is already in the second position of the body. Therefore, moving RIGHT would cause a collision with the existing body cell.

So this direction isn't allowed—it's invalid and can't choose it.

Therefore, after being at (3,5), from LEFT direction, possible moves are:

- UP to (3,6): safe if not colliding.
- DOWN to (3,4).
- NONE: no movement; but that wouldn't progress toward the apple.

Let me see where moving DOWN would take us. From (3,5) to (3,4). Current body is [(3,5), (4,5), (4,3)]. New head at (3,4): not in current body except for possible future steps—so safe.

After this move:
- Head: (3,4)
- Body becomes [ (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) ]

Now direction was LEFT; moving DOWN is allowed because it's not the opposite of LEFT. So now we can choose other directions again.

Next step:

Current position (3,4); current body: [ (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) ].

Possible moves from here: since last move was DOWN, next cannot be UP if in same column?

Wait no—movement rules only say you can't choose the opposite of your previous direction. So after moving LEFT then DOWN, the next direction is not restricted except for:

- If previous direction was DOWN, you can't choose UP.

In this case, last direction was DOWN; so next move cannot be UP.

So possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE (if needed).

Wait current body positions are at x=3 and 4. So moving RIGHT to (4,4) could be an option—if allowed without collision.

From position (3,4), moving RIGHT → (4,4). Check if new head is (4,4); the existing body includes [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]. So new head at (4,4): not present in current body except for possible when tail moves. Since we're not eating the apple now, it's safe to move.

After this move:
- Head: (4,4)
- Body becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]

But wait—this seems to take us back where we were initially! This is a problem because moving RIGHT from (3,4) brings us back to (4,4). But body cells are now [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)], which includes the new head.

So if we then attempt to move in any direction again:

Moving LEFT would take us back down to (3,4)—but that's where we just came from. Alternatively, moving DOWN → y=3—so from (4,4) moving DOWN is allowed? Wait no—if current position was (4,4), but after this step, the new head is at (4,4). So what about moving DOWN:

From (4,4): Moving DOWN would take us to (4,3).

Check collision: existing body cells are [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]. New head at (4,3) isn't present. So safe.

After this move:
- Head: (4,3)
- Body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) ]

But wait—the body includes the new head and the previous positions.

Now we're getting into a loop here—each time moving back towards where we were. This is problematic because it's going to take us in circles without making progress toward the apple at (4,0).

So perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think of another way.

Alternative plan: Maybe after initial moves, try to snake down into lower y-values by adjusting directions appropriately.

Wait, let's backtrack a bit.

Another idea: since we are trying to reach (4,0), which is in the same x=4 column but much lower y than current position. Maybe it's better to move DOWN towards that area rather than going LEFT or RIGHT first.

But given that the initial direction is UP, and movement rules prevent us from moving directly DOWN next step because of reversing.

Wait no—if we're at (4,4), with body [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)], if I choose to move DOWN → y becomes 3. But according to current movement rules, since the initial direction is UP, can't reverse on next move—so from UP, can't go DOWN.

Therefore, first step must be either LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE—but moving NONE would not progress towards apple.

But perhaps moving up isn't leading us closer; maybe we need a different strategy.

Wait another thought: perhaps using the body as a support to move in other directions. For example, by moving right and then left again when possible, making turns that allow downward movement without collision.

Let me try:

First Move 1: UP → (4,5). Body becomes [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)].
Now direction is still UP; next can't move DOWN. So options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Move 2: LEFT to (3,5). Body becomes [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,3) ]

Now from here, since last direction was LEFT, cannot reverse to RIGHT on next move. But perhaps moving DOWN is allowed if it's not the opposite of previous direction?

Wait no—movement rules: From any direction D, you can't go directly opposite. So after moving LEFT, next can be UP or NONE—but can't go RIGHT.

So from (3,5), current body [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,3) ], and direction is LEFT:

Next possible moves are UP or NONE.

Move 3: UP → y becomes 6. But that's moving away from the apple; maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, Move 3: NONE—no movement.

But this isn't progress either.

Alternative approach:

First move: UP to (4,5) as before.
Second move: RIGHT to (5,5). Check collision with body [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)]. New head is (5,5); no conflict. So safe.

After this move:
- Head: (5,5)
- Body becomes [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,3) ]

Now from here, direction was RIGHT; next can't choose LEFT. Possible moves are DOWN or NONE.

Move 3: DOWN to y=4 → (5,4). Is this position safe? Check current body after second move is [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,3) ].

New head at (5,4): not present except for possible future steps. So yes, it's okay.

After Move 3:
- Head: (5,4)
- Body becomes [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ]

Now from here, direction was DOWN; next move can't be UP because it's the opposite of DOWN.

Possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

Move 4: RIGHT → x=6. y remains 4. New head at (6,4). Check body after Move3 is [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ]. So new head isn't present; safe.

After this move:
- Head: (6,4)
- Body becomes [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Now from here, direction was RIGHT. Next cannot choose LEFT.

Possible moves are DOWN or NONE.

Move 5: DOWN → y=3 at (6,3). Check for collision with body after Move4 is [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,5) ]. So new head isn't present; safe.

After this move:
- Head: (6,3)
- Body becomes [ (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ]

Now from here, direction was DOWN. Next can't choose UP.

Move 6: RIGHT → x=7, y remains 3 at (7,3). Check for collision with body [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]—no conflict; safe.

After this move:
- Head: (7,3)
- Body becomes [ (7,3), (6,3), (6,4) ]

This seems to be going further away from the apple at (4,0). We're moving right and down, but not getting closer.

Alternative Idea:

Perhaps a more strategic approach is needed. Maybe using the body's structure as a support to move in other directions without causing collisions.

Wait another thought: perhaps the key is to find a way to have segments of the body help us snake towards the apple by allowing turns that don't cause collision.

For example, if after moving right and down, we can turn left again, using some existing body cells as support points.

Let me try this:

After Move 1: UP → (4,5). Body is [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)].
Move 2: RIGHT to (5,5). Body becomes [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,3) ]

From here, direction was RIGHT. Next can't choose LEFT.

Move 3: DOWN → y=4 at (5,4). Is this allowed? No collision as body is [(5,5), (4,5), (4,3)].
After move:
- Head: (5,4)
- Body becomes [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ]

Now direction was DOWN. Next can't choose UP.

Move 4: RIGHT → (6,4). Body is now [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]. Check no collision.
After move:
- Head: (6,4)
- Body becomes [ (6,4), (6,5), ... ]

Wait this approach isn't getting us closer to the apple. Perhaps I'm stuck in a loop or moving away.

Alternative Idea:

Perhaps we need to move backwards along the current body's x-axis so that when we turn around, it helps us get back towards lower y-values without collision.

Another Plan:

From initial position (4,4), direction UP.

First Move: UP → (4,5). Body is [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)].
Second Move: LEFT to (3,5) as before. Then from there moving DOWN isn't helpful because it's not allowed due to previous direction being LEFT.

Alternative Step 2 after reaching (4,5): Maybe instead of going LEFT or RIGHT, try another approach.

Wait maybe I should consider trying to move towards the apple at (4,0), which is in same column but much lower y. So perhaps moving DOWN isn't directly possible due to movement rules and body structure.

But since we can't reverse direction on next step after an initial UP, it's challenging. Maybe instead of moving LEFT first, I should try another way.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that from position (4,5), any move except UP would lead us away or not towards the apple, but according to movement rules, can we make moves in such a way as to eventually get closer?

Another Idea:

Instead of trying to move right and then left without making progress toward lower y, perhaps adjust the body's formation so that when moving down later on, it doesn't collide.

Wait this seems too vague. Let me try to think step by step with specific moves.

Alternative Approach:
We can model each possible position along with the snake's body as a tuple of coordinates, and for each state, consider all possible next moves ensuring no collision.

Given that the apple is at (4,0), same x=4 but much lower y. So perhaps if we could move down without collision from higher up positions on the same column or adjacent columns.

But considering our movement rules:

1. From initial position (4,4) with body [ (4,3), (4,2), (5,2) ]

First Move: UP to (4,5). Body is now [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)] because we remove the last cell.

Second Move: Can't go DOWN since previous was UP. So options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Move 2: LEFT to (3,5).

Now body is [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,3) ]

Third Move: Direction was LEFT. Next can't move RIGHT; possible moves are UP or NONE.

But moving UP from (3,5) would take us back towards the apple but into a lower y?

Wait (3,5): if we move DOWN to (3,4).

Current body is [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,3) ]

From here, new head at (3,4). Check for collision. Body doesn't have this coordinate.

So Move 3: DOWN → (3,4)

Now body becomes [ (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) ]

Fourth Move: Direction was DOWN; next can't move UP.

Options are LEFT or RIGHT or NONE.

Move 4: RIGHT to (4,4). New head at (4,4).

Check for collision with existing body [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]. So new head is not in the current body except for possible future steps. Safe.

After Move 4:
- Head: (4,4)
- Body becomes [ (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) ]

Now direction was RIGHT; next can't choose LEFT.

Move 5: UP → y=5 at (4,5). But new head is already present in the body after Move4's result. So this would cause collision with the existing cell at (4,5)? Because current body is [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)].

Wait no—after Move 4:

Body is [ (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) ]

So when moving UP to (4,5):

Is this new position (4,5) present in the body? No. So it's safe; because current body has only (4,4).

Therefore, Move 5: UP is allowed.

After Move 5:
- Head: (4,5)
- Body becomes [ (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ]

Now direction was RIGHT; next can't move LEFT. So possible moves are DOWN or NONE.

Move 6: DOWN → y=4 at (4,4). But new head is already present in the body after Move5's result because current body is [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4)]—so moving down to (4,4) would collide with itself? Because next step is inserting into front and removing last.

Wait no—it’s only collision if new head is already present in the current body. Since after Move 5:

Body becomes [ (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ]

So moving DOWN from here to y=3 at (4,3). 

Check for collision with existing body which doesn't include (4,3); so it's safe.

After Move 6:
- Head: (4,3)
- Body becomes [ (4,3), (4,5), (4,4) ]

Hmm. Now direction was DOWN; next move can't be UP.

Move 7: Can only choose LEFT or RIGHT or NONE.

Move 7: LEFT to x=3 at y=3 → (3,3). Check for collision with body after Move6's result is [ (4,3), (4,5), (4,4) ]. So new head isn't present; safe.

After Move 7:
- Head: (3,3)
- Body becomes [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,5) ]

Now direction was LEFT; next move can’t be RIGHT. Possible moves are DOWN or NONE.

Move 8: DOWN → y=2 at (3,2). Check for collision with body after Move7's result is [(3,3), (4,3), (4,5)]—no conflict.
After this move:
- Head: (3,2)
- Body becomes [ (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) ]

Move 9: Direction was DOWN; next can't choose UP.

Possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT or NONE. Let's try RIGHT to x=4 at y=2 → (4,2). Check for collision with body after Move8 is [ (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) ]. So new head isn't present; safe.

After Move 9:
- Head: (4,2)
- Body becomes [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]

Move10: Direction was RIGHT; next can’t choose LEFT. Possible moves: DOWN or NONE.

Move10: DOWN → y=1 at (4,1). Check for collision with body after Move9 is [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]—safe.
After this move:
- Head: (4,1)
- Body becomes [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2) ]

Move11: Direction was DOWN; next can't choose UP.

Possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT. Let's try LEFT to x=3 at y=1 → (3,1). Check for collision with body after Move10 is [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)]—no conflict.
After this move:
- Head: (3,1)
- Body becomes [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]

Move12: Direction was LEFT; next can't choose RIGHT. Possible moves: DOWN or NONE.

Move12: DOWN → y=0 at (3,0). Check for collision with body after Move11 is [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]—safe.
After this move:
- Head: (3,0)
- Body becomes [ (3,0), (3,1), (4,1) ]

Now we're at y=0. But the apple is at (4,0). Let's see:

From here, direction was DOWN; next can't choose UP.

Possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT or NONE.

Move13: RIGHT → x=4 at y=0 → (4,0). Check for collision with body after Move12 is [(3,0), (3,1), (4,1)]—no conflict. So we've found the apple!

After this move:
- Head: (4,0) which is where the apple is.

Thus, it's possible to reach the apple by following these steps.
</think>

To reach the apple located at (4, 0), follow these steps:

1. **Initial Position**: Start at (4, 4). The snake body consists of [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)].

2. **Move Up**: Move to (4,5). Snake body becomes [(4,5), (4,3), (4,2)].

3. **Move Left**: Move to (3,5). Snake body is now [(3,5), (4,5), (4,3)].

4. **Move Down**: Go to (3,4). Snake body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)].

5. **Move Right**: Move to (4,4). Snake body is [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)].

6. **Move Up**: Ascend to (4,5). Snake body becomes [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4)].

7. **Move Down**: Descend to (4,4). Wait, this isn't helpful as it's on the same y-level. Instead, proceed to:

8. **Move Left**: Go to (3,4). Snake body becomes [(3,4), (4,5), (4,4)].

9. **Move Down**: Move down to (3,3). Snake body is [(3,3), (3,4), (4,5)].

10. **Move Right**: Ascend to (4,3). Snake body becomes [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4)].

11. **Move Down**: Descend to (4,2). Snake body is [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)].

12. **Move Left**: Move left to (3,2). Snake body becomes [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)].

13. **Move Right**: Ascend to (4,2). Wait, this doesn't help; correct step:

    13. **Move Down**: From (4,2), move down to (4,1). Snake body becomes [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2)].

14. **Move Left**: Move left to (3,1). Snake body is [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2)].

15. **Move Down**: Descend to (3,0) where the apple is located! Wait, actually:

    After moving down from (4,1), you reach (4,0).

So after 15 steps, you've reached the apple at (4, 0).

**Final Answer**

It's possible to reach the apple with a series of moves. The answer is $\boxed{(4, 0)}$.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (4, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)], to eat the apple at (4, 0).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
