00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Hey guys this is Evan from EZ Origami! 
And today I'll be teaching you how to

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,910
fold an origami Royal Rose Cube designed
by Maria Sinayskaya. This is a beautiful

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,320
modular design and it's perfect for
Mother's Day. This model requires six

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,730
square sheets of paper. Each unit is
folded from one square, and in order to

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,660
fold each unit you'll eventually divide
the paper into thirds. So instead of

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,660
approximating, I'll teach you how to make
a folding tool which will help you

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,710
quickly divide each square into thirds. You will need 6 squares to fold the

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,890
units and you'll need an additional
square of the same size for the folding

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,690
tool, so you'll need a total of 7 equally
sized squares. And I recommend using 6

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,230
inch or larger squares with the same
color on both sides to fold this model.

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,550
Using 6 inch squares will result in a
model about 3.5 inches wide.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,180
Thicker paper such as tant and
stardream also seem to work really well

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,750
with this model. And I'm going to be
using larger paper with color on one

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,620
side and white on the other just to make
it a bit easier to follow along. And

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,160
we're going to start by making the
folding tool. So take 1 square and make

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,160
sure it's the same size as the other 6
squares that you will use for the units.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,729
And once you've prepared your paper, then
we're going to start by folding in half

18
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,479
diagonally. So take this bottom right
corner and fold it up to the top left

19
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,560
corner. Align the corners on the edges,
then make your crease, and then unfold.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,520
And now we're going to fold up this
bottom edge and align it with the

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,700
diagonal crease that we just created. So
I'm just going to pull up the bottom

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,939
edge like this. And we want to start at
the bottom left corner and work our way

23
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,650
up and over to the right aligning that
edge with the crease, just like this. And

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,500
once everything is aligned, then you can
make your crease and then you can unfold.

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,380
Then we're going to rotate the paper so
that the two creases we just made now

26
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,649
extend from this top right corner. And
from here we're going to fold over this

27
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,430
right edge and align it with this top
crease that we just made. So we're going

28
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,549
to start by pulling this right edge over
to the left. And we want to start at the

29
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,240
top right corner and work our way down
and over to the left until the entire

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,860
edge is aligned with that crease, just
like this. And then you can make your

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,170
crease. And then you can unfold. And now I
want you to notice this point here where

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,979
the crease that we just made intersects
with this bottom edge. And what we want

33
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,790
to do is fold this bottom right corner
over to align with that point. So we're

34
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,420
just going to pull over the right edge
of the paper,

35
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,370
just like this, until that bottom corner
aligns with that intersection. And before

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,770
you make your crease, you want to make
sure that the vertical edges on the

37
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,280
top and the bottom of the model are
aligned as well. And once everything is

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,050
aligned, then you can make your crease. Then we're going to rotate the paper 180

39
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,400
degrees. And this is your completed
folding tool. And once you have this, then

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,100
you're going to take one of the six
squares that you prepared for the units

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,130
and you're going to hold it with the
white side up. Then we're going to lift

42
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,340
up our first square and we want to slide
it in between the two layers of the

43
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,269
folding tool by pushing it over to the
left as far as it'll go. You want to push

44
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,360
it over until the left edge of the
square aligns with this left folded edge

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
on the folding tool. And from here we're
going to fold over the right edge of our

46
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,680
square and align it with this colored
edge on the folding tool. So we're just

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,190
going to pull over the right edge of the
paper, just like this, until both of those

48
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,549
colored edges are aligned. Then you can
make your crease. And then we can pull

49
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,000
our square outside of the folding tool. And then you can put the folding tool

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,799
aside. Then you can unfold this colored
flap and then we want to fold over this

51
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,489
left edge and align it with the vertical
crease that we just created. So we're

52
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,970
just going to lift up this left edge and
pull it over to the right until the

53
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,930
colored edge is completely aligned with
that vertical crease. Then you can make

54
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,359
your crease. And then you can unfold. And
now you'll see that you've divided your

55
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,560
square into thirds. Then we're going to
turn the paper over and we want to fold

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,489
up this bottom right corner and align it
with this rightmost vertical crease. So

57
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,220
we're just going to pull the bottom
right corner over to the left, and once

58
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,250
this small white edge aligns with that
vertical crease, then you can make your

59
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,790
crease. And now we're going to fold over
the bottom left corner and align it with

60
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,090
that same vertical crease. So we're just
going to pull that corner over to the

61
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,660
right, just like this. And once the white
edge is aligned with that vertical

62
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,359
crease and the flap that we just folded over, then you can make your crease. And

63
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,470
then you can unfold. Then we're going to
rotate the paper 180 degrees and we're

64
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,380
going to do the same exact thing. So once
again we're going to start with this

65
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,530
bottom right corner and we want to align
it with this rightmost vertical crease.

66
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,639
So we're just going to pull that corner over
to the left, and once the small white

67
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,450
edge is aligned with that vertical
crease then you can make your crease.

68
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,909
Then we're going to fold over this
bottom left corner and again align it

69
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:25,090
with the rightmost vertical crease. So
we're just going to pull it over to the

70
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,990
right, just like this. And you'll see that the white corner

71
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,650
will also align with this crease
intersection here. Then you can make your

72
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:38,220
crease and then you can unfold. And then
we're going to turn the paper over. And

73
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,730
now we're going to make a crease the
pivots from this bottom corner here. So

74
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,060
what we want to do is lift up this
bottom right corner, and we want to

75
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,020
slightly pinch the paper at that point just so that our crease starts there. Then we want to pivot this colored flap around that point, just like this. And we

76
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,200
want to adjust it until this colored corner aligns with this vertical crease

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,250
here. And once this edge reaches those
two reference points, then you can make

78
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,840
your crease. Then we're going to rotate
the paper 180 degrees and we're going to

79
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,290
do the same exact thing. So we're just
going to lift up the bottom right corner

80
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,080
and we want to slightly pinch the paper
at that point just to make sure our

81
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,320
crease starts there. Then you want to
slightly adjust this colored flap while

82
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,740
pivoting around that point until this
colored corner aligns with this vertical

83
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,000
crease. And once the edge reaches both of
those references, then you can make your

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,840
crease. And from here we're going to fold
over the right side of the model along

85
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,170
this existing vertical crease. And we're
going to do that by pulling the right

86
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,010
side of the model over to the left, but
we don't want to crease all the way. We

87
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,770
want to start at the top of the model
and work our way down until you reach

88
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,710
this point here where the diagonal
crease intersects with the crease that

89
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,490
we just made. Then from here we want to
fold this colored flap over to the right

90
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,030
along that existing diagonal crease. So
we're simply going to fold it over like

91
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,480
this, then you want to reinforce that
crease along the inside of the model,

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,080
just like this. And at this point you'll
notice that the model does not lie flat.

93
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,060
And the idea is to keep this edge curved
to give the unit a more organic shape. So

94
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,810
what we want to do is fold that edge
over to the inner colored edge here. So

95
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,100
we're just going to align both of those
edges, just like this. And as you're

96
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,830
making this crease, you'll notice that
you're just reinforcing a crease on a

97
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,950
layer below. And you want to make sure
that you don't completely flatten out

98
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,600
the model because we want to keep this
edge curved. And once you have that, then

99
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,780
we're going to rotate the paper 180
degrees and we're going to do the same

100
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,930
thing. So again we're going to start by
folding the right side of the model over

101
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,310
to the left along this existing vertical
crease here. So we're just going to pull

102
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,540
it over to the left like this, but again
we don't want to crease all the way. We

103
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,080
want to start at the top of the model
and work our way down until you reach

104
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,140
this point here where the diagonal
crease intersects with the crease that

105
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,580
we were just making. Then we want to fold
this colored flap over to the

106
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,939
right along that existing diagonal
crease. So we're just going to fold it

107
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,360
over like that, and you carefully want to
reinforce that crease along the inside

108
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,439
of the model. And again you'll notice
this curved edge here. And what we want

109
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,759
to do is fold that edge over to the left
along this white edge inside. So we're

110
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,819
just going to fold the edge in along that
white edge there, and again you're just

111
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,449
reinforcing an existing crease on a
layer below. And you don't want to

112
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,629
completely flatten out the model because
we want to leave this part curved to

113
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:09,349
give the unit a more organic shape. And
once you've done that on both sides then

114
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,620
we're going to slightly rotate the model. And now I want you to notice this white

115
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,699
triangular flap here. And what we want to
do is grab those layers from underneath

116
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,449
just to untuck it a bit. Then from here
we want to talk this white triangular

117
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,620
flap underneath this colored layer below. So we're going to do that by lifting up

118
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,159
the model, and we carefully want to slide
that triangular flap underneath the

119
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:33,069
colored layer like this as far as it'll
go. So just slide it all the way inside,

120
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,800
flatten out the right side of the model,
and then you can put everything back

121
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,029
down. And once you have that, then we're
going to rotate the paper 180 degrees 

122
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:44,960
and we're going to do the same thing. So
once again, we want to untuck this white

123
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,949
triangular flap here by simply grabbing
those layers from underneath. Then we

124
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,969
want to tuck that white triangular flap
underneath this colored layer below. So

125
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:55,940
we're just going to lift up the model
and we're going to carefully slide that

126
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,810
white flap underneath the colored layer
just like this. And then you can flatten

127
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,050
out the right side of the model. And now
we're going to make two mountain folds

128
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,529
along these vertical edges here. But I
find it easiest to do that by turning

129
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,310
the model over. And you'll notice that
it's a similar shape to a Sonobe unit.

130
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,240
So what we want to do from here is fold
this top right corner over to the top

131
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,900
left corner. So we're going to carefully
fold all the layers over to the left

132
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,830
like this until both of those points are
aligned. And you want to make your crease

133
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,940
through all layers except for this outer
layer here because, as you can see from

134
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,839
the side, we want to keep that layer
curved. And once you've made that crease

135
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,459
all the way through then you can unfold. Then we're going to rotate the paper 180

136
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:38,300
degrees and do the same exact thing. So
again we're going to fold the top right

137
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,110
corner over to the top left corner and
we're going to carefully fold over all

138
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,279
layers just like this. Then you can make
your crease through all layers except

139
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,029
for that outer layer because again we
want to keep that curved. Then you can

140
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,720
unfold and turn the model back over. And
this

141
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:02,449
is one completed unit. Now you must fold
five more. And once you fold at all six

142
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:06,920
units, you're going to need two to start
the assembly. Then look at one and you'll

143
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,550
notice that it has a triangular flap
like this on each side and it also has a

144
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,839
pocket underneath these curved layers
here on each side. So once again we're

145
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,589
going to take our second unit, and what
we want to do is insert the second unit's

146
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:23,120
flap inside of the first unit's pocket. And we're going to do that by lifting up

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,870
both units and then we carefully want to
bring them together, again making sure

148
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,860
that the second unit's flap goes inside
of the first unit's pocket. Then we just

149
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,500
want to push the two units together
until they're completely aligned at the

150
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,550
top and the bottom. And now you've
connected the first two units. Then we're

151
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,129
going to slightly rotate the model so
that we're looking at the front face of

152
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,990
the second unit, and then we want to add
a third unit the same way. So once again

153
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,800
we're going to insert the third unit's
flap inside of the second unit's pocket

154
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,029
just like we did before. So we're going
to lift up all three units and then we

155
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,060
want to bring the second and third units
together, again making sure that the

156
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,769
third unit's flap goes inside of the
second unit's pocket as far as it'll go.

157
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,199
Then you just want to push the two units
together until they're aligned at the

158
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:06,949
top and the bottom. And now you've
connected three units. And now we want to

159
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:09,709
connect the first and third units
together. So we're going to slightly

160
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,889
rotate the model so that we're looking
at the front face of the third unit here.

161
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:16,550
And then we want to insert the first
unit's flap inside of the third unit's

162
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,759
pocket just like we've been doing. So
we're simply going to lift the first

163
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,209
units flap out from behind and we're
carefully going to tuck it inside of the

164
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,439
third unit's pocket just like we did
before. So you carefully want to bring

165
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,290
the first and third units together, and
you want to push them together until

166
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,339
they're completely aligned. And if you
turn the model over, you can see that

167
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,550
we've already assembled half the cube. So
we just have to add the other three

168
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,970
units the same exact way. So we're just
going to turn the model back over and

169
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,540
then you can pick any of the three units
to work with. I'm going to pick this

170
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,019
third unit here that we just added, and
I'm going to rotate the model so that we

171
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,589
can see the front face of that unit. And
then you'll notice this open pocket on

172
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:54,379
the right side of the third unit. And
that's where we're going to add our

173
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:58,189
fourth unit. So we're simply going to
insert the fourth unit's flap inside of

174
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:02,120
the third unit's pocket just like we've
been doing. So just bring the two units

175
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,240
together like this until they're
completely aligned. Then we're going to

176
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,260
slightly rotate the model so that we can
see the

177
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,490
face of the fourth unit. And you'll see
this unused flap on the left. And what we

178
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,420
want to do is tuck that flap inside of
the open pocket on the fourth unit. So

179
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,560
we're just going to bring those two
units together, just like we did before,

180
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,310
by inserting the flap inside of the
unused pocket. And just like that you can

181
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,150
see we've added another side to the cube. So if you slightly rotate the model, you

182
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,660
can see the four faces of the cube that
we already assembled. And from here we're

183
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,140
going to add a fifth unit the same way. So what we want to do is start by

184
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,650
inserting the fifth unit's flaps inside
of these two unused pockets on the other

185
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,620
part of the model. So we're carefully
going to bring those three units

186
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,640
together, just like this, by inserting the
fifth unit's flaps inside of the unused

187
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:52,950
pockets. And just like that we added
another face to the cube. And then you'll

188
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,310
notice this unused flap which we can
insert into one of the open pockets on

189
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,790
the fifth unit. So we're carefully going
to bring those two units together, just

190
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,020
like we did before, by carefully sliding
that flap inside of the fifth unit's

191
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,280
pocket just like this. And we want to
bring all of the units together until

192
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,000
they're completely aligned. And then if
you slightly rotate the model, you'll see

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,570
we've connected five faces of the cube. So we just need to place the sixth unit

194
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,100
down on top. And what we want to do first
is insert the sixth unit's flaps inside

195
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,760
these two unused pockets here. So we're
just going to place the sixth unit down on

196
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,390
top while inserting its flaps inside of
the unused pockets on the rest of the

197
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,560
model. So we're just going to bring all
the units together, just like this, until

198
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,340
they're completely aligned. And now we
simply have to insert these two unused

199
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,090
flaps inside of the open pockets on the
sixth unit. So we're just going to

200
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,420
carefully insert those flaps inside the
sixth unit's pockets just like we've been

201
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,180
doing. So we're going to do that on both
sides. Again make sure all of the units

202
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,230
are completely aligned, and now we've
connected all six units. But we want to

203
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,560
slightly rotate the model and you'll see
these points here where three units come

204
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,520
together, and you'll see these three
loose layers of paper. And basically what

205
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,790
we want to do is curl those layers of
paper just to give the model a more

206
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,900
organic shape. It may help to use some
kind of folding tool or a skewer just to

207
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,840
make it a little bit easier, but you can
continue this on all sides of the model.

208
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,239
And once you've done that on all sides,
then your origami Royal Rose Cube is

209
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:27,529
complete. I hope you've enjoyed this
