<think>
Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to plan a safe path for the snake's head from (6,5) to eat an apple at (3,3). Let me start by understanding all the given information and constraints.

First, the snake's current state is:
- Head at (6,5)
- Direction: RIGHT
- Body cells: [(5,5)] which means the tail is currently at (5,5), since the body list goes from behind to the tail. Wait, actually, no—the body list includes all segments except the head, starting with the one immediately behind. So if the snake's body is [B1, B2,... BN], then the full snake S is [HEAD, B1, B2,... BN]. Therefore, the current body cells provided are [(5,5)], meaning that the tail is at (5,5), and the segment before it is also (5,5) because the list only includes from behind. Wait, that might be a point of confusion.

Wait no—the Body cells list excludes the head and goes from the immediate behind to the tail. So if the body list has [(5,5)], then the snake's full body is [HEAD (6,5), (5,5)]—so the tail is at (5,5). That makes sense.

The apple is at (3,3).

So currently, the snake can't move into a position that would cause it to collide with its own body. Since the only other cell occupied by the snake is (5,5), which is far from the head's current position of (6,5). The direction is RIGHT, so initially, moving right seems possible.

Wait, but let me think: if the snake moves RIGHT, the new_head would be (7,5). Is that safe? Let's check:

- Is it within bounds? Yes, since 0 ≤ x,y <10.
- Does it collide with any body cell except possibly when moving into a position where the tail will not be—wait, during normal movement, if the new_head is not on any other body segments (excluding cases where the snake is growing), then it's safe.

In this case, the current body cells are [(5,5)], so moving to (7,5) doesn't collide with anything. Then, after moving, we add the old head position (6,5) at the front of the body list, and since it's not eating an apple, remove the tail (5,5), resulting in a new body list [(7,5)]. So the snake would then be [ (7,5), (6,5) ].

Wait, no: the movement steps say that when inserting old head into the front of the body list and removing the last element if not eating apple. The current body is [ (5,5) ], so after moving RIGHT, insert 6,5 as the new front, making the body [(6,5), (5,5)], then remove the tail (5,5). So now, the snake's body becomes [(6,5)]. Wait, that can't be right because we have to keep the continuity. Let me re-examine.

No, wait: in step 3a, insert old head into the front of the BODY list. The current body is [(5,5)], so after moving RIGHT and adding (6,5) at front, it becomes [(6,5), (5,5)]. Then step 3b: if not eating apple, remove last element—so we get [(6,5)].

But that's just the head. So now the snake is length 1 again. That seems possible because in the case of a snake with no body (body list empty), you can move directly toward the apple.

Wait, but after moving RIGHT once, and then removing the tail if not eating an apple—so the body becomes [(6,5)]. Then next step would be to have only the head again. Hmm, that seems possible, but I need to ensure movement rules are followed correctly.

But let's proceed with planning a path towards (3,3) from (6,5). Since we're at (6,5), direction is RIGHT, so initial move could be right or maybe down or left? But the current direction is RIGHT, which might mean that in step 1, the snake tries to move RIGHT first.

Wait, but according to movement rules: step 2 says "Check for collisions using the state before body shifts"—so when moving, after computing new_head, check if it's out of bounds or colliding with any body cells (except maybe if about to eat an apple). So let's see:

Current state:
Head is at (6,5)
Body cells are [(5,5)]
Direction is RIGHT

So possible moves: RIGHT would take head to (7,5), which is free. Left takes it to (5,5), but that's where the body cell is—so collision. Up would go to (6,4); down to (6,6). Let me see:

- Moving LEFT from (6,5) goes to (5,5)—body cell exists; so invalid.
- RIGHT: (7,5)—empty? Yes, because body cells are [(5,5)]. So valid move. But wait, moving right is allowed if it doesn't collide with the current body except for when eating apple.

Wait no—the rule says that during collision check, if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's position after movement, which hasn't moved yet. Wait, because in step 2 of movement update rules:

Check for collisions (using state before body shifts). So the tail is still at (5,5) when checking for collision.

So moving RIGHT to (7,5): no collision with (5,5), so it's allowed. Then after moving, we add old head (6,5) at front of body list [(5,5)], making body [ (6,5), (5,5) ], then remove the tail—so new body is [(6,5)]. So now, snake becomes just the head again.

Wait, but that might be dangerous because it's length 1. Next move—if moving further RIGHT from (7,5)—new_head would be (8,5). Check: (8,5) vs current body which was [ (6,5), (5,5) ]—no collision, so allowed. Then after movement, add head at front [(8,5)], and remove tail. So now snake is just the head again.

But this seems like it's not making progress towards (3,3). Maybe moving in a different direction first would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN from (6,5) to (6,4): check for collision—current body cells are [(5,5)], so no collision. So allowed. Then after movement, insert head at front of body list: [ (6,4), (5,5) ], then remove tail if not eating apple.

Wait, because when moving down from (6,5) to (6,4), the new_head is (6,4). The current body cells are [(5,5)], so no collision. Then we insert old head (6,5) at front of body list: [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Since not eating apple, remove last element—so body becomes [ (6,5) ].

Wait again, that's similar to before—the snake would become length 1 after the first move. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe in step 3b when moving down and not eating an apple, we have to subtract one from the body list, which goes from [(5,5)] → [ (6,5), (5,5) ] → remove last element gives [ (6,5) ].

So perhaps it's better to move in a different direction initially. Let me think about moving LEFT or RIGHT first and see how that affects the body.

Alternatively, maybe making sure not to turn around immediately since current direction is RIGHT, so can't reverse on first move.

Wait, according to movement rules: cannot reverse. So if current direction is RIGHT, next move can't be DOWN or LEFT? Wait no—rules say:

"2. Cannot reverse: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed."

So if current direction is RIGHT, the next move can be UP or DOWN? Or wait—no, rule 2 says cannot reverse between LEFT and RIGHT. So from RIGHT, you can't choose LEFT as next direction.

But directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, NONE. So perhaps from RIGHT, can I only choose RIGHT, UP, or NONE in the next move?

Wait no: rule 2 says "you may not choose" reverse. So for example, if current is RIGHT, you cannot choose LEFT as next direction. Similarly, if current is LEFT, you cannot choose RIGHT.

So from RIGHT, allowed directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN, and NONE—no, actually the exact wording is: "you may not choose 'DOWN' next" if current is RIGHT? No—it's more precise:

From rule 2:
- If current direction is "UP", can't choose "DOWN"
- If current is "LEFT", can't choose "RIGHT"

Wait no—the rule says that you cannot reverse between LEFT and RIGHT, meaning from RIGHT, you can't move LEFT next; similarly for others.

So in this case, with current direction RIGHT, next directions allowed are UP, RIGHT, DOWN, or NONE? Wait, no: the rule is about immediate reversal. So if current direction is RIGHT, you can't choose LEFT as the next direction; but other directions (UP, DOWN) are allowed.

Wait actually, re-reading rule 2:

"2. Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", cannot choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So from RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT; from LEFT, can't move RIGHT next; others (UP and DOWN) are allowed.

So in this case, after moving RIGHT once—current body cells becomes [(6,5)], direction is still RIGHT? Or does the snake change direction based on what's ahead?

Wait no—the movement step seems to only adjust the head position and then update the body. The direction remains as per the command given (or perhaps changes if needed). Wait no: in rule 2, it's about not reversing—so for example, if you're going RIGHT now, next move can't be LEFT.

But once you choose a new direction based on what makes sense, that would change your movement vector. So after moving RIGHT once to (7,5), the snake is length 1 again. Then in the next step, perhaps it's better to turn UP or something else.

Wait but this seems like getting stuck because every move either keeps the body at one cell or causes a collision unless we make specific moves.

Alternatively, maybe I need to plan multiple steps ahead and see how the body grows as the snake moves towards the apple.

But since the snake starts with only two segments—head (6,5) and tail (5,5)—maybe moving in such a way that it extends its body correctly without colliding is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps starting by moving DOWN to (6,4), then extending the body upwards as it moves. Let's see:

Current state:
Head: (6,5)
Body cells: [(5,5)]
Direction: RIGHT

Possible first move options not violating collision rules:

- Move RIGHT to (7,5): allowed since current body is [(5,5)], no collision.

After moving RIGHT, the new head is (7,5). Then step 3a adds this to the front of the body list [ (5,5) ] → new body list becomes [ (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) ]. Wait no: according to movement update rules:

Step 3a: insert old head at front.

So current body is [(5,5)], which includes all segments except the head. When moving RIGHT, inserting old head (6,5) into front of this list gives [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Then step 3b: since not eating apple, remove last element—so new body becomes [ (6,5) ].

Wait that's what I had earlier. So after moving RIGHT once and then removing the tail, snake is back to just head at (7,5). Hmm, but how?

No—the movement update rules say:

After step 2: compute new_head (7,5)

Check for collision with existing body cells [(5,5)]: no collision.

Then proceed to step 3a: insert old_head (6,5) into the front of the body list. The current body is [(5,5)], so after inserting, it's [ (6,5), (5,5) ].

Step 3b: since not eating apple, remove last element—so new body becomes [ (6,5) ].

Wait that means moving RIGHT once makes the snake just have head at (7,5). But how? Because we added a segment in front but then removed it. That seems incorrect because after moving, the body should now be longer by one if not growing. Wait no: when you're not eating an apple, you remove the tail.

Wait initial body is [ (5,5) ] which is from behind to tail—so the tail is at (5,5). When we move RIGHT and add head (6,5), then before removing tail, the new body list would be [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Then step 3b: if not eating apple, remove last element, so body becomes [ (6,5) ].

Wait that's strange because adding a segment at front and then removing it as a result of movement without growth. So in effect, the snake is just moving forward without growing until it eats an apple.

But when you move RIGHT once from head (6,5), new_head is (7,5). Then insert old_head into body list: [ (6,5), (5,5) ], then remove last element—so [(6,5)] becomes the body. So now, snake's head is at (7,5), and it's alone again.

This seems problematic because each time you move without growing, you end up with just a single cell, making any further movement difficult as you can't extend your body to avoid collisions.

Therefore, perhaps it's better to consider moving down or left first in the initial steps to allow for possible extension of the body towards the apple.

Wait but current direction is RIGHT. So rule 2 says that from RIGHT, cannot choose LEFT next; so maybe moving DOWN could be an option if allowed by collision checks.

Let me try moving DOWN from (6,5) → new_head (6,4).

Current body cells: [(5,5)]—so no collision with (6,4). So move is allowed.

After moving down to (6,4), step 3a inserts old head (6,5) into front of the body list [ (5,5) ] → new body list [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Step 3b: since not eating apple, remove last element—so new body becomes [ (6,5) ].

Again, same problem as before. So snake is now at head (6,4), with no body, so can't move in any direction without starting to build the body again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body list changes when moving. Because when you insert a new segment into the front and then remove one from the end, the net effect is that the snake's length remains the same as before movement—because you add one and remove one.

But in this case, since the initial body was [(5,5)], which has only one element (length 1). So after moving down to (6,4), step 3a adds head at front: [ (6,5), (5,5) ]—so length now is 2. Then step 3b removes last element → body becomes [ (6,5) ]. So net effect: no growth.

Hmm, so it's stuck again because the snake cannot grow until it eats an apple.

So perhaps to make progress towards (3,3), we need to find a path that allows for body extension. That would happen when moving into new positions without immediate collision and allowing the body to add segments.

Wait, but in initial steps, the snake's body is only [5,5]. So unless it moves into a position where after adding its head, there's an empty spot for the next segment, it won't grow. For example, if moving RIGHT from (6,5) would take it to (7,5), which doesn't collide with any existing body cells except perhaps when growing.

Wait no: current body is [(5,5)]. So adding head at front of that list and then removing the tail only gives a single segment again. Hmm.

Perhaps moving down first:

Move down from (6,5) to (6,4): no collision; then insert old head (6,5), remove last element → body becomes [6,5]. Same issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to make a series of moves that eventually cause the snake's body to extend in the direction towards (3,3). Let me try plotting possible steps.

Starting at (6,5):

Possible initial moves: RIGHT (7,5), LEFT (5,5)—but collision; UP (6,4); DOWN (6,6).

If I move UP first:

Head goes to (6,4). Check for collisions with body cells [(5,5)]: no. Then insert head at front of the body list: [ (6,5), (5,5) ]—then remove last element since not eating apple → new body is [ (6,5) ]. So same problem.

Wait, so regardless of initial move from position with body cell [(5,5)], adding a segment and removing it leads to single head again. Maybe the snake can't grow until it has at least two body segments beyond its head?

But wait, current body is only one cell—so unless after moving, we have more than one body cells.

Wait no: in this case, the initial body list is [(5,5)], which includes all segments except the head. So when you insert your old head into front of that list and then remove last element (since not eating), it's effectively replacing the tail with the old head position.

So maybe if we can move to a direction where after inserting the head, there are multiple body cells before removing the tail, allowing for some extension.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in such a way that when you add your head and remove the tail, the new body includes more segments, which allows movement towards (3,3).

But I'm getting stuck here because every initial move results in snake's body being just [head].

Wait, maybe it's better to make some moves without worrying too much about immediate collision but allowing for possible future growth.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a direction that would cause the snake to wrap around or something. But with the current position and apple placement, that might not be feasible.

Another idea: since the snake is of length 1 initially after each move (except when it's growing), maybe we need to make several moves without growth until it can start extending towards the apple.

But given the starting body cells [(5,5)], perhaps moving in a way that creates more body segments as needed. Let me try:

Starting at (6,5).

Move RIGHT: new_head=(7,5). No collision with current body [(5,5)]. Insert old head into front of body list → [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Remove last element since not eating apple → new body is [ (6,5) ].

Again, same issue. So that's not helpful.

Move UP: to (6,4). Same problem as before; snake becomes just [6,5].

Alternatively, maybe move in a different direction first and then adjust.

Wait perhaps the initial step should be moving LEFT from (6,5), but it collides with (5,5)—so can't do that. So only possible moves are RIGHT or DOWN or UP.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about how the snake can grow towards the apple by making a series of moves without immediate collision, allowing for new body parts.

Wait maybe it's better to plan ahead and figure out an expanding path from (6,5) towards (3,3). Since the initial position has only one body cell behind, perhaps moving in such a way that each step adds another segment, eventually leading towards the apple.

But how?

Let me try:

Start at (6,5).

First move: RIGHT to (7,5). Then insert old head into front of body list [(5,5)] → [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Remove last element → new body is [ (6,5) ].

Now snake's head is at (7,5), but no growth. So can't move towards the apple from here without first growing more.

So perhaps after moving RIGHT once and then growing again when possible.

Wait maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently: Since the body list only contains positions behind the current head, each time you move forward, you add a new segment at front of the list, but if not eating apple, remove last one—so effectively replacing the tail with your old head position.

So after moving RIGHT once:

Old body was [(5,5)] → insert (6,5) in front: [ (6,5), (5,5) ] → then remove last element: new body is [ (6,5) ]

Same issue as before. So the snake can't grow unless it eats an apple.

Therefore, maybe to make progress towards (3,3), we need to move without growing until a position where after moving and removing tail, the body extends beyond just one cell—so that there's at least two cells for growth in next steps.

Wait perhaps if we arrange moves so that each movement leads to adding more than one segment before starting to remove tails. But I'm not sure how that would happen since we can only add one per move and then remove one unless apple is eaten.

Alternatively, maybe make a series of movements where the head moves such that when you insert it into the body list, the list grows beyond its current length—so that after removing tail, there are multiple segments available for movement.

But with initial body being [(5,5)], which has only one segment, inserting another would make two segments. Then if not growing (since no apple), remove last → back to single head.

So perhaps this snake can't grow until it's longer.

Wait maybe the way out is that when moving in a certain pattern—like zig-zagging—it might allow for body extension beyond one segment after each movement.

But since I'm stuck, maybe think about alternative approaches or see if there's another path towards (3,3).

Alternatively, perhaps consider that from (6,5), the shortest distance to apple is moving up twice and left thrice: 6-3=3, so need to go up three times. But snake can't just move directly because of body collision.

But initial positions are such that we cannot grow until certain steps—so maybe plan a path where after some movements, snake grows into a position allowing it to reach (3,3).

Wait another idea: since the apple is at (3,3), which is three left and two up from current head. Maybe if I can create a path of empty cells that allows me to extend towards that point.

But given starting body cell at (5,5), moving RIGHT would take it to (6,5). Then from there, maybe move DOWN to (6,4), then LEFT once to (5,4), but checking for collisions each time.

Wait let's try this step by step:

Start: Head=(6,5), body=[(5,5)]

Move RIGHT to (7,5): allowed. After moving and updating, body becomes [(6,5)] as before.

Then move DOWN to (7,4): check if any collision with body cells? Body is now [(6,5)]. No collision. Insert old head (7,5) → new body list [ (7,5), (6,5) ]. Then remove last element since not eating apple: body becomes [(7,5)].

Now at (7,4). Not helpful; same problem again.

Alternatively, from (7,5), maybe move LEFT to (6,5): which is allowed? Because current body cells are [(5,5)], so no collision. Insert old head (7,5) → new body list [ (7,5), (5,5) ]. Remove last element: body becomes [ (7,5) ].

So snake moves back to (6,5). Useless again.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe the initial approach of trying to move step by step without considering growth isn't working because each movement only results in a single head cell unless we find a way to make multiple segments before needing to eat an apple.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when moving towards (3,3), there's no immediate path for the snake to extend beyond one segment, so maybe it's better to try a different approach altogether—like not starting with RIGHT but another direction first to allow growth.

Wait if we move UP from (6,5) → (6,4). Body becomes [ (6,5) ] as before. Then move LEFT: can't because body is [(6,5)], so collision at (5,5)? No, wait current position after moving up is (6,4), and the body cells are [(6,5)].

Wait no: original body was [(5,5)]. When I moved UP to (6,4), I added my old head (6,5) into front of [ (5,5) ] → new body list becomes [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Then remove last element since not eating apple → body becomes [ (6,5) ].

So now at (6,4). Next move: LEFT to (5,4).

Check for collision with body cells [(6,5)]: no collision. Insert old head (6,4) into front of the body list → new body list is [ (6,4), (5,5) ]? Wait no—inserting in front means adding after the current head.

Wait perhaps I'm confusing how the body list works. Current state before moving:

Head: (6,4)
Body cells: [(6,5)] because when you were at (6,5), moved to (6,4). Then inserted old head into front → [ (6,5) becomes first element? Wait no—wait step 3a is inserting the previous head position before the body list. So if current body is [B1], then new body after insertion would be [previous_head] + B1.

So from moving UP to (6,4), new_body_list = old_head + [ (5,5) ] → [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Then step 3b: remove last element since not eating apple → [ (6,5) ].

Therefore, after moving up and then processing movement:

Head is now at (6,4). Body cells are [ (6,5) ], so next move to the left would be from (6,4) to (5,4).

Now check if (5,4) collides with any body cells: no collision since body is [(6,5)].

Insert old head into front of body list → new_body_list = [ (6,4), (6,5) ]. Then step 3b: remove last element → [ (6,4) ].

Now snake's head is at (5,4). Body cells are empty again. So same problem as before—snake can't grow unless it eats an apple.

This suggests that any initial move from the starting position only allows for a single segment after movement until growth occurs through eating apple.

But since there's no apple yet, maybe this indicates that the snake needs to first reach a position where it can eat the apple and then use that to grow longer.

So perhaps plan is: move towards (3,3) in such a way that eventually reaches (5,4), allowing for growth when moving into the apple.

Wait but wait—(5,4) is one of the body cells. So if I'm at (6,4) and want to move LEFT to (5,4)—that's collision with tail which is at (5,5). Wait no—the current position after moving up was (6,4), body list [ (6,5) ].

If I try to move LEFT from (6,4) → (5,4): check for collision. Current body cells are [(6,5)], so (5,4) is not in the body—safe to move.

So:

Move LEFT: new_head=(5,4). Check collisions with [ (6,5) ]: no collision. Insert old head into front of body list → new_body_list = [ (6,4), (6,5) ]. Then step 3b: since not eating apple, remove last element → [ (6,4) ].

Now snake is at (5,4), with body cells [ (6,4) ]. Now can I move further towards (3,3)?

From (5,4):

Possible moves: RIGHT to (6,4)—but that's the current position. Or LEFT again? Wait from (5,4), moving LEFT would be to (4,4). Let me check.

Move LEFT: new_head=(4,4).

Check collision with body [ (6,4) ]: no collision at (4,4). Insert old head into front of body list → new_body_list = [ (5,4), (6,4) ]. Then step 3b: remove last element since not eating apple → [ (5,4) ]

Now snake is at (4,4).

From here, moving RIGHT to (5,4): but that's the current position. Or move DOWN to (4,3):

Check collision with body cells which are now [(5,4)].

No collision at (4,3). So:

Move DOWN: new_head=(4,3)

Insert old head into front of [ (5,4) ] → new_body_list = [ (4,4), (5,4) ]

Step 3b: since not eating apple, remove last element → [ (4,4) ]

Now at (4,3).

Can move further:

Move DOWN again to (4,2):

Check collision with body [(4,4)]: no. So:

Move DOWN: new_head=(4,2)

Insert old head into front of [ (4,4) ] → new_body_list = [ (4,3), (4,4) ]

Step 3b: remove last element → [ (4,3) ]

Now at (4,2).

From here, move LEFT to (3,2):

Check collision with body [(4,3)]: no.

So:

Move LEFT: new_head=(3,2)

Insert old head into front of [ (4,3) ] → new_body_list = [ (4,2), (4,3) ]

Step 3b: remove last element → [ (4,2) ]

Now at (3,2). Now body cells are [(4,2)].

Can move further towards apple:

Move LEFT to (2,2): which is collision with? Body cell is at (4,2), so no. But wait, current head is at (3,2), moving left would be to (2,2).

But (2,2) might not have any body cells yet.

So:

Move LEFT: new_head=(2,2)

Insert old head into front of [ (4,2) ] → new_body_list = [ (3,2), (4,2) ]

Step 3b: remove last element since not eating apple → [ (3,2) ]

Now at (2,2). Body is [(3,2)].

Move DOWN to (2,1):

Check collision with body [(3,2)]: no. So:

Move DOWN: new_head=(2,1)

Insert old head into front of [ (3,2) ] → new_body_list = [ (2,2), (3,2) ]

Step 3b: remove last element → [ (2,2) ]

Now at (2,1). Body is [(2,2)].

Hmm. Now can move towards the apple:

Move RIGHT to (3,1):

Check for collision with body [(2,2)]: no.

So:

Move RIGHT: new_head=(3,1)

Insert old head into front of [ (2,2) ] → new_body_list = [ (2,1), (2,2) ]

Step 3b: remove last element → [ (2,1) ]

Now at (3,1). Body is [(2,1)].

Move RIGHT again to (4,1):

Check collision with body [(2,1)]: no.

So:

Move RIGHT: new_head=(4,1)

Insert old head into front of [ (2,1) ] → new_body_list = [ (3,1), (2,1) ]

Step 3b: remove last element → [ (3,1) ]

Now at (4,1). Body is [(3,1)].

Move RIGHT to (5,1):

Check collision with body [(3,1)]: no. So:

Move RIGHT: new_head=(5,1)

Insert old head into front of [ (3,1) ] → new_body_list = [ (4,1), (3,1) ]

Step 3b: remove last element → [ (4,1) ]

Now at (5,1). Body is [(4,1)].

Move DOWN to (5,2):

Check collision with body [(4,1)]: no. So:

Move DOWN: new_head=(5,2)

Insert old head into front of [ (4,1) ] → new_body_list = [ (5,1), (4,1) ]

Step 3b: remove last element → [ (5,1) ]

Now at (5,2). Body is [(5,1)].

Move RIGHT to (6,2):

Check collision with body [(5,1)]: no. So:

Move RIGHT: new_head=(6,2)

Insert old head into front of [ (5,1) ] → new_body_list = [ (5,2), (5,1) ]

Step 3b: remove last element → [ (5,2) ]

Now at (6,2). Body is [(5,2)].

Wait this feels like I'm going in circles and not getting closer to the apple. Maybe there's another approach here.

Perhaps instead of moving directly towards left and down, find a way that allows growth when necessary. Let me think: from (3,1), perhaps moving up?

No—snake is at (3,1) with body [(2,1)]. Moving up would take it to (3,0), which is off the grid or into negative coordinates maybe.

Alternatively, maybe instead of moving left all the way, find a path that eventually allows for longer growth.

Wait perhaps from (5,4), when I had moved there earlier and was at [ (6,4) ], then tried moving LEFT to (4,4), but could that be adjusted?

But in any case, this trial-and-error approach is taking too long. Maybe the key is to realize that since the snake can't grow until it eats an apple, perhaps we need to make a series of moves that eventually lead into eating the apple at (3,3). So let's consider moving towards (3,3) while ensuring that after certain steps, the body extends enough.

But from starting position (6,5), trying to reach (3,3) directly is blocked by the initial body cell at (5,5)—so need to create a path around it or through it once apple is eaten.

Alternatively, maybe the first move should be towards eating an apple—wait but there's no apple yet. So perhaps moving into (4,5), which might not be blocked by any body cells?

Wait if I can find a way to get into position where after some movements, snake can reach the apple cell at (3,3).

Alternatively, think about how many steps are required and plan accordingly.

Given that the apple is at (3,3) and starting from (6,5), the shortest path would require moving left three times and up two times—so total of 5 moves. But considering the body's initial position blocks some paths, need to find a way through.

But since each movement only allows single head with no growth unless apple is eaten, perhaps it can't be done in those five steps. So maybe longer path needed involving eating an apple at certain point.

Wait but how? Because initially there's no apple—so snake has to move without growing until it reaches a position where the next step includes the apple and allows for expansion.

This seems complicated. Maybe instead of focusing on each individual movement, think about what needs to happen when moving towards (3,3):

To get from (6,5) to (3,3), need to go left three times and up two times—total 5 steps—but along the way, snake has to navigate around or through any body cells.

But starting position is with a body cell at (5,5). So moving LEFT to (5,4)—no collision. Then maybe move LEFT again to (4,4), but that leaves (3,4) open for next step.

Wait let's try:

Start: head=(6,5); body=[(5,5)]

Move LEFT to (5,4): allowed since not colliding with (5,5). Insert old head into front of [ (5,5) ] → new_body_list = [ (6,5), (5,5) ]; then remove last element because not eating apple: body becomes [(6,5)].

Now at (5,4); can move up to (5,3): allowed. Insert old head into front of [ (6,5) ] → new_body_list = [ (5,4), (6,5) ]; then remove last element since not eating apple: body becomes [(5,4)].

Now at (5,3); can move LEFT to (4,3): allowed. Insert old head into front of [ (5,4) ] → new_body_list = [ (5,3), (5,4) ]; then remove last element: body becomes [(5,3)].

At (4,3). Now, moving up:

Move UP to (4,2): check collision with [ (5,3) ]. No. Insert old head into front → new_body_list = [ (4,3), (5,3) ]; then remove last element: body becomes [(4,3)].

Now at (4,2). Move LEFT to (3,2): allowed. Insert old head into front of [ (4,3) ] → new_body_list = [ (4,2), (4,3) ]; step 3b: body becomes [(4,2)].

At (3,2). Now can move up:

Move UP to (3,1): allowed. Insert old head into front of [ (4,2) ] → new_body_list = [ (3,2), (4,2) ]; then remove last element: body is [(3,2)].

Now at (3,1). Now can move RIGHT:

Move RIGHT to (4,1): allowed. Insert old head into front of [ (3,2) ] → new_body_list = [ (3,1), (3,2) ]; step 3b: body becomes [(3,1)].

At (4,1). Move RIGHT again:

Move RIGHT to (5,1): allowed. Insert old head into front of [ (3,1) ] → new_body_list = [ (4,1), (3,1) ]; step 3b: body is [(4,1)].

Hmm, this seems like it's not progressing towards the apple. Maybe I need to backtrack or find a different path.

Alternatively, from (5,4), after moving LEFT twice and up once—maybe another approach:

From (5,4):

Move UP to (5,3): allowed as before.

Then move RIGHT to (6,3): allowed since body is at (5,3). Insert old head into front of [ (5,3) ] → new_body_list = [ (5,4), (5,3) ]; step 3b: body becomes [(5,4)].

Now at (6,3). Can move RIGHT again? But that's towards the apple, but let me see:

Move RIGHT to (7,3): probably out of bounds or maybe beyond. Alternatively, move DOWN.

Alternatively, from (6,3), moving down would be to (6,2):

Check collision with body [(5,4)]: no.

So: Move DOWN → new_head=(6,2). Insert old head into front of [ (5,4) ] → new_body_list = [ (6,3), (5,4) ]; step 3b: remove last element since not eating apple. Body becomes [(6,3)].

At (6,2); move RIGHT to (7,2): maybe off grid.

Alternatively, move LEFT back towards previous positions but then stuck again.

This is getting too complex; perhaps there's a different way of thinking about this problem. Maybe instead of focusing on each step and possible collisions, think in terms of necessary conditions:

To reach (3,3), the snake must have enough space to maneuver around its initial body cell at (5,5). It may need to navigate through or under that cell when it's positioned correctly.

Wait—so if the apple is at (3,3), perhaps after moving left and up several times, the snake can get into a position where it wraps around (5,5) with its body.

But for that to happen, the snake would need to form a loop or have enough body segments to pass through.

Alternatively, maybe when the snake is at certain positions, moving upwards will allow it to cross over the initial body cell. Let's imagine: if the snake moves left three times from (6,5) to reach (3,5), then up two steps to (3,3). But wait—body cells are there.

But starting with a body cell at (5,5):

- Moving LEFT once to (4,5); no problem. Then again to (3,5); allowed.
Then move UP twice: from (3,5) to (3,4), then (3,3).

So let's see:

Start: head=(6,5); body=[(5,5)].

Move LEFT once → (5,5): no. Wait, initial position is at (6,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (5,5) which has a body cell—so can't do that directly.

Ah! So snake cannot move into the same column as its own body unless it's in front of it or behind.

Wait wait—I think I made a mistake. The initial body is at (5,5), so if the head is at (6,5) and moves LEFT to (5,5)—the current position would be at (5,5), but since that cell has a body part, it's blocked. Therefore, can't move directly into (5,5). So must find another way.

Therefore, moving from (6,5):

First step cannot be into (5,5) as there is already a body cell.

So need to go up or right instead? Wait no—right would take you further away.

Wait only option initially is to move left or down. Let me correct that:

From starting position (6,5), the adjacent cells are:

- LEFT: (5,5): has body part → can't move there.
- UP: (6,4)
- RIGHT: (7,5) maybe beyond grid
- DOWN: (6,6) same

So only possible initial moves are UP or right.

Wait no—if the grid allows it—up is to (6,4), which is open. Right would be to (7,5)—but if that's off grid, then can't move there.

Assuming grid continues beyond those points, but perhaps better to think in terms of allowed moves.

But initial position: head at (6,5); body at (5,5).

So moving UP is possible since cell (6,4) is empty. Then inserting old head into front of [ (5,5) ] → new_body_list = [ (6,4), (5,5) ]; step 3b: remove last element because not eating apple → body becomes [(6,4)].

So at this point:

Head is at (6,4); body cells are [ (6,4) ]. Wait no—if you move UP to (6,4):

Old head was at (6,5). Insert into front of [ (5,5) ] → new_body_list = [ (6,4), (5,5) ]; then step 3b: remove last element since not eating apple. So body becomes [(6,4)].

So now you are at (6,4); body is [(6,4)]. Wait no—current head is at (6,4). Body cells were [ (5,5) ], and inserting new head in front then removing the tail would make it so that current position is (6,4), with body [(6,4)].

Wait this seems like we're stuck again. Because every time you move, your body grows by one segment at the front but loses one at the end—so each movement just moves the head without adding any new segments elsewhere unless apple is eaten.

So how can we get to (3,3) under these conditions?

Perhaps the key is that once a longer path is formed, it's possible to maneuver around the initial body cell. But I'm not seeing a clear path yet.

Another approach: calculate minimal number of moves required.

From starting position (6,5), apple at (3,3).

Assuming we can move in any direction except blocked by body cells:

But as body starts with single cell at (5,5), maybe need to create a pathway through it after moving around.

Alternatively, think that the initial step is into (6,4). Then from there, moving further up or left may be possible without colliding. But since each movement can only add one head and lose one tail unless apple is eaten, perhaps the snake has to move in such a way that it weaves through its own body.

Wait but the problem says "when you move," if not into an occupied cell, then your new head position becomes the previous front; and (2) when you eat an apple moving—so only possible when apple is present.

So unless there's an apple in (3,3), can't make any eating moves. So perhaps without an apple, snake cannot grow beyond one segment after each movement except for its initial body cell.

This suggests that the snake cannot progress further than a certain point without reaching the apple—so maybe it's impossible?

But since question asks if possible to reach (3,3), likely yes—it must have some path. Maybe I'm missing something in my earlier analysis.

Let me try another approach: imagine the snake moving up once from starting position:

Start at (6,5); body is [(5,5)].

Move UP → (6,4). Insert old head into front of [ (5,5) ] → new_body_list = [ (6,4), (5,5) ]; then remove last element because not eating apple. Body becomes [(6,4)].

Now at (6,4); body is [(6,4)]. Hmm—it's a loop?

Wait no—if I move from (6,4):

Next step: can move LEFT to (5,4). Insert old head into front of [ (6,4) ] → new_body_list = [ (5,4), (6,4) ]; remove last element. Body becomes [(5,4)].

Now at (5,4); body is [(5,4)]. Can move UP to (5,3): allowed.

Insert old head into front of [ (5,4) ] → new_body_list = [ (5,3), (5,4) ]; remove last element. Body becomes [(5,3)].

Now at (5,3); body is [(5,3)]. Can move UP to (5,2): allowed.

Insert head into front; then remove tail—body becomes [(5,2)].

At this point:

Head is at (5,2); body cells are [ (5,2) ].

Wait no—if you were moving up from (5,3), inserting new head would be (5,2). Body before was [(5,3)], so after insertion: [ (5,2), (5,3) ]; then remove tail—body becomes [(5,2)].

Thus, now body is at same position as head. Hmm.

Now from (5,2), can move LEFT to (4,2): allowed.

Insert old head into front of [ (5,2) ] → new_body_list = [ (4,2), (5,2) ]; remove last element—body becomes [(4,2)].

At (4,2); body is [(4,2)]. Move UP to (4,1): allowed.

Insert old head into front; then tail removal: body becomes [(4,1)].

Now at (4,1); move LEFT once to (3,1): allowed.

Insert into front of [ (4,1) ] → new_body_list = [ (3,1), (4,1) ]; remove last element—body becomes [(3,1)].

At (3,1); can move UP to (3,2). Insert old head into front; body becomes [(3,2), (3,1)]; then remove tail → body is [(3,2)].

Now at (3,2); can move RIGHT once—toward apple—to (4,2):

But wait, from position (3,2), moving RIGHT to (4,2)—body cell is there? Let me check the snake's body. Body was moved as [ (3,2) ] after previous step.

Wait this seems messy; perhaps it's better to try a different path.

Alternative idea: To get around the initial body at (5,5), maybe move towards higher x and y values first before moving up.

From starting position:

Move RIGHT once to (7,5): but if that's allowed. Then from there, move DOWN or LEFT etc.—but perhaps this leads away from apple location.

Alternatively, think of the snake as a linked list where each movement adds to front and removes from end—so to get past initial body cell at (5,5), need to have sufficient segments in front.

Wait maybe the snake can't pass through its own body unless it has multiple cells ahead. So until the snake's front passes beyond (5,5) into a new area, it cannot occupy that cell again for any movement.

But without knowing exact path, hard to tell.

Perhaps another approach: think of minimal steps needed and see if possible:

Snake needs to go from (6,5) → (3,3).

In terms of grid coordinates, difference is Δx= -3; Δy=-2. So straight line would be 5 units. But snake cannot do that as it's blocked by initial body at (5,5).

Thus, must find a path that weaves around the body.

Maybe move up first:

(6,5) → (6,4), then left to (5,4). Then down to (5,3); left again to (4,3); then perhaps up to (4,2); and so on until it can reach (3,3).

But without an apple to eat in between, the snake's body remains as single cell each time.

Wait no—when you move into a new position, you add that to front but remove from end. So starting at (6,5), moving UP to (6,4) gives body [(6,4)]. Then moving LEFT to (5,4); now body is [ (5,4) ]—but wait, no: after first move, head was (6,4), with tail at (6,5). Then second step:

Move LEFT → new head is (5,4), previous front is (6,4). So new_body becomes [(5,4), (6,4)] and then remove last element. So body becomes [ (5,4) ].

Ah! So each movement just moves the snake's head without growing it in length unless apple eaten.

So to get past initial position at (5,5), you have to move into a direction that allows you to bypass it—probably needs two or more segments ahead of (5,5).

Therefore, perhaps after moving from (6,4) to (5,4); then to (4,4): allowed.

At this point:

After moving LEFT from (5,4), body becomes [(4,4)].

Then move UP → (4,3). Insert new head in front: [ (4,3), (4,4) ]; remove tail—body is [ (4,3) ].

Now at (4,3); can move LEFT to (3,3).

Ah! Now this is the apple location. So let's see:

From position (4,3):

Move LEFT → (3,3). Since body was [(4,3)], moving into (3,3) which isn't occupied yet.

Wait, but (3,3) is where apple is—so when you move there, if it's allowed. So step-by-step:

Starting at (6,5):

1. Move UP → (6,4); body becomes [(6,4)].
2. Move LEFT → (5,4); body becomes [(5,4)].
3. Move LEFT again → (4,4); but wait: current position is (5,4). Moving LEFT to (4,4) would add new head as (4,4), and tail is removed from [ (5,4) ]—so body becomes [(4,4)].

Now at (4,4).

4. Move UP → (4,3); body is [ (4,3) ].
5. Now move LEFT into (3,3): allowed as apple is here.

So snake can reach the apple in 5 steps? Wait but wait—each step counts as movement, so from starting position to first up, then lefts...

Wait let's count:

1. Move UP: head at (6,4)
2. Move LEFT: head at (5,4)
3. Move LEFT: head at (4,4)
   But wait in the third step, after moving LEFT twice, from (6,4) → then to (5,4), then to (4,4). Each time, body is just single cell.

Wait no—after first move:

Start:
Head at (6,5); body [ (5,5) ].

Move UP: new head at (6,4); body becomes [(6,4)].
Then Move LEFT: new head at (5,4); body was [(6,4)], now after moving, insert (5,4), remove tail—body is [(5,4)].
Next move LEFT again: from (5,4) to (4,4); body becomes [ (4,4) ].

Then Move UP: new head at (4,3); body [ (4,3) ]. Then can move LEFT into (3,3): allowed. So apple is reached.

So total steps:

1. UP
2. LEFT → (5,4)
3. LEFT → (4,4)
4. UP → (4,3)
5. LEFT → (3,3)

Therefore, yes—snake can reach the apple in 5 moves.
</think>

The snake can indeed reach the apple by following these steps:

1. Move UP to (6,4).
2. Move LEFT twice to bypass around (5,5) and get to (4,4).
3. Move UP to (4,3), which is adjacent to the apple location.
4. Finally, move LEFT into the apple at (3,3).

**Answer:** Yes, it's possible for the snake to reach the apple at position $\boxed{(3,3)}$.
