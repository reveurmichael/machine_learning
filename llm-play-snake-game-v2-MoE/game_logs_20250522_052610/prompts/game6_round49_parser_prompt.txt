<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how the snake can move from (6,7) to eat the apple at (8,6). First, I'll start by understanding the current state of the game.

The snake's head is at (6,7), and it's currently moving UP. The body cells are [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So the body extends from the tail up to just below the head.

The apple is located at (8,6). I need to calculate the Manhattan distance between the head and the apple. The x-distance is 8-6=2, and y-distance is 7-6=1, so the total distance is 3 steps. But since the snake can't reverse direction immediately, that adds a constraint.

The current direction is UP, which means the next move can't be DOWN. So from (6,7), possible moves are RIGHT or LEFT, but wait, actually the movement rules say if the current direction is "UP", the next move cannot be DOWN. Wait no, rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. So since it's moving UP, next move can't be DOWN. But initially, when direction is NONE, any move is allowed.

Wait, the current direction is given as UP, so first move can't be DOWN because that would be reversing. So first possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP? Wait no, if you're moving in a certain direction, you can only change to other directions except the opposite. For example, if current direction is UP, next can't be DOWN.

Wait, according to rule 3: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If the direction is "NONE", any move is allowed. So in this case, since the current direction is UP, the next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP? Because those aren't the opposite of UP.

Wait no, actually the movement rules for directions are that you can change to any direction except the exact opposite. So from UP, you cannot go DOWN; you can go LEFT, RIGHT, or stay in UP (but I think the direction is determined by each move, so each move must be a new direction unless it's allowed). Wait no, when moving, each step is a direction change. So if current direction is UP, next move can't be DOWN.

So for the first move, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP? Or wait, maybe not. Because the initial direction is UP, but after that, you can't reverse. Wait no: The movement rules say you cannot reverse on the next step. So if current direction is UP, next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but moving in the same direction again might not make sense because each move changes direction). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let's clarify rule 3: The snake cannot reverse direction. E.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next. So from UP, the next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Or wait, movement is determined by the directions provided in each move step.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model each possible move and see what's allowed.

The head is at (6,7), direction is UP.

Possible moves:

- If we go RIGHT: x increases by 1. New head would be (7,7). But wait, the grid is 10x10, so that's okay.

But before moving, I need to check for collisions with body cells and walls.

Current body cells are [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So the body is a vertical line from x=6,y=3 up to y=6. Then it goes to (7,5) and (7,4), etc.

Wait, no: the body cells are listed in order, so starting from tail? Or from head?

Wait, the body cells list doesn't include the head, which is at (6,7). So the body starts with (6,3), then (7,3), up to (7,5), then (6,5), (6,6), and finally the head is at (6,7).

Wait no: in the snake's body, each cell represents a part of the snake. The order probably goes from tail to head. So when the snake moves, the tail may stay or move depending on whether it ate an apple.

But for collision detection, we need to ensure that after moving, the new head doesn't collide with any body cells (except possibly itself in the next step if it's part of the movement).

Wait, according to rule 4: The snake dies if it collides with its body. So when moving, the new head position must not be any of the current body cells.

So from (6,7), if we move RIGHT to (7,7): check if (7,7) is in the body cells? No, because the body cells are [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So no collision there.

Also, moving right would take us to x=7, y=7. Since y=7 is within 0-9, it's okay.

So first move could be RIGHT.

Alternatively, moving UP from (6,7) would take us to (6,8). Let's check if that's in the body: no. So that's also a possibility.

Wait, but we need to plan a path towards the apple at (8,6), which is two steps right and one step down from the head.

So the Manhattan distance is 3 moves, but considering movement constraints.

Let me try to plot possible paths.

Option 1: Move RIGHT first.

First move: RIGHT → (7,7). Now the direction is RIGHT. Next, we can't reverse back, so next move can't be LEFT.

From (7,7), need to reach (8,6).

So from (7,7) to (8,6): x needs to +1 and y -1.

But the apple is one step right and down.

Wait, but each move changes direction. So from RIGHT at (7,7), next move can be DOWN or any except LEFT.

If we go DOWN: (7,6). Check for collision with body.

After moving to (7,7) as head, the body would update:

- The previous head (6,7) becomes part of the body.
- Tail is removed unless apple is eaten. Since this move isn't eating an apple yet, tail is at (6,3), which will be removed when the next move happens.

Wait, no: after each move, the snake's body updates as follows:

New head = current head + direction.

Then, the previous head becomes part of the body (unless it's the last segment and the snake hasn't eaten). The tail is removed unless apple was eaten.

But in this case, since we haven't eaten the apple yet, the tail will be at (6,3), but after moving to (7,7), the body will include all previous cells except the tail, which would have been removed. Wait no: the body list given is before eating the apple. After each move without eating apple, the tail is removed.

So after first move (RIGHT) from (6,7) → (7,7):

Body becomes [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)]?

Wait no: I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

The body cells list in the input is [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So these are the positions excluding the head.

When the snake moves, the new head becomes the previous head + direction. The old head becomes part of the body, and if not eating an apple, the tail is removed.

So after moving RIGHT from (6,7) to (7,7):

- New head: (7,7)
- Body becomes [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)] → but wait, no. Wait, the body cells are all positions except the head.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each step:

Initial state:
Head: (6,7)
Body: [ (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]

First move: RIGHT → new head is (7,7). The body now includes the previous head at (6,7) as a new segment, and all previous body segments except the tail.

Wait no: when moving, the snake's body shifts. So if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed.

So initial body has 6 cells (excluding head). After moving, the new body would be:

[ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) ] plus the new head at (7,7).

Wait no: when you move, the snake's body is updated by adding the new head and removing the tail. So if the snake didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed.

So initial body cells are [ (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6) ] plus head at (6,7).

After moving right:

New head: (7,7)

Body becomes [ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) ]

Because the tail (6,3) is removed.

So now, body cells after first move are [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)].

Now, moving from (7,7):

Possible directions: can't reverse. Since previous direction was RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT.

So possible moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again? Wait no, movement is per step; each step's direction is given in the "moves" list. So after moving RIGHT once, the current direction becomes RIGHT for that step. The next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse direction from RIGHT to LEFT, which isn't allowed.

Wait, no: rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. For example, if going UP, can't go DOWN next. So in this case, after moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.

So from (7,7), possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

But our target is (8,6). From (7,7), we need to get there. Let's see:

From (7,7) to (8,6): x needs +1, y needs -1. So that requires a move right and then down, but each step can only go one direction.

Alternatively, first move DOWN to (7,6), then RIGHT to (8,6).

But let's check for collisions after moving from (7,7):

If we move DOWN: (7,6). Is this position in the body? The current body is [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)]. So (7,6) isn't present. So that's safe.

After moving DOWN to (7,6):

New head: (7,6)

Body becomes:

Previous body was [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)] → when moving down, the tail is removed. So new body is [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ].

Wait no: after each move, the snake's body includes all segments except the tail unless an apple was eaten. Since we haven't eaten the apple yet, the tail is removed.

So from initial body after first move: [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)].

When moving DOWN to (7,6):

- New head: (7,6)
- The previous head (7,7) becomes part of the body.
- Tail is removed: so tail was at (7,3), which is now gone. So new body is [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)].

Wait no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to model the movement step by step.

Each time the snake moves:

1. The new head is computed as current head + direction.
2. If the new head collides with any body cell or goes out of bounds, it's invalid.
3. All body cells (excluding the head) shift towards the previous head.
4. If the new head position was on an apple, the tail isn't removed; otherwise, it is.

So after first move:

- Head moves to (7,7).
- Body becomes [ (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6) ] → no, wait: when the snake moves right, the old head (6,7) is added to the body, and if not eating an apple, the tail is removed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the body as a list where each step adds the new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, let me think about whether moving RIGHT first is possible.

After moving RIGHT to (7,7), direction is now RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

From (7,7), next move options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

If I go DOWN from (7,7) → (7,6). Check if that's safe.

Current body after first move would include the previous head at (6,7). So body is [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)].

So moving to (7,6) from (7,7): not in body. Safe.

Now, after this move:

- Head is at (7,6)
- Direction is now DOWN.
- Next move can't be UP.

From here, need to get to (8,6). So next move could be RIGHT → (8,6).

Check if moving right from (7,6) would cause collision with body.

Body after second move: previous body was [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)].

Wait no: after first move, the body is [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)]. Then moving down to (7,6), the new head is added, and if not eating apple, the tail is removed.

So after second move:

Body becomes [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ] because we add the new head at (7,6) but remove the tail at (7,3).

Wait no: when moving from (7,7) to (7,6):

- New head is (7,6).
- Previous body was [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)].
- So the new body would be [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ] because we remove the tail at (7,3).

So now, moving from (7,6):

If I go RIGHT to (8,6):

Check if (8,6) is in body? Body is [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ]. No collision.

So third move: RIGHT → (8,6).

Now, after this move:

- Head is at (8,6).
- Since this was the apple's position, the tail isn't removed.
- So body becomes [ (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6) ].

Wait no: when you eat an apple, the tail remains. So the body is all previous segments including the new head but not removing the tail.

So after moving to (8,6):

- The body becomes [ (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6) ] because we add (8,6) as new head and don't remove the tail.

Wait no: perhaps when eating an apple, the body doesn't lose any segments. So each move adds a new segment at the head and keeps all existing ones.

But I'm getting confused again. Let's try to think differently.

Each time you move:

- If you eat an apple (i.e., land on it), your length increases by one.
- Otherwise, your tail is removed.

In our case, we only reach the apple at the last step.

So first move: RIGHT to (7,7) → no apple eaten. Body becomes shorter by one: [ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) ] with head at (7,7).

Wait, but initial body was [ (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]. After moving right, the new head is (7,7). The previous head (6,7) is added to the body. Then, since no apple eaten, tail (6,3) is removed.

So new body after first move: [ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) ].

Second move: DOWN to (7,6). No apple. So add (7,6) as head, previous head (7,7) is added, and tail (7,3) is removed.

New body after second move: [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ].

Third move: RIGHT to (8,6). This is the apple's position. So we eat it. Therefore, tail isn't removed. So body becomes [ (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6) ] and new head at (8,6).

Wait no: when eating an apple, the body doesn't lose any segments. So after moving to (8,6), the body is [ previous body without tail ] + new head? No.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a different approach.

Perhaps it's better to plan the moves in such a way that we can reach the apple without colliding with our own body.

So starting at (6,7):

Possible first move: RIGHT → (7,7).

Second move: DOWN → (7,6). Then third move: RIGHT → (8,6). This seems possible as no collisions occur in these steps.

But wait, after the second move to (7,6), what's the body?

After first move: body is [ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) ].

After moving down to (7,6):

- New head at (7,6).
- Previous head (7,7) added to body.
- Tail removed: tail was at (7,3), so now the body becomes [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ].

So when moving right from (7,6) to (8,6):

Check if (8,6) is in body. The body after second move is [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ]. No collision.

So this path works: RIGHT → DOWN → RIGHT.

But wait, each move changes the direction, so from first move RIGHT, next can't be LEFT. But after moving RIGHT to (7,7), then moving DOWN is allowed as it's not reversing.

Yes, that should be fine.

Alternatively, another approach could be:

First move: UP → (6,8). Then right twice. Let's see if that works.

But let's check collisions.

After first move: UP to (6,8).

Body after first move would be [ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) ].

From (6,8):

Next move could be RIGHT → (7,8). But we need to reach (8,6), which is two rights and two downs. Hmm, but this path might be longer.

Alternatively, moving down from (6,7).

First move: DOWN to (6,6).

But (6,6) is in the body? Yes, because initial body includes (6,5) and (6,6). So moving down would land at (6,6), which is part of the body. That's invalid.

So that path is not possible.

Another option: first move LEFT to (5,7), but then need to go right twice, but perhaps more complicated.

Alternatively, let's think about another initial move.

What if we move DOWN from (6,7) → (6,6). But as above, this lands on body cell (6,6), which is invalid.

So the only safe first moves are RIGHT or UP.

We've already considered RIGHT. Let's see UP.

First move: UP to (6,8).

Body after first move: [ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) ] with head at (6,8). Tail removed from (6,3).

From (6,8):

Possible moves: RIGHT, DOWN, or UP again.

But we need to get down to (8,6).

If I move RIGHT → (7,8).

Then RIGHT again → (8,8). Then DOWN to (8,7), then DOWN to (8,6). That's four moves, but let's see if it's possible without collision.

After first move: UP to (6,8). Body is [ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) ].

Second move: RIGHT → (7,8).

Body becomes [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8) ] because tail is removed.

Third move: RIGHT → (8,8). Body becomes [ (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,8) ].

Fourth move: DOWN → (8,7). Check if this is in body. The body after third move is [ (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,8) ]. So (8,7) isn't there. Safe.

Fifth move: DOWN → (8,6). Check if this is in body after fourth move:

After moving to (8,7):

- New head at (8,7).
- Previous head at (8,8) added.
- Tail removed: tail was at (7,5), so new body is [ (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) ].

So moving down to (8,6):

Check if (8,6) is in body after fourth move. The body is [ (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) ]. No collision.

Therefore, this path works but requires five moves: UP → RIGHT → RIGHT → DOWN → DOWN.

But the previous path with three moves seems shorter and better.

So the optimal path is:

1. Move RIGHT to (7,7)
2. Move DOWN to (7,6)
3. Move RIGHT to (8,6)

This way, we reach the apple in three moves without colliding with our own body.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple's location on a grid without colliding with itself. The goal is to determine the shortest path that allows the snake to reach the apple.

### Approach
The snake starts at position (6, 7) and needs to reach the apple at (8, 6). The key steps in solving this problem are:

1. **Identify Safe Moves**: From the starting position, only moves that do not land on the snake's own body are safe. Initially, moving RIGHT or UP are considered.
2. **Plan Path**: Calculate the shortest path by exploring possible moves and ensuring no self-collisions occur.
3. **Optimize for Shortest Distance**: Among all valid paths, choose the one with the fewest moves.

### Solution Code
```python
# The snake starts at (6, 7) and needs to reach (8, 6).
# Initial body positions are [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]
# Possible moves without colliding:
moves = [
    ('RIGHT', (7,7)),
    ('DOWN', (7,6)),
    ('RIGHT', (8,6))
]
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Position**: The snake is at (6, 7) with its body extending to (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), and (6,6).
2. **First Move**: Moving RIGHT from (6,7) to (7,7). This move does not land on any part of the snake's body.
3. **Second Move**: From (7,7), moving DOWN to (7,6). This move is safe as (7,6) is not in the current body positions.
4. **Third Move**: From (7,6), moving RIGHT to (8,6), which is the apple's location. This final move does not result in a collision.

This sequence of moves ensures that the snake reaches the apple in the shortest number of steps without colliding with its own body.
