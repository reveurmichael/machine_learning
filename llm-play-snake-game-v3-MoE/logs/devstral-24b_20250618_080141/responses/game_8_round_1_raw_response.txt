========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the given state and plan a path for the snake to reach the apple safely.

Here are the inputs:
- Head position: `(5, 5)`
- Current direction: `"NONE"` (can move in any direction)
- Body cells: `[]` (snake has no body segments yet)
- Apple position: `(9, 7)`

Since there's no body to worry about yet, we can plan a direct path toward the apple. The apple is at `(9, 7)`, and our head is at `(5, 5)`. We need to move right 4 times and up 2 times.

Let's create a safe path:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Since there is no body yet, I can plan a direct path to the apple by moving right 4 times and up 2 times."
}
```

This should be a valid solution according to the rules provided.
