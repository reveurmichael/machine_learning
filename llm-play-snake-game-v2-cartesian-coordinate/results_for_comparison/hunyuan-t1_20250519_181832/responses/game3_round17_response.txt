  "reasoning": "The snake must move left 7 times and up 3 times to reach the apple (1,6) from (8,3). Starting with LEFT moves avoids the initial DOWN direction restriction. The path navigates left away from the body's horizontal segment at y=8, then ascends upward avoiding collisions, ensuring net movement aligns with Manhattan distance requirements."
