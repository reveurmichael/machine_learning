========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,3) with direction DOWN. To reach the apple at (2,5), we need to move right and up. First, move RIGHT to (1,3) (safe, not colliding with body). Then move UP to (1,4) (avoiding body segments). Next, move UP to (1,5) (still safe). Finally, move RIGHT to (2,5) (the apple). This path avoids collisions, respects direction rules, and ensures a safe move after eating the apple."
