<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this classic Snake game problem where I need to find a safe path for the snake's head from (3,0) towards the apple at (4,7). Let me break down what I know and try to plan a route step by step.

First, let me note down the given information:

- Head is at (3,0).
- Current direction is "DOWN".
- The body segments are [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)].
- Apple is at (4,7).

The snake's current head position is (3,0). It's moving DOWN because the initial direction is given as such. But since it's about to move towards the apple, I think that might change.

I need to plan a series of moves without colliding with itself or getting trapped. The key here is to ensure that after each move, the snake doesn't intersect its own body except at the tail when necessary.

The goal is to reach (4,7), which is 1 unit right and 7 units up from (3,0). So in terms of Manhattan distance, I need a net movement of RIGHT once and UP seven times. But since each move affects both x and y coordinates, I have to plan the path carefully.

Let me first sketch out the current snake body:

Head: (3,0)
Body1: (3,1)
Body2: (3,2)
Body3: (3,3)
Body4: (3,4)
Body5: (3,5)

So the snake is vertical at x=3 from y=0 to y=5. It's currently facing DOWN because that's given as the initial direction.

Wait, no—the current direction is "DOWN", but in terms of movement, since it's moving towards where? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If the head is at (3,0) and the snake is going DOWN, then from (3,0), moving DOWN would take it to y-1 = -1, which is outside the grid. That can't be right because (3,0)'s y-coordinate is already 0, so moving DOWN would go out of bounds.

Wait a minute—that seems like an issue. If the snake's head is at (3,0) and it's facing DOWN, but trying to move DOWN from there would take it outside the grid. So maybe that was just initial state; perhaps after some moves, we can adjust direction.

But in this problem, I'm supposed to plan a sequence of directions starting from the given state until reaching the apple. So perhaps the initial direction is not "DOWN" anymore? Or did I misinterpret?

Wait no—the inputs specify the current direction as "DOWN". But since the head's position is (3,0), moving DOWN would take it out of bounds because y=0 -1 = -1 which is invalid.

This suggests that either there's a typo or perhaps the initial direction isn't towards the apple. Hmm.

But regardless, I think we can proceed by ignoring the current direction and just focus on planning the moves from (3,0) to reach (4,7), ensuring each step doesn't cause collision with body segments or itself.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "you are given" inputs including the current direction as DOWN. So perhaps we have to make sure that during movement, each subsequent move is valid according to the rules provided, especially regarding not reversing direction immediately.

But maybe I should just ignore this initial confusion and proceed with planning the path based on starting at (3,0) moving towards (4,7).

Let me map out possible moves:

From (3,0), since it's facing DOWN but that leads outside, perhaps first move can't be DOWN. So what are my options?

Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, UP.

Wait, according to the rules, if current direction is "DOWN", next direction cannot be "UP" because you cannot reverse immediately.

So from a direction of "DOWN", you can choose any except "UP".

But since moving DOWN would take it out of bounds, perhaps the first move should be RIGHT or LEFT to get towards x=4 and y increasing towards 7.

Wait, but in this case, (3,0) is at x=3. To reach x=4, we need one more step to the right. So maybe moving RIGHT once will bring us closer.

But then after that, from (4,0), I can start moving UP seven times to get y up to 7.

Wait, but let's see:

From (3,0):
- Move RIGHT → (4,0). Now facing RIGHT.
Then move UP six more times: each time y increases by 1. So:
(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7).

So that's a total of seven moves: one RIGHT and then six UPs.

But I need to check if this path is safe in terms of snake body segments.

The initial body of the snake:

Head at (3,0)
Body1: (3,1)
Body2: (3,2)
Body3: (3,3)
Body4: (3,4)
Body5: (3,5)

So if we move to (4,0), does that cause any collision? Initially, no. But as the snake moves up along x=4 from y=0 to y=7, it needs to make sure none of those positions are already occupied by its body.

Wait, but after moving RIGHT once, the new head is at (4,0). The body remains at [(3,1), (3,2), ..., (3,5)]. So no collision yet. Then when we start moving UP along x=4:

First move: (4,1)
Then (4,2)
...
Up to (4,7).

Each of these steps should be checked against the snake's body.

Wait, but after each move, the snake's body shifts forward except if it eats the apple. So from head at (3,0), moving RIGHT brings us to (4,0). Then the body becomes [(3,1), (3,2), ..., (3,5), (4,0)].

Wait no—the body after moving is:

Old HEAD: (3,0)
After inserting old head at front of BODY list:
BODY becomes [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]

But then when we move UP to (4,0):

Check for collision. The new head is (4,0). Check if it's in any BODY except the tail? No, because the current body includes (3,1) up to (3,5); none of these are at y=0.

So moving RIGHT once and then UP seven times should be safe?

Wait, but each time we move UP along x=4 from y=0 to 7:

After first move: (4,0), then (4,1), ..., up to (4,7). Each step needs to check if the new head is in any of the previous body positions except for the tail.

Wait, but after each move, the body shifts. So when moving from (4,0) to (4,1):

The snake's body would have been [(3,1), (3,2), ..., (3,5)] before the first move. After moving RIGHT once, the body becomes [(3,0), (3,1), ..., (3,5)]. Then when moving UP to (4,0), it inserts into front and trims tail:

Wait no—each step after a movement includes updating the body.

This is getting complicated. Let me try simulating each move step by step.

Initial state:
Head: (3,0)
BODY: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]
Direction: DOWN

Wait, but if direction is DOWN and we're at (3,0), moving DOWN would take us to y=-1 which is invalid. So first move can't be DOWN.

So the initial possible moves are RIGHT or LEFT or UP.

But since we need to go right towards x=4, let's try RIGHT first.

Move 1: RIGHT → new_head = (3+1, 0) = (4,0). Check collision:

Is (4,0) in any of the current body? The body is [(3,1), ..., (3,5)]. No. So move allowed. Now update the body:

Insert old head (3,0) at front → BODY becomes [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)].

Then check if new_head is apple's position? Apple is at (4,7). No. So remove tail: previous last element was (3,5). Now the body becomes [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)].

Now HEAD = (4,0).

Move 2: UP → new_head = (4,1). Check if in any body. Current body is [(3,0), (3,1), ..., (3,4)]. The new head is at y=1, which was previously Body5 at (3,5)—but after moving RIGHT once and then removing tail, the current body doesn't include (3,0) as a body cell except HEAD.

Wait no—the previous step: after move 1, the body becomes [(3,0), (3,1), ..., (3,4)] because we inserted (3,0) at front and removed last element.

So when moving UP to (4,1):

Check if (4,1) is in any of the current body except the tail? Current body after move 1:

[(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]

Wait no—that's incorrect. The body after move 1 includes the new head at (3,0). So when you move to (4,1), it is a new position not present in the current body.

So move allowed. Update the body:

Insert old head (4,0) → new BODY becomes [(4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)].

Then since it's not an apple, remove tail: last element is (3,4). Now body is [(4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)].

Now HEAD = (4,1).

Move 3: UP → new_head = (4,2). Check if it's in any of the current body positions except tail. Current body is [(4,0), (3,0), ..., (3,3)]. No collision.

Insert old head at front:

BODY becomes [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)].
Then remove tail: last element is (3,3). Now body is [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)].

Proceeding similarly:

Move 4: UP → (4,3)
Body becomes [(4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1)]
Move allowed.

Continuing this until we reach y=7.

Wait, but at each step, the body is getting shifted. The snake's previous positions are being pushed forward except when it eats something.

But in this case, since we're moving straight up along x=4 without eating anything else, each new head position (4,y) will be unique and not present in the current body.

Wait, but after some steps, does any of these y positions clash with previous body segments?

For example, when at (4,1), is that a problem? Because prior to move 2, the snake was along x=3. So as we shift forward each time, the new head should be unique because all the previous body parts are on x=3 or x=4.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe this path is safe.

Let me summarize:

From (3,0), move RIGHT to (4,0).

Then move UP seven times: each time y increases by 1 up to (4,7). Each step seems collision-free because the body's other parts are on x=3 and don't interfere with x=4 except for their initial positions.

But wait—when moving from (4,5) to (4,6), let's see:

Current head is at (4,5).

After move RIGHT once: new head is (4,0). Then move UP six times along y=0→1→2→3→4→5→6.

Wait no—the initial move was to (4,0) as the first step. Then moving up from there would take us through y=1 to y=7.

But after each move:

At (4,y), the snake's body is [(current head at x=4,y), followed by previous head parts].

So for example, when new_head = (4,5):

- Current body includes segments along x=3 and maybe x=4 if any have been added earlier.
Wait no—when moving to (4,0), the body becomes:

[(3,0) inserted at front], then [(3,1), ..., (3,5)] after trimming.

Then when moving UP once from there, it's inserting (4,0) and removing (3,5). So each subsequent move is adding a new segment in x=4 while keeping the body on x=3 except for the initial part that was just moved to x=4.

So as such, none of these positions should interfere with each other since they're all moving along separate y-values or different x-values.

Therefore, this path seems collision-free.

Thus, the sequence would be:

1. RIGHT
2. UP
3. UP
...
Up seven times after the initial move.

Wait no—actually, from (4,0) to (4,7), that's 6 moves of UP because you start at y=0 and need six increments to reach y=6, then one more step? Wait:

No—from y=0, moving up each time increases by 1. So from (4,0):

- Move 2: (4,1)
- Move 3: (4,2)
...
- Move 8: (4,7)

Wait, that's seven moves after the first move.

So total of eight moves?

Wait initial direction is "DOWN" but perhaps we can ignore it since moving DOWN from (3,0) would go out of bounds. So maybe all moves are:

1. RIGHT
2. UP × 6? No—wait: from (4,0), to reach y=7 requires seven UP moves.

So that's a total of eight moves?

But initial direction is "DOWN", but after moving RIGHT once, we start moving UP.

Wait, perhaps it's more efficient to plan the path as:

- Move RIGHT once
- Then move UP 6 times (from y=0 to y=7? Wait no—from (4,0) to (4,7), that's seven increments.)

But how does that reconcile with each step?

So initial direction is "DOWN", but since we can't move DOWN from there, our first move must be RIGHT.

Then proceed UP as needed.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

1. RIGHT
2. UP
3. UP
4. UP
5. UP
6. UP
7. UP

Wait—no—that's seven moves in total after the initial RIGHT. So eight steps including the first move? Or is it seven?

Wait starting at (3,0):

Move 1: RIGHT → (4,0)
Move 2: UP → (4,1)
Move 3: UP → (4,2)
...
Up until y=7.

From y=0 to y=7 requires moving UP six times. Wait no—moving from (4,0) to (4,1): first move after RIGHT is 1.
So to get to (4,7), you need seven moves: one RIGHT and then seven UPs? But that would be eight steps.

Wait:

- Move 1: RIGHT → y=0
- Moves 2-8: UP six times? No—if starting at y=0, moving up once takes us to y=1. To get to y=7 from there requires six more moves (total of seven). So total of eight steps.

But perhaps that's not necessary because each move after RIGHT is an additional step towards the target.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a shorter path by sometimes changing direction when it doesn't cause collision, thus making fewer steps.

Wait another idea: Instead of moving all the way to x=4 first and then up, maybe we can snake along. But given that the head needs to reach (4,7), which is northeast from its current position, perhaps moving right once and then straight up is the shortest path.

But let's confirm:

Total moves needed are 1 RIGHT + 6 UPs = 7 moves? Wait:

No: To go from x=3→4 (1 move) and y=0→7 (7 moves), total of 8 steps. But perhaps there's a way to reach the apple faster.

Wait, but if we can zig-zag in such a way that some UPs are done before moving further right? Maybe not necessary here since x is only increasing by one step needed.

Alternatively, maybe after some initial steps, you can move in another direction without causing collision. But given the current body positions, perhaps moving up along x=4 is the safest and shortest path.

So I think the plan is:

- Move RIGHT once to (4,0)
- Then move UP six times to reach y=6
Wait no—from (4,0) to y=7 requires seven moves of UP.

But wait: Moving from (3,0):

1. RIGHT → (4,0). Now facing right.
2. UP → (4,1)
3. UP → (4,2)
...
Each time checking for collision with the body.

Given that after each move, the new head is added to the front and tail removed if not eating apple, so none of these positions should conflict since the current snake's body along x=4 hasn't been occupied yet except at y=0 which was just moved from.

Wait, but initially, (3,1) is part of the body. After moving RIGHT once, the new head is (4,0). Then when you move UP to (4,1), that's a new position not present in the body because prior positions were along x=3 and y>=1.

Hence, this path seems safe.

So I think the sequence would be:

RIGHT → then six UPs: but no, from (4,0) to (4,7) is seven UP moves. Wait 0→1, 2,...,7 requires seven steps.

But since starting at (3,0), moving RIGHT once and then seven UPs would require eight total moves:

Move 1: RIGHT
Moves 2-8: UP ×6? No—let me recount.

Wait no—(4,0) is after move 1. Then each subsequent move of UP brings y up by 1:

Move 2: (4,1)
Move3:(4,2)
...
Move7:(4,6)
Move8:(4,7)

So eight moves in total?

But perhaps I can make it seven steps if the initial direction is considered. Wait no—the first move takes you to (4,0), then each UP is a separate step.

Wait, maybe my confusion arises from counting wrong. Let me just think of it as:

Start at (3,0).

Move 1: RIGHT → (4,0)
Now facing right. Next directions can be UP until reach y=7.

But to get from (4,0) to (4,7), you need seven UP moves.

Thus total moves are 8 steps? Or no—starting at step 1 after initial position:

Wait actually, moving RIGHT is one move, then each subsequent move is an UP. So if I have to make six UPs after the first move to get from y=0→6 (no), wait—if starting at (4,0):

To reach y=7 requires seven moves of UP because each move increases by 1.

Wait no:

(4,0) → (4,1): one UP
...
Up until (4,7) is reached after seven such steps. So yes, total moves would be eight: RIGHT once and seven times UP.

But perhaps this can be optimized—maybe sometimes moving in a different direction when it doesn't cause collision to reach the target faster?

Alternatively, maybe we can arrange some turns earlier on.

Wait another idea: Since from (3,0), moving right is necessary. Then after that, move up as much as possible without causing conflict with any previous body positions.

Since all prior segments are along x=3 and this new segment is along x=4, they shouldn't interfere.

Thus the path is straightforward.

So I think the sequence would be:

1. RIGHT
2. UP
3. UP
4. UP
5. UP
6. UP
7. UP

But that's seven moves after RIGHT? Or no—starting from (3,0), the first move to (4,0) is one step. Then moving up six times would reach y=6, and seventh time reaches y=7.

Wait no—it should take seven steps of UP: 1→8?

No, confusion arises because in programming or coding terms, array indices start at zero, but here it's a problem with physical positions.

But regardless, the number is eight total moves:

- Move 1: RIGHT
- Moves 2-8: UP six times? Wait no—that would take us from (4,0) to y=7 after seven steps. So in total, right once and then up seven times—eight moves?

Wait but each move changes the direction, so perhaps the sequence is:

RIGHT → UP ×6? Or wait:

No—each UP brings you one unit higher. Starting at (4,0), moving up six times gets to y=6, seventh time y=7.

Thus total of eight moves: right once and seven ups.

So I think that's correct.

But perhaps there is a way to reach faster by making smarter direction changes, but in this case, it seems the path is clear.

Therefore, the plan is:

- Move RIGHT
- Then move UP six times to reach y=6 (total of seven moves after right), then one more UP for y=7.

Wait no—it's eight total steps. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted because moving from (4,0) to (4,1) is the first UP move.

Thus:

Start at (3,0)
Move 1: RIGHT → (4,0)
Now facing right
Move 2: UP → (4,1)
Move 3: UP → (4,2)
...
Up until Move 7: UP ×6 brings to y=6?
Wait no—each move increases by one.

Thus:

- After move 1: (4,0)
- Move 2: (4,1) — first UP
- Move 3: (4,2) — second UP
...
Continuing until move seven: (4,6)
Move eight: (4,7)

Wait but that's only six UP moves after right. So total of seven moves.

Ah! Right. Because starting at y=0:

Each UP increases by one:
- Move 1 RIGHT → y=0 to y=?
No—it starts moving up from the new head position.

Wait perhaps it's better to model each step as follows:

Start: (3,0)
Move Sequence:
1. RIGHT → (4,0)
2. UP → (4,1)
3. UP → (4,2)
...
Up until after six more moves, we reach y=6? No—each move is one unit.

Wait let's do it step by step:

Start at (3,0), facing right.
After moving RIGHT once: position (4,0). Now, facing right.

Now to go up along x=4, each UP will take us higher in the y-axis. So starting from (4,0):

Move 2: UP → (4,1)
Move 3: UP → (4,2)
...
Each move is an increment of y by one.

To get from (4,0) to (4,7), how many moves? Let's count:

(4,0) [initial]
After Move 2: (4,1)
Move 3: (4,2)
Move 4: (4,3)
Move5:(4,4)
Move6:(4,5)
Move7:(4,6)
Move8:(4,7)

Thus, it takes seven UP moves after the initial RIGHT to reach y=7.

So total of eight steps:

1. RIGHT
2-8: UP ×7

But that's 8 moves in total.

Alternatively, since from (3,0), moving right once and then up seven times would be 8 moves? No—it starts at (4,0) after move 1, so each subsequent UP is a separate step. So to reach y=7, starting at y=0, it's seven UPs.

Wait confusion again—because initial position is (3,0), moving right takes you to (4,0). Then the first UP is from (4,0) → (4,1).

So the number of UP moves required is 7:

From y=0→y=7 requires seven increments. So starting at (4,0):

UP ×7 = y=7.

Thus total steps are: RIGHT once + UP seven times = eight moves.

But when I count step-by-step, from Move1 to Move8, that's correct because each move is a separate direction command. But perhaps the initial DOWN was unnecessary and we can proceed directly without any backtracking.

So in conclusion, the sequence of moves would be:

RIGHT
UP
UP
UP
UP
UP
UP
UP

That's eight steps total to reach (4,7) from (3,0).

But wait: Initially at (3,0), facing right. Then move RIGHT once is step 1.

Then moving UP seven times gets you to y=7 in seven moves.

So that's a total of eight steps, each changing direction as per the plan.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path if we can turn left or something else without causing collision, but I don't see any such opportunity here because the body along x=3 is fixed at lower y-values and moving up along x=4 doesn't interfere with that.

Therefore, this seems to be the correct plan.
</think>

The sequence of moves needed for the snake to reach the target position (4,7) starting from (3,0) without colliding with its own body is as follows:

1. Move RIGHT once
2. Move UP seven times consecutively

Thus, the final answer is a series of directions: right followed by seven ups.

\boxed{RIGHT, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP}
```
