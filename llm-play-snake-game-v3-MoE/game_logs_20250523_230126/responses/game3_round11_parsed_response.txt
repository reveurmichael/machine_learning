{"moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake can reach the apple at (4, 9) by moving UP to (5, 6), then LEFT to (4, 6), and DOWN three times: (4, 7), (4, 8), and (4, 9). The reasoning is that each move only affects a single new_head and removes other body cells, so no collision occurs because all other segments are either shifted out or removed."}
