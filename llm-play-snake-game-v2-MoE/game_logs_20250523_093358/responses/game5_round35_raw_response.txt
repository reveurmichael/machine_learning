========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the current game state to determine the best path for the snake to reach the apple while avoiding collisions and following all the movement rules.

Let's break down the information:

- **Current head position**: (1, 6)
- **Apple position**: (5, 9)
- **Current direction**: DOWN
- **Body cells**: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)]

First, I need to calculate the offsets required to move from the head's current position (1, 6) to the apple at (5, 9):

- To reach x=5 from x=1: We need RIGHT moves. Difference = 5 - 1 = 4
- To reach y=9 from y=6: We need UP moves. Difference = 9 - 6 = 3

So we need a total of:
- 4 RIGHT moves to increase x-coordinate by 4 units
- 3 UP moves to increase y-coordinate by 3 units

Let's plan the path while ensuring safety and following movement rules:

1. We start at (1, 6) moving DOWN.
2. As per constraints, we can't reverse direction initially.

Since the current direction is DOWN, we'll avoid going UP immediately and need to calculate a safe sequence of moves.

Let's consider potential paths and obstacles:
- From (1, 6), let's move RIGHT (x increases)
- Then UP (y increases)

The snake currently cannot go left because it would collide with its body [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)].

So the moves could be:
1. Keep moving DOWN until we can safely turn RIGHT
2. Move RIGHT and UP

Let's simulate this path step-by-step:

Starting at (1, 6):
- Current direction is DOWN.
- Let's move DOWN once to avoid immediate body collision.

From there, let’s analyze the grid more carefully:
```
(1, 6) -> DOWN -> (1, 5)
```

Now we can go RIGHT safely and then UP:
- From (1, 5): Move RIGHT until x=5
- Then UP from (5, 5) to (5, 9)

The safe path will be: DOWN → RIGHT × 4 → UP × 3

Let’s construct the JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move from (1,6) to (5,9) with a safe path avoiding body collision. First move DOWN once to avoid immediate collision, then RIGHT until x=5 and UP until y=9."
}
```

This plan ensures that the snake avoids colliding with its own body while heading towards the apple at (5, 9).
