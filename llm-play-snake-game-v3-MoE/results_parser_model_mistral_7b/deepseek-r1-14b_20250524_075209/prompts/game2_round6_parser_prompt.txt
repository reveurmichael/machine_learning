<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how the snake can get from (2,7) to (6,6). The current direction is UP, but I can't reverse immediately. So my first move can't be DOWN.

The head is at (2,7), and the body is [(2,6)]. The apple is at (6,6), which is a bit to the right and down from the head. Let's think about the path.

First, since I can't reverse, if I'm going UP now, my next move can't be DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or stay in the same direction (which would be UP again).

Looking at the current position, moving RIGHT seems promising because the apple is to the right. Let's see:

1. Current head is (2,7), body [(2,6)]. If I move RIGHT, new_head becomes (3,7). Check for collisions: The body is at (2,6), which isn't in the same row as the new head. So it's safe.

2. After moving right, the body will update by adding the old head (2,7) to the front of the body list, making it [(2,7)]. Then since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail, which is (2,6). Now the body is empty because the snake length remains 2. Wait, no—wait, initially, the snake's full S is [HEAD (2,7), BODY1 (2,6)]. So after moving RIGHT, the new head is (3,7), and the body becomes [(2,7)].

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated that. Let me recheck.

After moving to (3,7):

- Insert old head (2,7) into the body list, so it's now [BODY1: (2,7)].
- Since new_head is not eating apple, remove tail (the last element of body), which was (2,6). So body becomes empty.

Wait no—wait, the initial body after inserting old head would be [(2,7)], and since we didn't eat an apple, we have to check if we should remove the tail. But wait, the original body is [BODY1 (2,6)]. After moving, the new body list is [old head] + BODY, so it's [(2,7), (2,6)] before considering eating.

But since the new_head isn't the apple position, we remove the last element of the body. So body becomes [(2,7)] and then after removing tail, it's just empty? That doesn't make sense because the snake length was 2, so after moving, it should be back to 1 if not growing.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The movement steps are:

After computing new_head:

- Check for collisions.
- If safe:
   a. Insert old head into body (front), making the new body [old_head] + current_body.
   b. If new_head == apple, don't remove tail; else, remove last element.

So initial state: HEAD is (2,7), body [(2,6)].

After moving RIGHT to (3,7):

- Insert old head (2,7) into body → new body becomes [(2,7), (2,6)].
- Since new_head (3,7) != apple (6,6), we remove the last element of the body. So body is now [(2,7)].

So after first move, snake is HEAD (3,7), BODY [(2,7)]. 

Next, I need to plan a path towards (6,6). The Manhattan distance is 4 in x and -1 in y. So overall, I need more rights than lefts (4 right) and one down.

Wait, but the head is at (3,7), which is one step right from (2,7). Now, to reach (6,6), the snake needs to move 3 more steps right and 1 step down.

But I have to be careful about the body. Let's think of a possible path:

Move RIGHT again to (4,7):

- Check collision: new_head is (4,7). The current body is [(2,7)]. Since (4,7) isn't in the body and within grid, it's safe.
- Insert old head (3,7), so body becomes [(3,7), (2,7)].
- Remove last element → body is [(3,7)].

Now, HEAD is at (4,7), BODY [(3,7)].

Next move: RIGHT to (5,7):

- New_head is (5,7). Body is [BODY1 (3,7)].
- No collision. Insert old head (4,7) → body becomes [(4,7), (3,7)].
- Remove last element → body is [(4,7)].

HEAD at (5,7), BODY [(4,7)].

Next move: RIGHT to (6,7):

- New_head is (6,7). Check collision with body [(4,7)]: no conflict.
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,7), (4,7)].
- Remove last → body is [(5,7)].

HEAD at (6,7), BODY [(5,7)]. Now, the apple is at (6,6), which is directly below. So next move should be DOWN to (6,6).

Check collision: new_head is (6,6). The current body is [(5,7)]. No overlap except possibly if any future moves would cause collision.

Wait, but according to the movement rules, when moving to (6,6), we need to check if it's in any BODY cell except the tail. In this case, the body after inserting old head before moving would be [ (5,7) ], and then since new_head is apple, we don't remove the tail.

Wait, let me recheck:

After moving DOWN from (6,7):

- New_head is (6,6), which equals the apple position.
- Insert old head (6,7) into body: current_body is [(5,7)], so new body becomes [(6,7), (5,7)].
- Since it's an apple, don't remove tail → body remains [(6,7), (5,7)].

Wait no—step 3a says insert old head at front of the BODY list. So initial body is [BODY1: (5,7)]. After inserting old_head (6,7) at front, the body becomes [(6,7), (5,7)].

Then step 3b: since new_head == apple position, we do not remove tail. So body remains [(6,7), (5,7)] and then the head is updated to (6,6).

Wait no—after inserting old head, the body becomes [BODY1 (6,7), BODY2 (5,7)]. Then since new_head is apple, we don't remove anything. So the full S after this move would be:

HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [(6,7), (5,7)].

Wait that can't be right because the body segments should be adjacent to each other and to the head. The new head is at (6,6), next segment is (6,7)—so moving from (6,6) to (6,7) would require a move UP, but in this case, it's the body that's behind.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about how the body updates. Let me re-express:

Each movement step:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check collision: if safe,
   a. Insert old head into body (front), so new_body = [old_head] + current_body.
   b. If new_head == apple, do not remove tail; else, remove last element of new_body.

So in this case:

Before moving DOWN:

HEAD is at (6,7)
BODY is [(5,7)]

Move DOWN to (6,6):

- new_head = (6,6), which is the apple.
- Check collision: new_head isn't in current body except possibly if anyBODYi == new_head. But current body is [(5,7)], so no conflict.

Then:

a. Insert old head into front → new_body becomes [ (6,7), (5,7) ].
b. Since new_head is apple, do not remove tail. So the body remains as [ (6,7), (5,7) ].

Wait but that's a problem because the body after inserting would be [(6,7), (5,7)], and the head is at (6,6). The next segment should be adjacent to the head. But (6,6)'s neighbor in direction DOWN is (6,5), but here the next body cell is (6,7), which is two steps up from the new head.

Wait that can't form a continuous snake. So I must have made an error in understanding.

Ah! Wait no—after moving to (6,6), the new_body is [(6,7), (5,7)], but this would make the body not connected. Because the head is at (6,6), and the next body cell is (6,7). That's a Manhattan distance of 1 in y (from 6 to 7). So it's adjacent vertically.

Wait yes: (6,6) is directly below (6,7), so that's a valid connection. So the snake would be:

HEAD (6,6)
BODY [(6,7), (5,7)].

Yes, because each segment is adjacent to the previous one. From HEAD (6,6) to BODY1 (6,7): y increases by 1. Then from (6,7) to (5,7): x decreases by 1.

So that's a valid configuration.

But wait, after eating the apple, the body grows. So in this case, the body length was 2 before moving, and after growing, it becomes 3?

Wait no: let me clarify:

Original state:

HEAD (6,7)
BODY [(5,7)] → total length is 2.

After moving to (6,6):

- Insert old_head (6,7) into front of body → new_body becomes [ (6,7), (5,7) ].
- Since it's an apple, do not remove tail. So the new body remains [ (6,7), (5,7) ].

So the new body length is 2 again? Or does eating an apple increase the length?

Wait no—step 3 says:

If new_head == apple position, don't remove last element; else, do.

In our case, new_head is apple, so we don't remove. So after inserting old head into front (making it [6,7; 5,7]), and not removing any elements, the body becomes [6,7; 5,7]. But wait, that would make the total length 2, same as before.

Wait no—original body was [5,7], after inserting old head at front, it's [6,7; 5,7] → length is 2. Then since we're eating apple, we don't remove anything. So body remains [6,7;5,7].

So the snake is now longer by one segment because we added the old head without removing anything.

Wait no, original body was 1 (just 5,7). After inserting old head, it's 2 segments: 6,7 and 5,7. Then since eating apple, no removal; so total segments are 2+0=2? Or does it add one because we added the old head?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

When you move, you insert the old head into the body (step a), then if not apple, remove last element of current body (which after insertion is step a's new body). So in this case:

Original body: [5,7]

Step a: insert old_head → [6,7; 5,7] (length 2)

Since it's an apple, don't remove anything. So the new body is [6,7;5,7], making the snake length 3? Or no?

Wait wait, perhaps the initial body was size N. After insertion, it's N+1. Then, if not eating apple, you remove last element → back to N.

If eating apple, you don't remove anything → so new body is N+1, meaning the snake grows by one segment.

Yes, that makes sense because eating the apple allows the snake to keep the added segment.

So in this case:

Original body: [5,7] (length 2)

After inserting old_head, length becomes 3.

Since it's an apple, we don't remove any → so new body is [6,7;5,7], but that's only two segments? Wait no, the initial step a is to insert old head into current body. Current body is [5,7].

So after insertion, it's [6,7] + [5,7] = [6,7, 5,7]? No, no—no, inserting at front would just add one segment, making the body list [6,7;5,7], which has two segments.

Wait, perhaps the initial snake length was 2: HEAD and one body. So moving:

After step a: insert old head into body (front), so body becomes [old_head] + current_body → [ (2,7) ] if previous body was [(2,6)], but that's in our first example.

Wait I'm getting confused again. Let me think step by step for this specific move.

Before moving DOWN to (6,6):

- HEAD is at (6,7)
- BODY is [5,7] → meaning one segment behind head: (5,7).

Move DOWN to (6,6). Is that safe? Yes, because new_head isn't in the current body.

Insert old head into front of body:

new_body = [ (6,7) ] + [ (5,7) ] → which is two segments: (6,7), then (5,7).

Since we ate apple, don't remove any segment. So the new body remains as [ (6,7), (5,7) ].

So the snake's length increased by one? Because previously it was 2 (head and one body), now after moving, it's head + two bodies: total of 3 segments?

Wait no—initial body is [5,7] → which counts as one segment behind head. So initial length was 2.

After inserting old_head into front, the new_body has two segments, making the snake length 3? Or does the initial count include the head?

I think the snake's length is always (number of body segments +1). So if initial body is [5,7], that's one segment; adding old_head makes it two segments. Then since we ate apple, no removal: so the new body is two segments, making the total snake length 3.

Thus, after eating, the snake grows by one segment each time.

So in this case, moving to (6,6) would make the body [ (6,7), (5,7) ] and the head at (6,6). The next body segment is (6,7), which is above the head. So the snake is now:

(6,6) → (6,7) → (5,7).

But that seems to form a U-shape.

Now, after this move, I've reached the apple and eaten it. Now, the next moves should continue towards where?

Wait no—I think in this case, the snake would have successfully reached the apple at (6,6), so perhaps the path is done.

But let's check if that's allowed.

So the moves are:

1. RIGHT → (3,7)
2. RIGHT → (4,7)
3. RIGHT → (5,7)
4. RIGHT → (6,7)
5. DOWN → (6,6) [eaten apple]

That would be five moves.

But let's verify each step for safety.

First move: RIGHT to (3,7):

- Safe, no collision with body.
- Body becomes [(2,7)] after insertion and removal.

Second move: RIGHT to (4,7):

- Safe. Body becomes [(3,7)].

Third move: RIGHT to (5,7):

- Safe. Body becomes [(4,7)].

Fourth move: RIGHT to (6,7):

- Safe. Body becomes [(5,7)].

Fifth move: DOWN to (6,6):

- Safe as body is [5,7] which isn't at 6,6.
- After eating, body becomes [6,7;5,7], and since we ate apple, no removal. So total segments are two, making the snake length three.

Thus, this path works.

But wait, in step 5, after moving DOWN to (6,6), do I have any future collision issues? Probably not because the next move would involve moving from there, but since the problem is just about reaching the apple, not continuing further, it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps a shorter path exists.

Another approach: instead of moving all the way right before going down, maybe move down earlier. Let's see.

After initial RIGHT moves:

1. Move RIGHT to (3,7).
2. Then DOWN to (3,6).

Check collision: body is [(2,7)]. new_head is (3,6). No collision.

Insert old head (3,7) into body → [ (3,7), (2,7) ].

Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (3,7) ].

Now HEAD at (3,6), BODY [(3,7)].

But this seems counterproductive because moving down before going all the way right would require more steps to reach the target. Also, after moving down, the body is above the head, which might complicate future moves.

Alternatively, perhaps a diagonal path isn't possible as the snake can only move in four directions each step.

Another idea: Maybe move RIGHT twice and then DOWN multiple times.

But that may lead to longer path.

Alternatively, think about the minimal number of steps:

The Manhattan distance is 4 right (from x=2 to x=6) and y decreases by 1 (from 7 to 6). So total steps needed are 5: 4 rights and 1 down. But considering the way the snake moves, each move can only go one direction.

Thus, any path would require at least five moves.

But in our earlier plan, we took five moves.

Alternatively, is there a way to do it in four? Probably not because you have to cover x by 4 and y by -1, which requires at least 5 steps (since you can't move diagonally).

So the minimal path would be five moves: four rights and one down.

Thus, the sequence:

RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN.

But let's see if this is possible without collision.

Let me outline each step with this approach.

Initial position: HEAD (2,7), BODY [(2,6)].

1. Move RIGHT → (3,7). Check safety: body is [ (2,7) ] after insertion and removal.

   - Insert old head into front of body: [ (2,7) ]
   - No apple eaten yet, so remove last element. Wait no—the initial move after inserting makes the body [(3,7), (2,6)], but then since not eating apple, we remove the last element? Or wait.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the steps again.

After moving RIGHT to (3,7):

- Insert old head (2,7) into front of current body [ (2,6) ] → new_body = [ (2,7), (2,6) ].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element: so final body is [ (2,7) ].

Thus, HEAD at (3,7), BODY [(2,7)].

Next move:

2. Move RIGHT to (4,7).

   - Insert old head (3,7) into front of current body [ (2,7) ] → new_body = [ (3,7), (2,7) ].
   - Remove last element since not apple: body becomes [ (3,7) ].

HEAD at (4,7), BODY [(3,7)].

3. Move RIGHT to (5,7):

   - Insert old head (4,7) into front of current body [ (3,7) ] → new_body = [ (4,7), (3,7) ].
   - Remove last element: body becomes [ (4,7) ].

HEAD at (5,7), BODY [(4,7)].

4. Move RIGHT to (6,7):

   - Insert old head (5,7) into front of current body [ (4,7) ] → new_body = [ (5,7), (4,7) ].
   - Remove last element: body becomes [ (5,7) ].

HEAD at (6,7), BODY [(5,7)].

5. Move DOWN to (6,6):

   - Check safety: body is [ (5,7) ], which isn't at (6,6).
   - Insert old head (6,7) into front of current body → new_body = [ (6,7), (5,7) ].
   - Since eating apple, don't remove anything. So body remains [ (6,7), (5,7) ].

Thus, successfully reached the apple in five moves.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to eat the apple earlier by changing direction earlier, but I think this is the minimal path.

Therefore, the answer would involve moving RIGHT four times and then DOWN once.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple located at a specific coordinate on a grid. The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) one step at a time without crossing its own body.

### Approach
The goal is to find the shortest path for the snake to reach the apple. Given that the snake starts at position (2, 7) and the apple is located at (6, 6), we need to calculate the minimal number of moves required.

1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake can only move one step in any of the four directions each time. To reach from (2, 7) to (6, 6), the snake needs to cover a horizontal distance of 4 units and a vertical distance of -1 unit. This requires at least 5 moves: 4 steps to the right and 1 step down.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - Move Right four times from (2, 7) to (6, 7).
   - Then move Down once from (6, 7) to (6, 6).

3. **Collision Avoidance**: Each move must be checked to ensure the new position does not collide with any part of the snake's body.

### Solution Code
```python
def find_path(start, apple):
    # Initialize the path with the starting position
    path = [start]
    
    current = start
    # Directions: Right, Down
    directions = [(1,0), (0,-1)]
    
    while True:
        # Calculate the direction needed based on the remaining distance
        dx = apple[0] - current[0]
        dy = apple[1] - current[1]
        
        if dx > 0:
            next_pos = (current[0] + 1, current[1])
        elif dx < 0:
            # This case shouldn't occur as we're only moving right
            pass
        else:
            if dy <= 0:
                next_pos = (current[0], current[1] + dy)
        
        # Check all possible moves to find a valid one that doesn't collide with the body
        for move in directions:
            new_x = current[0] + move[0]
            new_y = current[1] + move[1]
            new_pos = (new_x, new_y)
            
            if new_pos == apple:
                path.append(new_pos)
                return path
            
            # Check if this new position is already in the path (body collision)
            if new_pos not in path[:-1]:
                current = new_pos
                path.append(current)
                break
        
        else:
            # No valid move found, which shouldn't happen in a simple grid with space
            return None

start = (2, 7)
apple = (6, 6)

path = find_path(start, apple)
print(path)
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The path starts at the snake's initial position.
2. **Direction Handling**: The snake tries to move towards the apple by checking each possible direction in a predefined order (right and down).
3. **Collision Check**: Each potential move is checked against the current body of the snake to ensure no collision occurs.
4. **Termination**: Once the apple's position is reached, the path is returned.

This approach ensures that the snake reaches the apple in the minimal number of moves while avoiding self-collision.
