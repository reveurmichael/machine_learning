========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to help the snake move from (7,1) to eat the apple at (8,9) without colliding with its body or going out of bounds. 

First, I'll note the current state:

- Head position: (7,1)
- Current direction: DOWN
- Body cells: [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]
- Apple at (8,9)

The snake is moving DOWN currently, but it can't reverse direction immediately. So the first move can't be UP.

Looking at the grid, the apple is at (8,9). The head needs to move right and up significantly. From (7,1) to (8,9), that's +1 in x and +8 in y. So we'll need more UP moves than DOWN ones, and one more RIGHT than LEFT.

The body cells are [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]. The head is at (7,1), so the body extends down from there. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP, but it could be RIGHT or LEFT.

Wait, no—current direction is DOWN, and movement can't reverse, so the first move can't be UP. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN? Wait, the current direction is DOWN, which means the snake's moving in that direction. The next move can't be the opposite, which would be UP. But the direction vectors allow for any of the other directions unless it's NONE.

Wait, the movement rules say: if the direction is "NONE", any move is allowed. Otherwise, you can't reverse. So since current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. It can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN? Or wait, does the snake have a direction vector, so it's moving in that vector until it changes direction.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the direction is DOWN, the head moves by adding (0,-1). So from (7,1), moving DOWN would take it to (7,0), but (7,0) is outside the grid since y can't be 0? Wait no—coordinates are from (0,0) at bottom-left. So (x,y) where y=9 is top-right. So moving DOWN decreases y. From (7,1), moving DOWN would take it to (7,0), which is valid as long as the snake's body doesn't block.

But wait, if the head is currently at (7,1) and direction is DOWN, then the next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP. But we need to make sure that moving in those directions doesn't cause collision with the body or go out of bounds.

Looking at the possible moves from (7,1):

- DOWN: (7,0)
But y=0 is allowed? Wait, the grid is 0 ≤ x <10 and 0 ≤ y <10. So (9,9) is top-right. So moving down from y=1 would take it to y=0, which is valid.

Wait no—wait, movement vectors are defined as:

UP: (0,1), DOWN: (0,-1), etc. But the grid's bottom-left is (0,0). So higher y values mean up. So moving UP increases y by 1, moving DOWN decreases it by 1.

So from (7,1), moving DOWN would take us to (7,0), which is at the very bottom edge of the grid.

But looking at the body cells, the snake's body is [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]. So from (7,1) as head, moving DOWN to (7,0)—would that be safe? Because the next position would have to check if it's in the body. The body cells are at higher y values than 1, so (7,0) is not part of the body.

Wait no—the snake's body includes (7,2), which is one cell above the head. So moving DOWN from (7,1) would take the head to (7,0), but then the new head is at (7,0), and the previous head (7,1) becomes part of the body.

Wait, no—the snake's movement: when you move, the head moves first, then the body follows. So in each step:

- New head = current head + direction
- Then, all body segments follow the next segment.

So if the head is at (7,1), and it moves DOWN to (7,0), the new body would be [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)] but with the head moving. Wait no—the body segments are the list given, which is excluding the head.

Wait, when you make a move, the snake's body shifts: each segment moves into the next one's position. The tail stays unless an apple is eaten.

So in this case, after moving, the new head is (7,0), and the previous head (7,1) becomes part of the body. So the updated body cells would be [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)], but only if the apple isn't eaten.

But in this case, we're not eating an apple yet, so the tail will move. So moving DOWN from (7,1) would take us to (7,0), and then the body becomes [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)] shifting down? Or wait, no—the body follows the movement.

Wait, maybe it's better to think step by step. Let me try to model each possible move from the current state and see if it leads to a safe path.

Current head: (7,1)
Direction: DOWN
Body cells: [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]
Apple at (8,9)

Possible moves:

1. DOWN: new head (7,0). Then, the body would shift, and the tail would move. So body becomes [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)] but with each segment moving down? Or wait, no—each segment moves into the next one's position.

Wait, perhaps when you move DOWN, the head goes to (7,0). Then the body cells become [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)] but each cell shifts down by 1 in y. So (6,5) becomes (6,4), (7,5) becomes (7,4), etc., and the tail at (7,2) moves to (7,1). But then, since we didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed after movement.

Wait no—the body cells are [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]. The head is at (7,1). So when moving DOWN to (7,0), the new body will be [(6,5) moves down to (6,4)], [7,5] to 7,4], but wait no—each segment follows the next one. It's like a linked list.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each step carefully.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN is not the best idea because the apple is at (8,9), which requires moving up and right. Since current direction is DOWN, we need to find a way to change direction towards RIGHT and then UP.

But since current direction is DOWN, the first move can't be UP, but it can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

If we move RIGHT from (7,1) to (8,1), that's a possible step. Let's see if that leads us somewhere safe.

After moving RIGHT:

New head: (8,1)
Direction: RIGHT
Body cells: [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)] shifted—wait no, the body segments move towards the head. So each segment moves into the next one's position.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about possible paths that can reach the apple without colliding with the body.

From (7,1):

We need to get to (8,9). The Manhattan distance is |8-7| + |9-1| = 1+8=9 steps.

But movement must be planned so that each step doesn't collide with the body or go out of bounds.

Current direction is DOWN, which means the next move can't be UP. So first moves could be RIGHT, LEFT, or DOWN.

Option 1: Move RIGHT to (8,1). Now, check if this position is safe.

The new head is at (8,1). The body cells are [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]. So the body is above y=2. (8,1) is not in the body, so it's safe.

After moving RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT. Now, next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction. So from here, possible moves are DOWN or RIGHT.

But we need to go up a lot—so perhaps after moving right, start moving up.

Wait, but from (8,1), moving UP is allowed as it's not the opposite of current direction (RIGHT). Let me see:

Move 2: UP to (8,2).

Now head is at (8,2), body cells would have shifted. The previous body was [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)], but after moving right and up, the new body would be:

Wait, when you move from (7,1) to (8,1), the body cells are updated as follows: each segment moves into the next one. So the first body cell (6,5) becomes (6,4)? No—wait, no—the movement is that all body segments follow the head's movement.

Actually, when you move, the head moves, then each body segment moves to where the previous segment was.

So from (7,1), moving RIGHT:

- New head: (8,1)
- The first body cell (6,5) becomes (7,5)'s position? Or perhaps it's better to model that the entire snake's body follows, but it's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on ensuring that each new head position doesn't collide with any part of the current body.

So after moving RIGHT to (8,1), check if this is in the body cells: no. Then move UP to (8,2): same check—no collision.

Then, continue moving UP as much as possible.

But wait, from (8,2), next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction from RIGHT to LEFT, which isn't allowed unless the current direction is NONE.

Wait, current direction after first move was RIGHT. So next moves can't be LEFT.

So from (8,1) with direction RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT. So possible moves are UP or RIGHT.

But moving right further might not help because we need to go up a lot.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN is necessary at some point to avoid the body.

Wait, but the apple is at (8,9), which requires going up 8 steps in y.

Let me try another approach. Since the snake's body is currently down from (7,2) to (7,5). So if we move right and then up, we can avoid the body.

But wait, moving right would take us out of the column where the body is, so that might be safe.

So possible path:

1. Move RIGHT to (8,1)
2. Then move UP repeatedly until reaching y=9.

But each time after moving UP, direction remains UP unless changed.

Wait, but from (8,1), moving UP once is allowed. Let's see the steps:

Move 1: RIGHT to (8,1). Safe.
Move 2: UP to (8,2). Safe.
Move 3: UP to (8,3). Safe.
...
But each move after that needs to check if the new position is safe.

Wait, but the body is moving as well. Each time we move, the body shifts, so after each step, the body cells change.

This makes it complex because the body's configuration changes with each move, which affects whether future moves are safe.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to plan a path that goes right, then up all the way to (8,9), ensuring that each step doesn't hit any part of the body and doesn't go out of bounds.

But given the initial direction is DOWN, we have to make sure the first move isn't UP.

So let's outline a possible sequence:

1. Move RIGHT: (7,1) → (8,1)
2. Move UP 8 times: from (8,1) to (8,9)

Total moves: 1 + 8 = 9 steps.

But we have to check if this path is safe at each step.

After moving right:

- Head at (8,1), body cells are [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)], and the head was added as (7,1) becomes part of the body? No—wait, when you move, the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten. Since we're not eating an apple yet, the tail is at (6,5)? Wait no—the body cells are given as [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)], so after moving right to (8,1), the new body would be [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)] because each segment follows.

Wait no—the body cells are in order from tail to head? Or head to tail?

Actually, when you move, the head moves first, then each body segment moves into the position of the previous one. So if the body is [A, B, C, D, E], and you move, then the new body is [B, C, D, E, F] where F is the old head's position.

But in our case, the body cells are given as [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)], which probably represents the segments from tail to head. So after moving right:

- Head moves to (8,1)
- The new body would be [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)]

So in this case, after move 1: RIGHT, the body cells are [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)]. So when we check for collision in move 2, we have to ensure that new head isn't in any of these positions.

Move 2: UP from (8,1) to (8,2). Is (8,2) in the body? The body after first move is [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)]. So no collision. Safe.

Now, direction is UP because we moved from RIGHT to UP—wait no: if you move RIGHT, then UP, that's a change in direction.

Wait, when you make a move that isn't straight, does the direction change? Yes, it does.

So after moving RIGHT (direction becomes RIGHT), next move can be UP, which changes direction to UP.

Now, for each subsequent move, we have to ensure that we don't reverse direction. So from UP, next moves can't be DOWN unless current direction is NONE.

But in this case, since the direction is UP, next moves can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP—wait no: reversing direction would mean moving opposite. Wait, actually, when you move, the direction changes to the new movement's direction. So after moving UP from RIGHT, direction becomes UP, and next moves can't be DOWN (since that would reverse direction).

But wait, I'm getting confused about how direction works.

Let me clarify: each time you make a move, your direction changes to that movement. So if you're currently facing RIGHT, and you move UP, your new direction is UP. From there, you can't move LEFT because it's the opposite of UP. Wait no—if you're moving UP, then LEFT would be a 90-degree turn, not reversing direction.

Wait, actually, in this problem, reversing direction only happens when moving directly opposite to current direction. So if you're facing RIGHT and move LEFT, that's reversing direction. Similarly, facing DOWN and moving UP reverses direction. Other movements (like turning left or right) don't reverse direction but change it.

So in the context of this problem, when you make a move that is not directly opposite to your current direction, it's allowed, and your direction changes accordingly.

Therefore, after moving RIGHT, if I then move UP, that's allowed because it's not directly opposite. Then from UP, I can continue moving UP or turn right (which would be LEFT in this context) or left (RIGHT).

But wait, no—if you're facing UP, turning right would be to face RIGHT, and turning left would be to face LEFT.

So movement options are always available except for reversing direction.

Therefore, after move 1: RIGHT (direction is RIGHT)
Move 2: UP (allowed, not opposite) → direction becomes UP
Move 3: UP (continue moving in same direction)
...
Up until y=9.

But we need to make sure that each step doesn't cause collision with the body.

After move 1: body cells are [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)]

Move 2: UP to (8,2). Body becomes [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1)]

So new body is [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1)]

Move 3: UP to (8,3). Body becomes [(7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)]

And so on.

Each time we move up, the body shifts accordingly. As long as our new head position isn't in the current body cells, it's safe.

So let's outline the moves step by step:

Move 0: Head at (7,1), Direction: DOWN, Body: [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,1). Direction: RIGHT. Body becomes [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)]. Check: (8,1) not in body. Safe.

Move 2: UP → (8,2). Direction: UP. Body becomes [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1)]. Check: (8,2) not in body. Safe.

Move 3: UP → (8,3). Direction: UP. Body becomes [(7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)]. Check: safe.

Move 4: UP → (8,4). Body shifts again; check safety.

Continue this until:

Move 9: (8,9). After each move up, the body cells are moving towards (8,1) and beyond. Wait, but as we keep moving UP, the body cells from previous moves will be below us, so they won't interfere.

Wait, actually, when moving up from (8,2), the body is [(7,4), ...], which is at y=4, but our head is now at y=3. So in the next move to y=4, we're still not colliding because the body cell at (7,4) is at x=7, and our head is at x=8.

Therefore, as long as we keep moving UP along x=8, we won't collide with any body cells which are either at x=7 or lower.

So this path seems safe: move RIGHT once, then UP 8 times.

But wait, after the first move, the direction is RIGHT. Then when you move UP, direction changes to UP, and from there, moving UP again doesn't reverse direction.

Yes, that should be fine.

Now, let's check if the number of moves matches what we need.

We have:

1. Move RIGHT: 1 step
2. Move UP 8 times: 8 steps
Total: 9 steps.

But Manhattan distance is 9, which makes sense because it's the minimum number of steps required.

Additionally, after reaching (8,9), we would be at the apple's position and can eat it, but in this problem, I think we just need to reach the apple without dying, so the path above should suffice.

But wait, let me double-check each step for collision:

Move 1: (8,1) – body cells after move are [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)]. So (8,1) is safe.

Move 2: (8,2) – body cells after move are [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1)]. (8,2) not in body. Safe.

Similarly, each subsequent UP move leads to a position that's at x=8 and y increasing, while the body cells either stay at x=7 or are behind us.

Therefore, this path is safe.

So the moves would be:

1. RIGHT
2. UP (x8)

But wait, when you eat the apple, do you add it to the body? In this case, we don't need to worry about that because once we reach (8,9), the movement stops.

Therefore, the sequence is valid.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to the position of an apple while avoiding collisions with its own body. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move changes the direction of the snake unless it would reverse its current direction.

### Approach
1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at position (7, 1) facing downward.
2. **Objective**: Reach the apple located at (8, 9).
3. **Constraints**: 
   - The snake cannot move directly opposite to its current direction.
   - Each move must avoid colliding with any part of the snake's body.

The strategy involves:
1. Moving right from (7, 1) to (8, 1). This is allowed since it does not reverse the initial downward direction and avoids collision with the body.
2. Subsequently moving up repeatedly until reaching (8, 9). Each upward move shifts the snake's body positions but keeps them away from the head's new position.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    
    # Initial state
    head = (7, 1)
    direction = 'down'
    body = [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]
    apple = (8,9)
    
    path = []
    
    # Move right once
    move = 'right'
    new_head = (head[0] + 1 if move == 'right' else head[0] - 1 if move == 'left' else head[0], 
                head[1] + 1 if move in ['up', 'right'] else head[1] - 1 if move in ['down', 'left'] else head[1])
    path.append(move)
    
    # Update direction and body
    direction = move
    new_body = [(head[0], head[1])] + [ (b[0], b[1]) for b in body[:-1] ]  # Assuming the tail moves forward
    body = new_body
    
    # Now, move up 8 times
    for _ in range(8):
        move = 'up'
        new_head = (new_head[0], new_head[1] + 1)
        path.append(move)
        
        # Update direction and body
        direction = move
        new_body = [(new_head[0], new_head[1])] + [ (b[0], b[1]) for b in body[:-1] ]
        body = new_body
        
    print(' '.join(path))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (7, 1) facing down. Its body segments are positioned from (6,5) to (7,2).
- **First Move**: Moving right takes the head to (8, 1), changing direction to right and updating the body positions.
- **Subsequent Moves**: After moving right, each subsequent move is upward. This path avoids collisions as each new position does not intersect with any part of the snake's body.

This approach ensures that the snake reaches the apple efficiently without colliding with its own body by strategically changing directions to avoid reversing and causing a collision.
