  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move horizontally to the right to align with the apple's x-coordinate (9) and then move up to match the apple's y-coordinate (3). However, since the apple is already at the same y-coordinate as the snake's head, only horizontal movement is required. The sequence ensures the snake moves right three times to reach x=9, avoiding collisions with its body and the wall."
