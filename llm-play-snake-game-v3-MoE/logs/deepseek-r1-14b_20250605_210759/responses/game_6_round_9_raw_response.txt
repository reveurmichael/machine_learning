========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to these kinds of game AI problems, but I'll try my best.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake and where the apple is located. The snake's head is at (6,4), which is in the middle-left area of the grid. The body cells are given as [(7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3)], so the body extends from (7,4) all the way to (6,3). That means the tail is at (6,3). The apple is at (7,2).

The direction of movement currently is "LEFT". Since the head is at (6,4), moving left would take it to (5,4). But I need to consider where the body is and make sure that the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail if it's about to move.

Wait, no—looking back at the problem statement: When checking for collisions, the new_head cannot coincide with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So if I'm moving in a direction where the new head is going into a body part, unless it's the tail and the tail is about to move (which only happens when not eating an apple), it's a collision.

So first, let me visualize the grid:

The snake starts at (6,4). The body behind it goes right to (7,4), then to (8,4), (9,4), down to (9,3), left to (8,3), (7,3), and finally (6,3) as the tail.

So from head (6,4), moving left would take it to (5,4). Now, I need to check if this new head is safe. The body cells are all behind except for the tail. Since the current direction is LEFT, moving in that direction again is allowed unless it causes a collision.

But wait—the current direction is LEFT, and the next move can't be opposite. So, according to rule 2: "Cannot reverse". If current direction is LEFT, I can't choose RIGHT next. But from LEFT, valid moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT? Or does it mean that you can't reverse the previous direction? Let me check.

The movement rules say: Cannot reverse: if current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for LEFT↔RIGHT. If current direction is NONE (i.e., first move), any is allowed. So, from LEFT, I cannot go RIGHT, but can go UP or DOWN, or continue moving LEFT.

Wait, no—if the current direction is LEFT, then on the next move, you can't choose RIGHT as a new direction because that's reversing. But in this case, since the snake was moving LEFT before, and the new direction could be something else except RIGHT.

So for the first move, from (6,4) with current direction LEFT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again? Or can't go LEFT again? Hmm, no—reversing is not allowed. So if I was moving LEFT, I cannot choose RIGHT next. But moving in the same direction (LEFT) again is fine because it's not reversing.

Wait, let me think: Reversing would mean going back the opposite way. So from LEFT, you can't go RIGHT, but you can continue moving LEFT as long as possible.

So, for the first move, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.

Now, considering that, let's see where the apple is. The apple is at (7,2), which is to the right and down from the head's current position.

The head is at (6,4). To reach (7,2), it needs to move right once and then down twice. But since movement can't be reversed immediately, I need to plan a path that avoids collisions with the body.

Let me try to find a safe path step by step.

First, the current state:

- Head: (6,4)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body: [(7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3)]
- Apple: (7,2)

So, from (6,4), moving LEFT is possible but let's see where that would lead. Moving left to (5,4). Then, in the next step, can we move down? Or perhaps another direction.

But I'm not sure if moving left initially is safe because after moving, the body will shift. Let me think about the movement rules again.

When you move, the body shifts by adding the old head as the new first body segment and removing the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So, in this case, the current body is [(7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3)]. The head is at (6,4).

If I move LEFT to (5,4):

- New_head = (5,4)
- Check collisions: Is (5,4) in the body? Let's see—body cells are (7,4), etc., so no. So no collision.
- Then, insert old head (6,4) into body list. Now the body becomes [(6,4)] + current body list.

Wait, no—the current body is from BODY1 to BODYN. So when we move, the new body after inserting the old head would be [old_head] + body_list. So if the old body was [7,4; 8,4; ...], then new body becomes [6,4; 7,4; 8,4; ...].

But wait, according to step 3a: Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1). So after moving left, the body will have the old head (6,4) added as the first element. Then, since we didn't eat an apple (since new_head is not apple's position), we remove the tail.

Wait, the apple is at (7,2), which is different from (5,4). So no growth—body remains same length.

So after moving left:

- Head becomes (5,4)
- Body becomes [(6,4)] + [7,4; 8,4; ... up to (6,3)], but since we didn't eat apple, the tail is removed. So the new body list would be [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3]. The length remains 7.

Wait, original body has 7 cells (from 7,4 to 6,3). After adding old head and removing tail, it's still 7? Because we add one at front and remove one from end. So the new body is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3].

So now, the snake is at (5,4) with this updated body.

Is there any collision in this new state? The head is at (5,4), which isn't in the body except possibly when checking if it's moving into a body cell. Since we've checked before moving that (5,4) isn't in the body except for the tail case, and since the apple was not eaten, the tail was removed, so no collision.

But I'm more concerned about future steps—can I plan a path from here towards the apple at (7,2).

Alternatively, maybe moving left is not the best initial step. Let me consider other possible first moves.

From (6,4), current direction is LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.

Option 1: Move LEFT to (5,4) as above.

Option 2: Move DOWN to (6,3). Wait, but the tail is at (6,3). If I move down, new_head would be (6,3), which is the current position of the tail. But according to collision rules, this is allowed only if the tail will move in this turn.

Wait, after moving, the body will shift—so in this case, since we're not eating an apple, the tail will be removed. So when we move down, new_head would be at (6,3), which was the old tail position. But since the tail is about to move (get removed), it's allowed.

Wait, no—the collision check is whether new_head coincides with any BODYi except for the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

So in this case, moving down would take head to (6,3). Let's see if (6,3) is a body cell. The current body list includes (6,3) as the last element. So new_head = (6,3), which coincides with the tail's position. Since the tail will be removed in this move, it's allowed.

So moving down to (6,3) is safe because the collision rule allows this only when the tail is about to move.

But wait, after moving down, what happens? The new head is at (6,3), which was the tail. So in this case, we've eaten the apple or not?

No, the apple is at (7,2). So if I move down to (6,3), since it's the current position of the tail, but after moving, the body shifts.

Wait, let me re-examine step 3: After inserting old head into the front, and then removing the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So in this case:

- Moving DOWN from (6,4) to (6,3).
- Check collision: new_head is (6,3). Is this in body? Yes, it's the last element.
- Since we're not eating the apple, we remove the tail. So collision is allowed because the tail is about to move.

So moving down is possible and safe.

After moving down:

- Head becomes (6,3)
- Body becomes [old_head (6,4)] + current body except the last element.
Wait no—current body is [(7,4), (8,4), ..., (6,3)]. So after inserting old head (6,4) at front, body becomes [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3]. Then since we didn't eat the apple, we remove the last element, which is (6,3). So new body is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3].

So now, head is at (6,3), and body is from 6,4 to 8,3.

Wait, but the apple is at (7,2). So from here, perhaps we can plan a path down and right.

But moving down again would take us to (6,2), which may not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe move left or right next.

But let's think about another initial move: UP.

From (6,4) moving UP would take it to (6,5). Is that position safe?

The current body is behind from (7,4) onwards, so (6,5) is not part of the body. So moving up is possible.

After moving UP:

- Head at (6,5)
- Body becomes [old_head (6,4)] + original body, then remove tail since no apple eaten.
So new body: [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3].

Wait, the length remains 7? Because adding one at front and removing one from end.

But (6,5) is not part of the original body, so no collision. So moving up is safe.

Then, perhaps from there, we can move right towards the apple.

So let's plan a possible path:

1. Move UP to (6,5)
2. Then RIGHT to (7,5)
3. Then RIGHT again to (8,5), but wait, the body after first step would be [6,4;7,4;...], so moving right might lead into a collision.

Alternatively, from (6,5), maybe move down towards the apple.

But perhaps this path is more complicated. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the apple is at (7,2). So to reach there, we need to move two steps down and one step right from the current head position.

So from (6,4) -> (6,3) -> (6,2), but that's moving down twice, but the body might block the way.

Alternatively, maybe first move left, then down, etc. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think of each possible initial move and see where it leads.

Option 1: Move LEFT to (5,4)

Then, in next step, can we move DOWN?

After moving left, head is at (5,4), body is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3].

So from (5,4), possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.

If I move down to (5,3), check collision: is (5,3) in body? The current body has no (5,3). So safe.

But then, the path would be moving further away from the apple. Maybe not optimal.

Alternatively, after moving left, perhaps move right again towards the apple.

Wait, but from (5,4), moving RIGHT to (6,4)—but that's where the old head was inserted as body[0]. So new_head = (6,4), which is in the body as first element. But since we are not eating an apple, and tail is being removed, this would be allowed only if the collision is at the tail.

Wait, no—since moving right from (5,4) to (6,4), which was the previous head position, but now it's part of the body. So that would cause a collision unless it's the tail.

But in this case, after inserting old head (6,4), the new body is [6,4;7,4;...]. So moving back to (6,4) would collide with body[0], which isn't the tail since the tail was at (6,3). Wait no—the new body after moving left and then right would have a different structure.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to consider another initial move.

Option 2: Move DOWN to (6,3)

After moving down:

- Head is at (6,3)
- Body becomes [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3]

So now, the apple is at (7,2). From here, can we move right and then down?

But let's see:

From (6,3), possible directions are UP, LEFT, or DOWN? Wait, current direction after moving down was not specified—since initial direction was LEFT, but you moved DOWN as the first step. So movement rules: from previous direction LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT.

Wait no—the "cannot reverse" rule applies to the new direction based on the previous one. So if I moved DOWN as the first step, which was possible because current direction was LEFT and DOWN is allowed (since it's not reversing), then for the next move, what directions are allowed?

The new direction is now DOWN. So from here, the next move can't be UP.

So from (6,3), moving RIGHT is allowed as long as it doesn't reverse.

Wait, no: current direction after first move was DOWN. So from there, you can't choose UP next; but can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But if I'm at (6,3), and the apple is at (7,2), maybe moving right to (7,3) would be better.

So let's try:

1. Move DOWN to (6,3)
2. Then move RIGHT to (7,3)

Check collision after step 2: new_head = (7,3). Is this in the body? The current body is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3]. So (7,3) is part of the body. Wait, that's problematic.

Because moving to (7,3), which is in the body—specifically, it's the last element except for (6,3). Wait no—the current body after step 1 is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3]. So (7,3) isn't part of that. Or wait, is (7,3) in the body? No—it's [6,4], [7,4], etc., up to (8,3). So (7,3) is not in the body.

Wait, no—the body after step 1 is:

After moving down from (6,4) to (6,3):

Body becomes [old_head (6,4)] + current body without tail. The original body was [(7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3)]. So after adding old head, it's [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3], then we remove the tail (6,3). So new body is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3].

So (7,3) is not in this body. Therefore, moving to (7,3) would be safe.

After step 2:

- Head at (7,3)
- Body becomes [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3], and then inserting old head (6,3) if we move again. Wait no—step 3a says insert the old head into the body list when moving.

Wait, let me clarify:

After each move, regardless of whether an apple is eaten, you first insert the old head into the front of the body, then remove the tail unless an apple was eaten.

So after step 1: moved to (6,3), so old_head is (6,4). So new body becomes [6,4] + original_body[:-1]. Original body was [7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3;6,3]. So after inserting, it's [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3], then remove the tail (since no apple eaten), so new body is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3].

Then step 2: moving from (6,3) to (7,3):

- old_head becomes (6,3)
- insert into front: [6,3] + current body ([6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3])
So new body is [6,3;6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3]
Then remove tail since no apple eaten: new body becomes [6,3;6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3]

So head is now at (7,3), and body starts with (6,3).

Now, from here, can we move down to (7,2) which is the apple?

After step 3: moving from (7,3) to (7,2):

- old_head is (7,3)
- insert into front: [7,3] + current body ([6,3;6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3])
So new body is [7,3;6,3;6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3]
Then remove tail (no apple eaten), so new body is [7,3;6,3;6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4]

Thus, we have reached the apple at (7,2).

So this path works:

1. Move DOWN from (6,4) to (6,3)
2. Move RIGHT to (7,3)
3. Move DOWN to (7,2)

But wait—after step 3, the head is at (7,2), which is the apple's position.

Therefore, this path successfully reaches the apple in three moves.

Now, let me check if there are any collisions along the way.

After step 1: moving down to (6,3)—safe as discussed.

After step 2: moving right to (7,3)—safe because (7,3) wasn't in the body after step 1.

Wait, no—after inserting old head in step 2, let me recheck:

In step 2, before moving, body was [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3].

Moving right to (7,3): new_head is (7,3), which wasn't part of the body before inserting old head.

Wait, no—the process is:

1. After step 1: body is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3]

2. Step 2: move to (7,3):

   a. Insert old_head (6,3) into front of body.

      New body becomes [6,3] + [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3]

   b. Then remove tail since no apple eaten: new body is [6,3;6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3]

So (7,3) is the head, and the body doesn't include (7,3) until after the move.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The head's new position isn't part of the body until the next moves.

Actually, the snake's body segments follow the path the head has taken, excluding the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So when you move, the head moves, then each segment follows the previous one, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten.

Therefore, in step 2: moving from (6,3) to (7,3), the body after inserting old head would include (6,3), but not (7,3) yet because that's where the head is moving to.

Thus, no collision occurs because the new position isn't part of the current body.

So this path works without collisions.

Alternatively, another approach could be:

1. Move RIGHT from (6,4) to (7,4)
2. Then DOWN twice to reach (7,2)

But let's check if that would work.

After step 1: moving right to (7,4):

- old_head is (6,4), inserted into front of body [7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3;7,3;6,3], then remove tail since no apple eaten. So new body is [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3].

Then step 2: moving down to (7,3):

- old_head is (7,4), inserted into front of current body [6,4;7,4;... no, wait:

After inserting, the body becomes [7,4] + previous body [6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3;8,3], then remove tail. So new body is [7,4;6,4;7,4;8,4;9,4;9,3].

But now, when moving to (7,3), which isn't part of the current body.

Wait, perhaps this is more complicated, but it might also work.

However, regardless of the path, the key point is that after three moves, we can reach the apple without colliding.

So the minimal number of steps required would be 3.

But wait—each move brings the head one step closer. Since the apple is two steps down and one to the right from the initial position, it's a Manhattan distance of 3. Therefore, at least three moves are needed.

Thus, the answer is that it takes three moves for the snake to reach the apple.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple in exactly three moves by strategically moving downward twice and then moving right once, or any combination of moves that cover the necessary steps without causing self-collision. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Move Down**: From (6,4) to (6,3). This positions the head closer to the apple.
2. **Move Right**: From (6,3) to (7,3). Now, aligned horizontally with the apple.
3. **Move Down Again**: From (7,3) to (7,2), where the apple is located.

By following these three moves, the snake successfully navigates to the apple without colliding with its own body.

$\boxed{3}$
