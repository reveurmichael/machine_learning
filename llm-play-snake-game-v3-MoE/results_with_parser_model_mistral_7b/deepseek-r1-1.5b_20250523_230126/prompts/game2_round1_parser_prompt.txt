<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out a path for my snake to move from (5,5) to (4,5) on a 10x10 grid. The snake is currently at [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] with a tail at (3,3). 

First, let's understand the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction on the first move, which means if it moves in one direction, the next move must be different. Also, after eating the apple, the tail doesn't move immediately, so I have to plan carefully.

The current position of the head is (5,5), and the apple is at (4,5). So the snake needs to move left towards the apple. But I should check for collisions first. 

Looking at the body segments, after moving left, the new head will be at (4,5). Now, I need to see if any of the body parts are blocked. The old tail was at (3,3), and since we're eating the apple, it stays put. So the next positions in the body are all around (3,3).

Wait, no. After moving left, the new head is at (4,5). Then, I need to remove the tail if it's not eating the apple. Since it is, the snake grows by one. But wait, the initial move is before that?

Hmm, no, let me check again.

1. Compute new_head: from (5,5), moving left would be (4,5). That's where the apple is.
2. Check for collisions. If new_head coincides with any body part except possibly the tail when it will move. But since we are eating the apple, does that affect the collision check? The collision check only considers the current state before body shifts. So if the new_head is (4,5), which is the apple's position.

Wait, no: in step 2, after moving, I need to see if new_head is inside bounds and not already part of the body (except for the tail when it moves). But since we are eating the apple, does that mean the snake isn't about to move its tail? Hmm, maybe the collision check should ignore any previous positions except for the current state. 

Wait, perhaps I should remove the old tail only after checking. Because if I eat the apple, the new_head is added to the front, and then the old head moves out of the body, but the old tail (now at new_head) stays.

So in this case, moving left from (5,5) would take me to (4,5), which is where the apple is. Since we are eating it, I need to grow the snake by one segment and not remove the tail because we're eating. 

Wait, no: after moving, if new_head equals apple position, then the snake grows by one, meaning adding a body1, but since we just ate the apple, does that mean we don't move the tail? Or do we remove it?

I think when you eat the apple, the snake doesn't grow; instead, it's considered to have consumed the apple. So in this case, after moving left, if new_head is (4,5), which is the apple position, then we check collisions: since it's not part of the body except possibly the tail, but the tail would be at (3,3) and doesn't move because we ate the apple. So (4,5) isn't in the current body positions except if our new_head coincides with a previous segment.

Wait, no. The old body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)], and the tail was at (3,3). So if new_head is (4,5) and it's not any of these points except maybe the old head. Wait, no, the old body doesn't have a segment at (4,5); it has segments at (4,4), (4,3), etc.

So when I move to (4,5), it's not in the current body positions except if I've shifted, but since we are eating, maybe that collision isn't an issue. Wait, no: after moving left, new_head is (4,5). The old body has a segment at (3,3), and after movement, the snake's head moves out of the body. Since we ate the apple, perhaps the tail doesn't move.

Wait, I think the collision check happens before any movements except when eating the apple. So if new_head is (4,5), which is not in the current body segments, so no collision. Thus, I can safely move to (4,5).

So the path would be just moving left once. But wait, let me double-check: after moving left from (5,5) to (4,5), do I need to consider any future moves? The snake's next direction is important.

Wait, no. Since the snake can only move in one step at a time, and we're trying to reach (4,5) directly, perhaps just moving once is sufficient. But let me think about whether there are obstacles or if it's possible to make another move after that.

But wait, if I move left to (4,5), the snake grows by one, so now the body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,5)]. But does this affect the movement? No, because we are moving left and eating the apple.

Wait, but in the example given earlier, when the snake moves right from (4,4) to (5,4), it grows by one. So perhaps in this case, after moving to (4,5), since the apple is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the next body is just [(4,5)]. But that might not be a problem.

Wait, but let me think about whether there's any other constraints. After eating the apple, you must have at least one legal move next turn. So if I move left once, and then try to move in another direction, I need to make sure that from (4,5), there is still a path.

But perhaps moving directly left once is enough because the snake can't reverse direction on the first move. Wait, but moving left would be allowed as it's the same direction.

Wait, no: the first move must not reverse if it's the first step. So in this case, the first move is to the right? Or wait, the initial direction was "NONE", so the snake can choose any direction except reversed.

But since we are moving left from (5,5) to (4,5), that's allowed because it's not a reversal if the previous direction wasn't there. Wait, but I'm considering this as the first move after starting at (5,5). So in this case, the snake starts at (5,5), with head pointing left.

Wait, maybe I got confused. Let me clarify: when we start, the snake is facing "NONE", meaning it can choose any direction except reversing. But initially, the snake's position is (4,4) with a body of [(4,3), (4,2), ...]. Hmm, but in this case, maybe I'm starting at the head being at (5,5).

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine my initial state.

The problem states: "You are given the following inputs: • Head position: `(5,5)` — (x,y) of the snake's head. So the snake is positioned with its body cells from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. 

So if the head is at (5,5), and the snake is pointing in some direction. But since it's "NONE", perhaps the first move can be any direction except reversing, but wait, it's the initial state before any moves.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the initial setup. Let me think again.

The snake S is `[HEAD, BODY1, ..., BODYN]`. So in this case, the head is at (5,5), and the body cells are [(4,4), (4,3), ...]. Wait, but if the head is at (5,5), that means it's behind a segment which is two cells back. Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The snake starts with its head at (4,4). So from the problem statement: "You are given the following inputs:" including the body segments, ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if S has N+1 elements, the first element is the segment immediately behind the head.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the snake is composed of multiple cells, and each segment after the head is behind the previous one. But perhaps for this problem, I can model the snake's movement based on its current body segments.

But since we are planning a path from (5,5) to (4,5), maybe it's easier to move left once because that's the direct path.

Wait, but let me think about possible collisions. If moving left from (5,5) is allowed without collision because the next cell is empty? Or perhaps the body segments are arranged in such a way that they don't interfere.

Alternatively, after eating the apple, maybe I need to move right again on the next turn, but I can only do one step at a time. So moving left once is sufficient.

But wait, let's consider that after moving left from (5,5) to (4,5), which is where the apple is, and since we're eating it, the snake doesn't grow and the tail doesn't move. So from there, I can try to move right again in the next turn.

So the path would be: first move left once, then perhaps move right once if needed, but given that we already ate the apple, moving further might not be necessary.

Wait, no: after eating the apple, do we have any other constraints? For example, does the snake need to stay on a particular direction or cannot reverse direction again?

But since it's allowed to choose any direction except reversing if it was the previous move. But since I'm starting from "NONE", perhaps the first step can be in any direction.

Wait, but moving left is probably the correct path because that's the direct route towards (4,5).

So, putting it all together: the snake should move left once to reach (4,5) where the apple is. Since we are eating it, no further growth or movement is needed until we decide on another direction.

Wait, but in this case, moving left from (5,5) would place me at (4,5), which is the apple's position. So I can just move there and stop. But let me check for any possible collisions.

The current body segments are [(4,3), (4,2), ..., (3,3)], so (4,5) isn't in any of those positions. Therefore, no collision occurs. Thus, moving left is safe.

So the plan is: move left once to reach (4,5).

But wait, let me think about whether that's allowed according to the problem statement. The problem states that you can only move in certain directions, but since I'm starting from a position where all adjacent cells are empty except for possibly some behind, which we don't have.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the snake's body is arranged such that moving left isn't possible because the next cell after (5,5) is empty? Or maybe in this specific setup, it is allowed.

Alternatively, maybe I should move right first if that leads to a better path.

But since we are at (5,5), moving left would be directly towards the apple. So yes, that's the optimal path.

So my plan is: move left once.

Let me write that down as the solution.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple by moving its head left once from position (5,5) to (4,5). After eating the apple, it doesn't need to make any further moves. So, the path is simply:

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The snake's current position with the head at (5,5).
2. Move left from (5,5) to (4,5), which is where the apple is located.
3. Since we eat the apple, the next body segment remains unchanged.

Final answer: The path is just one move to the left.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (4, 5).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
