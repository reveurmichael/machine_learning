========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (0,3) to the apple at (9,3). The snake is currently facing LEFT, and its body is [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. So, the head is at (0,3), which is on the bottom-left edge. The apple is all the way to the right at (9,3). 

First, I need to understand the current state. The snake's body is behind the head, so moving left from (0,3) isn't possible because x can't be negative. That means the first move can't be LEFT again because that would take it out of bounds. Wait, actually, the current direction is LEFT, but according to the rules, we can't reverse direction immediately. So the next move can't be RIGHT since the current direction is LEFT.

Wait, no—the rule says you can't reverse. Since current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT? Or wait, does reversing mean going back in the opposite direction of where you came from? Hmm, I think it means that if you're moving LEFT, your next move can't be RIGHT, which would cause the snake to reverse and potentially collide with its body.

Wait no, according to rule 2: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN. Similarly for LEFT ↔ RIGHT. So in this case, current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT. Because LEFT and RIGHT are each other's reverses? Wait, that doesn't make sense because moving left and right are opposite directions along the x-axis.

Wait no, perhaps it's that you can't change to the exact opposite direction of your current movement. So if you're moving UP, you can't move DOWN next, because that would reverse the direction. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT—since they are opposites on the same axis. So in this case, since current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, but wait: the current direction is LEFT, which means the snake's head is moving to the left from (1,3) to (0,3). The body behind is at (1,3), so if we try to move LEFT again, that would take the head to (-1,3), which is out of bounds. So actually, moving LEFT again isn't allowed because it's a wall collision.

So first, I need to figure out possible initial moves. Since current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT (because that's reversing). Wait no—the rule says you can't reverse. If current is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT as the next move because they're opposites? Or maybe the rule means that if you are moving in a certain direction, you cannot switch to its opposite.

Wait, according to the rules: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT as the next move. So in this case, current direction is LEFT, so next move can be UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT.

Wait no—current direction is LEFT, so the forbidden next directions are RIGHT? Because they're each other's reverses. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recheck the rule: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT next because it's the opposite direction.

Wait no—that would make sense only if the movement was along the same axis. For example, moving LEFT and then RIGHT would cause the snake to reverse direction, which could lead to collision with its body.

But in our case, since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT because it's the opposite. So from LEFT, we can choose UP or DOWN as possible directions.

So starting at (0,3), facing LEFT, but moving LEFT would take us out of bounds, so that's invalid. Therefore, the only possible initial moves are UP and DOWN.

Let me check: current head is at (0,3). If I move UP, new_head becomes (0,4). That's within bounds because y can go up to 9. Then, I need to check for collisions. The body is [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. So the new head at (0,4) would be safe because none of the body segments are at (0,4).

If I move DOWN, new_head becomes (0,2). That's also within bounds. Checking for collisions: is any body segment at (0,2)? The body list includes (1,3), etc., so no. So both UP and DOWN seem possible as initial moves.

But let's think about the apple position—(9,3). Since we're starting at x=0, y=3, the apple is to the right along the same row. To reach it, ideally, we'd want to move rightwards, but our current direction is LEFT, and next move can't be RIGHT. So perhaps after moving UP or DOWN initially, we can later change direction.

Wait, no—after the first move, if I choose UP, then my new direction would be UP, so the next move can't be DOWN. Or wait, each move's direction must not reverse the previous one. Let me clarify: according to rule 2, you cannot reverse your current direction on the next move. So for example, if I'm moving UP now, I can't choose DOWN next.

So in our case, after making a first move of UP or DOWN, the next moves have certain restrictions.

Let's consider moving UP first:

Move 1: UP → (0,4). Now the head is at (0,4), direction is UP. The body will then update by adding the old head (0,3) to the front of the body list, and since we didn't eat an apple (the apple is at (9,3)), we remove the tail.

So new body after move 1 would be [(0,3)] + original body without the last segment. Wait no—the body was given as [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. So when moving UP, the old head is (0,3). The new head is (0,4). Then, we add the old head to the front of the body list. But wait—the body list in the input starts with (1,3), which is behind the current head at (0,3). So after moving UP, the body becomes [(0,3)] followed by the previous body segments except the last one.

Wait, no—step 3a says insert old head at front of BODY. Then step 3b: if new_head == apple, grow; else, remove tail. Since we're not eating the apple here, we remove the tail. So original body is [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. After adding old head (0,3) to front, it becomes [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)], and then we remove the last element because we're not growing. So new body is [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)].

Wait no—original body in input is [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. When moving to (0,4) via UP:

- The old head is (0,3).
- Insert it at front of body: new body becomes [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)].
- Since new_head != apple position, we remove the tail, which is (2,2). So the body becomes [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)].

So after move 1: head is at (0,4), direction is UP. Body is [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)]. 

Now, for the next move, since current direction is UP, we can't choose DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.

If I move RIGHT from here: new head would be (1,4). Is this position safe? Let's check against body segments. The body after first move includes (0,3), (1,3), etc., so none of them is at (1,4) except the body segment at (1,4), but wait—the body list now has (1,4) as one of the segments.

Wait, in step 2 of movement rules: Check if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So after moving UP, the body is [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)]. The tail is at (2,3). When we make a new move, the tail may or may not move depending on whether we eat an apple.

So in this case, moving RIGHT to (1,4): the body has (1,4) as one of its segments. So new_head would be (1,4), which is already part of the body—so collision occurs. Therefore, can't move RIGHT here.

Alternatively, if I move LEFT from (0,4): new head is (-1,4), which is out of bounds—invalid.

So after moving UP to (0,4), possible next directions are LEFT or RIGHT, but both seem invalid because moving RIGHT would cause collision and moving LEFT would be out of bounds. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the body update. Let me recheck:

After move 1: head is at (0,4). The old head was (0,3), which is added to the front of the body list. Original body was [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. So new body after adding old head becomes [(0,3)] + original body → [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. Then, since we didn't eat apple, remove tail: [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)].

So body is now [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)]. So when considering move to (1,4), which is in the body list, that would cause collision. Hence, can't move RIGHT from (0,4). 

Therefore, moving UP first leads us into a position where next moves are limited. Maybe starting with DOWN instead.

Move 1: DOWN → (0,2). Now head is at (0,2), direction is DOWN. Body updates:

- Old head is (0,3).
- Insert to front of body: [(0,3)] + original body → [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)].
- Since new_head != apple, remove tail → [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)].

So body after move 1 is [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)]. 

Now, current direction is DOWN. Next possible moves can't be UP because that would reverse the direction? Wait no—current direction is DOWN; reversing would be choosing UP as next move.

Wait according to rule 2: If current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN next, and vice versa for LEFT and RIGHT. So if current direction is DOWN, next move can't be UP.

So after moving DOWN, possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.

Moving LEFT from (0,2) would take us to (-1,2), which is out of bounds—invalid.

Moving RIGHT: new_head → (1,2). Check for collision with body segments. The body after first move includes [(0,3), (1,3), etc.]. So (1,2) isn't in the body, so that's safe.

So after moving RIGHT to (1,2), direction is now RIGHT. Now, check if we can proceed further rightwards.

Now, head is at (1,2). Body is [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)]. Wait no—after first move, body was [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)], but after moving DOWN and then RIGHT, the head is at (1,2). So new_head is (1,2).

After this move:

- Old head is (0,2).
- Insert to front of body: [(0,2)] + current body → [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)].
- Since new_head != apple, remove tail → [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].

Wait no—the body before this move was [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)]. After moving RIGHT to (1,2):

- Insert old head (0,2) at front: [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)].
- Remove tail → [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].

So body is now [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)]. 

Now, head is at (1,2). Next move can't be LEFT because current direction is RIGHT; moving LEFT would reverse the direction? Wait no—current direction is RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT. So possible directions are UP or DOWN.

Wait no—the rule says you can't choose the exact opposite direction of your current movement. Since we're moving RIGHT now (direction is RIGHT), the next move can't be LEFT.

So from (1,2), after moving RIGHT to (1,2), next possible moves are UP and DOWN, but not LEFT or RIGHT again?

Wait no—current direction is RIGHT. So next move can't be LEFT because that's reversing. But according to rule 2: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is LEFT, you may not choose RIGHT; similarly for UP/DOWN. So when moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.

So from (1,2), facing RIGHT, next moves can be UP or DOWN.

If I move UP from here: new head → (1,3). Check collision with body segments. The body includes (0,3), (1,3), etc. So (1,3) is in the body—collision occurs. Can't move UP.

Moving DOWN: new head → (1,1). Is that safe? Body after this move would be [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)]. So (1,1) isn't in the body—safe. 

So moving DOWN to (1,1):

- Old head is (1,2).
- Insert at front of body: [(1,2)] + current body → [(1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].
- Remove tail → [(1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)].

So new body is [(1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)]. Head at (1,1). 

Now, current direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP because that's reversing.

Possible directions: LEFT or RIGHT.

Moving LEFT from (1,1): new head → (0,1). Check collision—body includes (0,2) but not (0,1)—safe. So possible.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT: new head → (2,1). Safe as well, because body doesn't have (2,1).

But let's think about the longer-term strategy. The apple is at (9,3), which is much further to the right and same y-coordinate as current position. To reach it, perhaps we need to get into a straight path towards it without getting blocked by our own body.

This seems complicated because each move affects the body, making the path planning tricky. Maybe starting with UP isn't the best idea because it leads us into a dead end quickly.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT from (0,3) isn't allowed initially because current direction is LEFT, and next move can't be RIGHT. So we have to go either UP or DOWN first.

But given that after moving DOWN and then RIGHT, we get to (1,2), which allows further moves towards the right. Perhaps this path could work.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach: what's the minimal number of moves needed? The snake needs to move from x=0 to x=9 on y=3. Each move can change x or y by 1.

But considering that each move may be blocked by the body, which is behind.

Alternatively, perhaps after a few initial moves to get out of the way, we can start moving rightwards towards the apple without collision.

Wait, but the current body is in such a way that it's spread out. Maybe if we go UP and then RIGHT, but as I saw earlier, moving UP leads us into a position where next move is blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving DOWN to (0,2), then moving RIGHT to (1,2), then RIGHT again to (2,2). But wait, can't move RIGHT again because current direction is RIGHT—no, you can choose any direction except the reverse of previous. So from RIGHT direction, next moves can be UP or DOWN.

Wait no—the rule says that after moving in a certain direction, you can't change to its exact opposite. So if I'm moving RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT, but other directions are allowed.

So perhaps after moving RIGHT to (1,2), then I can choose to go UP or DOWN again.

But let's try to plan the path step by step:

Move 1: DOWN → (0,2). Body becomes [(0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)].
Move 2: RIGHT → (1,2). Body becomes [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].
Move 3: DOWN → (1,1). Body becomes [(1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)].
Now at (1,1), direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP.

Move 4: RIGHT → (2,1). Safe, body doesn't have (2,1).
Body becomes [(1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)].
Now at (2,1), direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

Move 5: DOWN → (2,0). Safe.
But moving further down isn't helpful for reaching y=3.

Alternatively, from (2,1):

Move 5: UP → (2,2). Check collision: body after previous moves includes [(1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)]. So (2,2) isn't in the body—safe.

So move 5: UP to (2,2). Body becomes [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3)].
Now at (2,2), direction is UP. Next move can't be DOWN.

Move 6: RIGHT → (3,2). Safe.
Body becomes [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2)].

This seems to be getting us somewhere towards the apple at (9,3), but it's a long way and we might get blocked by our own body later on.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient path. Since this is becoming too complex, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach or realize that with each move, the snake grows, making it harder to maneuver without collision unless careful planning is done.

Another idea: after moving DOWN and RIGHT a few times, can we make the body curve in such a way that allows us to proceed straight towards the apple?

But honestly, this seems too involved for a manual calculation. Perhaps I should instead outline the moves step by step as best as possible.

Alternatively, considering that the snake starts at (0,3), and needs to reach (9,3). The minimal path is 9 moves to the right, but since the snake grows, each move increases its length by one, so it's impossible unless we can navigate without overlapping our body.

But with the initial body configuration, moving directly right isn't possible because after first move in a different direction, the next move to the right would be blocked by the old body.

Wait no—after moving DOWN and then RIGHT, as I did earlier, perhaps we can eventually get into a position where we can proceed right without collision.

Alternatively, maybe starting with LEFT is impossible due to boundary. So only UP or DOWN first.

But given that after each move, the snake's head moves and body follows, making it difficult.

Wait, but in the initial state, the snake is at (0,3), with body extending perhaps? Or is it just a single cell?

Assuming it's a single cell, then movement would be straightforward. But the problem says "you are the head of the snake," so probably the rest of the snake follows.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify: in this context, is the snake's body lengthening as it moves? Or is it just moving forward without growing?

The initial question doesn't specify whether the snake grows or not. It says "you are the head of the snake," which suggests that you're controlling the movement, and presumably, the rest of the snake follows.

But since it's about avoiding collision with its own body, I think the snake must have a body that follows after each move, thus increasing in length as time goes on. So in this case, moving too much without creating space could cause self-collision.

Given that, maybe a better strategy is to make the snake turn in such a way that it can proceed straight towards the apple without overlapping itself.

But considering the complexity, perhaps I should outline the initial moves and see if a path exists.

Alternatively, given the time constraints, perhaps the answer is that it's impossible because after certain moves, the snake would block its own path. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no—if you move carefully, it's possible to navigate through.

But perhaps in this specific case, due to starting position and needing to reach (9,3), which is 9 cells away, while each move adds one cell to the body, so after 9 moves, the snake would be 10 cells long, which could potentially block itself.

Alternatively, perhaps by making a U-turn or some maneuver, you can get through.

But honestly, I think that it's possible with careful planning. The minimal number of moves required is 9, but considering growth and potential blocking, maybe more.

However, since the problem is presented as a challenge to find the sequence, I'll proceed to outline the step-by-step moves assuming that it's possible.

First move: DOWN to (0,2).
Second move: RIGHT to (1,2).
Third move: DOWN to (1,1).
Fourth move: RIGHT to (2,1).
Fifth move: UP to (2,2).
Sixth move: RIGHT to (3,2).
Seventh move: UP to (3,3).
Eighth move: RIGHT to (4,3).
... and so on until reaching (9,3).

But I need to check for collisions at each step.

Let me try:

Move 1: DOWN → (0,2). Body is [(0,3), (0,2)].
Move 2: RIGHT → (1,2). Body becomes [(0,2), (0,3), (1,2)].
Move 3: DOWN → (1,1). Body becomes [(1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1)].
Move 4: RIGHT → (2,1). Body becomes [(1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (2,1)].
Move 5: UP → (2,2). Check collision: body is [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3)]. So (2,2) isn't in the body—safe. Body becomes [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2)].
Move 6: RIGHT → (3,2). Safe. Body becomes [(3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)].
Move 7: UP → (3,3). Check collision: body includes up to (1,2)—safe. Body becomes [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1)].
Now at (3,3). From here, need to move right towards (9,3).

Move 8: RIGHT → (4,3). Safe.
Body becomes [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1)].
Move 9: RIGHT → (5,3).
...
Continuing this way until reaching (9,3).

Each time moving right without collision because the body is trailing behind and not blocking the path.

Thus, the sequence would be:

1. DOWN
2. RIGHT
3. DOWN
4. RIGHT
5. UP
6. RIGHT
7. UP
8. RIGHT
... continuing RIGHT until reaching x=9.

But wait, after move 7, we are at (3,3). Then moving right each time to reach (9,3) in moves 8-12: total of 10 moves? Let me count:

From (3,3), need to go to (4,3): move 8.

Then (5,3): move 9.

(6,3): move 10.

(7,3): move 11.

(8,3): move 12.

(9,3): move 13.

So total of 13 moves. But each move adds to the body length. However, since we're moving in a straight line after (3,3), and the body is behind us, it shouldn't block our path.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

But let's list them step by step with coordinates to ensure no collision:

Move 1: DOWN → (0,2)
Body: [(0,3), (0,2)]

Move 2: RIGHT → (1,2)
Body: [(0,2), (0,3), (1,2)]

Move 3: DOWN → (1,1)
Body: [(1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1)]

Move 4: RIGHT → (2,1)
Body: [(1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (2,1)]

Move 5: UP → (2,2)
Body: [(2,2), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3)]

Move 6: RIGHT → (3,2)
Body: [(3,2), (2,2), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2)]

Move 7: UP → (3,3)
Body: [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,1), (1,2)]

Move 8: RIGHT → (4,3)
Body: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,1)]

Move 9: RIGHT → (5,3)
Body: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2)]

Move 10: RIGHT → (6,3)
Body: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2)]

Move 11: RIGHT → (7,3)
Body: [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]

Move 12: RIGHT → (8,3)
Body: [(8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]

Move 13: RIGHT → (9,3)
Body: [(9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3)]

At this point, the snake's head is at (9,3) without colliding with its body. So yes, it's possible.

Therefore, the moves are as follows:

1. DOWN
2. RIGHT
3. DOWN
4. RIGHT
5. UP
6. RIGHT
7. UP
8. RIGHT
9. RIGHT
10. RIGHT
11. RIGHT
12. RIGHT
13. RIGHT

But to present it clearly, the sequence can be summarized as:

DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, followed by five consecutive RIGHTS.

So the step-by-step moves are:

1. Move DOWN to (0,2)
2. Move RIGHT to (1,2)
3. Move DOWN to (1,1)
4. Move RIGHT to (2,1)
5. Move UP to (2,2)
6. Move RIGHT to (3,2)
7. Move UP to (3,3)
8. Move RIGHT to (4,3)
9. Move RIGHT to (5,3)
10. Move RIGHT to (6,3)
11. Move RIGHT to (7,3)
12. Move RIGHT to (8,3)
13. Move RIGHT to (9,3)

This sequence ensures that the snake doesn't collide with its own body while moving from (0,3) to (9,3).
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from the starting position at (0, 3) to the target position at (9, 3) without colliding with its own body. The snake can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, but it cannot move into a position that overlaps with any part of its body.

### Approach
The key idea is to carefully plan each move to ensure the snake's head does not collide with its body. By strategically moving the snake through a series of turns and then proceeding straight towards the target, we can avoid self-collisions while efficiently reaching the destination.

1. **Initial Moves**: Start by moving DOWN and RIGHT to create space for the snake's body.
2. **Body Management**: Continue moving in such a way that the snake's body does not block its path. This involves making turns (DOWN, RIGHT, UP) to maneuver around potential collisions.
3. **Straight Path**: Once positioned correctly, move straight RIGHT until reaching the target position at (9, 3).

### Solution Code
```python
# The solution is a sequence of moves that leads the snake from (0, 3) to (9, 3) without collision.

moves = [
    'DOWN',   # Move 1: DOWN to (0,2)
    'RIGHT',  # Move 2: RIGHT to (1,2)
    'DOWN',   # Move 3: DOWN to (1,1)
    'RIGHT',  # Move 4: RIGHT to (2,1)
    'UP',     # Move 5: UP to (2,2)
    'RIGHT',  # Move 6: RIGHT to (3,2)
    'UP',     # Move 7: UP to (3,3)
    'RIGHT',  # Move 8: RIGHT to (4,3)
    'RIGHT',  # Move 9: RIGHT to (5,3)
    'RIGHT',  # Move 10: RIGHT to (6,3)
    'RIGHT',  # Move 11: RIGHT to (7,3)
    'RIGHT',  # Move 12: RIGHT to (8,3)
    'RIGHT'   # Move 13: RIGHT to (9,3)
]

# The moves list contains the sequence of directions from index 0 to 12.
```

### Explanation
- **Move 1**: Moving DOWN from (0, 3) to (0, 2) positions the snake below its initial position.
- **Move 2**: Moving RIGHT from (0, 2) to (1, 2) starts the snake's movement towards the target while keeping it one step away from the boundary.
- **Move 3**: Another DOWN move takes the snake to (1, 1), creating more space below.
- **Move 4**: Moving RIGHT again places the snake at (2, 1), further extending its position.
- **Move 5**: An UP move brings the snake back up to (2, 2), avoiding collision with its body which is trailing behind.
- **Move 6**: Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) continues the progression towards the target.
- **Move 7**: Another UP move takes the snake to (3, 3), aligning it vertically with the target column.
- **Moves 8-13**: The snake then moves straight RIGHT five times to reach the final destination at (9, 3).

This sequence ensures that each move is safe and avoids any self-collisions while efficiently reaching the target position.
