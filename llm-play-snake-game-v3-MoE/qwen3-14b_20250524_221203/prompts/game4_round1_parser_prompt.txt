<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (8,6). The grid is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. The body is empty, so the snake is just the head. Wait, the body cells list is empty. So the snake is length 1. That's important. Because when moving, the body doesn't block anything except when the snake grows.

First, I need to find a path from (5,5) to (8,6) without colliding with the body. Since the body is empty, the only possible collision is if the snake moves into a position that would cause it to hit itself after growing. But since the body is empty, the initial moves are straightforward.

The apple is at (8,6). The head needs to get there. The Manhattan distance is (8-5) + (6-5) = 3 + 1 = 4. So the minimal steps would be 4, but need to check for possible obstacles.

But since the snake is length 1, moving directly towards the apple should be safe. However, I need to make sure that after eating the apple, the snake has a legal move. Because when the apple is eaten, the body grows, so the next move must not cause the head to collide with the new body.

Let's think step by step.

Current head: (5,5). Direction is NONE. So first move can be any direction, but can't reverse (but since current direction is NONE, that's not an issue). The apple is at (8,6). So from (5,5), moving right or up would be towards the apple.

Let me plan a path. Let's try moving right three times to reach x=8, then up once to y=6.

So the moves would be RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP.

Check each step:

1. Move RIGHT to (6,5). Body is empty. No collision. After moving, the body becomes [(5,5)] (since the snake grows only when eating the apple). But since the apple hasn't been eaten yet, the body is just the old head. Wait, no. Wait, the movement rules: when moving, the body is updated. Let me recall.

When the snake moves, the new head is computed. Then, the body is updated. If the snake eats the apple, the body grows. Otherwise, the tail is removed.

In the first move, the snake is length 1. So the body list is empty. When moving, the new head is (6,5). Then, since the body is empty, inserting the old head (5,5) at the front. Then, since the snake hasn't eaten the apple, the tail is removed. But since the body was empty, after inserting the old head, the body becomes [(5,5)], and then removing the tail (which is the only element), so the body becomes empty again. So after the first move, the body is still empty. So the snake is still length 1.

So moving right three times would take the head to (8,5), then moving up to (8,6), which is the apple. Let's check each step.

First move: RIGHT to (6,5). No collision. Body is empty. Then, the body after moving: insert old head (5,5) into body list (which was empty), so body becomes [(5,5)], then since no apple, remove the tail (so body becomes empty again). So the snake is still length 1.

Second move: RIGHT to (7,5). Same process. No collision. Body remains empty.

Third move: RIGHT to (8,5). Still no collision. Body remains empty.

Fourth move: UP to (8,6). That's the apple. Now, when moving, the new head is (8,6). Check for collision: the body is empty, so no collision. Then, since the new head is at the apple, the body grows. So the body is updated by inserting the old head (8,5) at the front of the body list (which was empty), so body becomes [(8,5)]. Since the apple was eaten, the tail is not removed. So the body is now [(8,5)], and the head is (8,6). So the snake is now length 2.

Now, after eating the apple, the next move must be safe. The snake's body is [(8,5)], and the head is (8,6). The next move can't be DOWN (since the body is at (8,5), which is directly below the head. If the snake moves DOWN, the new head would be (8,5), which is the same as the body's first element. But according to the collision rules, the head can't move into a body cell that is not the tail's current cell when it's about to move. Wait, the body is [(8,5)], and the tail is that cell. When moving, the tail will move. Let me check the collision rules again.

In step 2 of the movement update: check if new_head is outside grid or coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

Wait, the body list is from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So in this case, the body is [(8,5)], which is the segment behind the head. So the tail is (8,5). When moving, the tail will move. So when checking for collision, the new_head can't be the same as any body segment except the tail's current cell when it moves. Wait, the rule says if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

Wait, the tail's current cell is (8,5). When the tail moves, it will be removed. So, when the snake is growing (after eating the apple), the body is [(8,5)], and the new head is (8,6). The next move: suppose the snake moves DOWN. The new head would be (8,5). At that point, the body is [(8,5)], and the tail is (8,5). So when moving, the new head is (8,5), which is the same as the tail's current cell. But according to the collision rules, the head can't move into a body cell that is not the tail's current cell when that tail will move. Wait, the tail's current cell is (8,5). When moving, the tail will move (since the snake is not growing anymore). Wait, after eating the apple, the body is [(8,5)], and the head is (8,6). The next move: the snake is length 2. So when moving, the body is updated. Let's think.

When the snake is at (8,6) with body [(8,5)], and the next move is DOWN. The new head would be (8,5). Now, check for collision. The body is [(8,5)], which is the segment behind the head. The new head (8,5) is the same as the first body cell (8,5). But according to the collision rules, the snake dies if the new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

In this case, the body is [(8,5)], which is the segment immediately behind the head. The tail is (8,5). When the snake moves, the tail will move. So the tail's current cell is (8,5), and when moving, it will be removed. So the new_head (8,5) is the same as the current tail's cell. But the rule says that if the new head is the same as any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So in this case, the new_head is the same as the tail's current cell. Since the tail will move (i.e., be removed), then the new_head is allowed? Wait, the rule says that if the new head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So the tail's current cell is (8,5), and when the tail moves, that cell will be vacated. Therefore, if the new_head is (8,5), which is the tail's current cell, but the tail will move (so that cell is vacated), then it's allowed?

Wait, the rule says that the snake dies if the new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So if the new_head is the same as a body cell that is not the tail's current cell, it's a collision. But if it's the tail's current cell, then it's allowed because when the tail moves, that cell will be vacated.

In this case, the body is [(8,5)], which is the tail. So the new_head is (8,5), which is the tail's current cell. Therefore, it's allowed. Wait, but in that case, when the snake moves down, the new head is (8,5), which is the same as the tail's current cell. However, the body is [(8,5)], and when moving, the body is updated. Let me think through the movement steps.

After eating the apple, the snake is at head (8,6), body [(8,5)]. Now, the next move is DOWN. The new head is (8,5). Check collision: the new head is (8,5), which is the same as the tail's current cell (8,5). Since the tail is about to move (i.e., be removed), this is allowed? Because the rule says that the head can't move into a body cell that is not the tail's current cell when it moves. So if the new head is the tail's current cell, then it's allowed. Therefore, moving down would be allowed? But that would cause the head to be at (8,5), and the body would be [(8,5)], then inserting the old head (8,6) into the body list. Wait, the movement steps:

When moving down to (8,5), the new head is (8,5). The body is [(8,5)]. So inserting the old head (8,6) into the body list: the body becomes [(8,6), (8,5)]. Then, since the snake is not eating an apple, the tail is removed. The tail is (8,5), so the body becomes [(8,6)]. So the new head is (8,5), and the body is [(8,6)]. So the snake's head is (8,5), and the body is [(8,6)]. That's okay. But the head is at (8,5), and the body is at (8,6). So no collision. So that's allowed.

But in that case, moving down after eating the apple is allowed. However, the problem is that the next move could be problematic. But according to the rules, the move is allowed.

But perhaps the initial path is safe. Let me check again.

The initial path is RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP. That would take the snake to the apple. After that, the snake is at (8,6), body [(8,5)]. Now, the next move can be any direction except down (if that's allowed). Wait, but according to the above analysis, moving down is allowed. However, the problem is that the snake is now length 2, and the head is at (8,6), body [(8,5)]. So the next move, if the snake moves down, the head is (8,5), and the body is [(8,6)]. So no collision. So that's allowed.

But the problem is that after eating the apple, the snake has to have a valid move. In this case, the next move can be any direction except for moving into the body. But since the body is [(8,5)], the snake can move in any direction except into (8,5). But the head is at (8,6). So if the snake moves down, it goes to (8,5), which is the body's position. Wait, no. Wait, the body is [(8,5)], and the head is at (8,6). When moving down, the new head is (8,5). The body is [(8,5)], but during the collision check, the new head is the same as the tail's current position. But the tail is about to move, so it's allowed. Therefore, the move is allowed.

However, this seems a bit counterintuitive. Maybe the initial path is safe, but perhaps there's a better way. Let's think of another path.

Alternative path: move up once to (5,6), then right three times. Let's see:

Move 1: UP to (5,6). Then move RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT to (8,6). Let's check.

First move: UP to (5,6). No collision. Body remains empty.

Second move: RIGHT to (6,6). No collision.

Third move: RIGHT to (7,6).

Fourth move: RIGHT to (8,6). Eats apple. Now, the body is [(8,6 -1 step? Wait, the old head was (7,6) before moving to (8,6). So after eating the apple, the body is [(7,6)]. The head is (8,6). Now, the next move can't be LEFT (since the body is [(7,6)], and moving left would take the head to (7,6), which is the body's position. But according to the collision rules, the new head is (7,6), which is a body cell (the first element in the body list, which is not the tail's current cell. Wait, the body is [(7,6)], and the tail is (7,6). When moving, the tail will move. So when the new head is (7,6), which is the tail's current cell, and since the tail is about to move, it's allowed. Therefore, moving left is allowed. However, the body after moving would be [(8,6), (7,6)], and then the tail is removed (since the snake didn't eat the apple again), so the body becomes [(8,6)]. So the head is (7,6), and the body is [(8,6)]. No collision. So that's allowed.

But again, this seems okay. However, the problem is that after eating the apple, the snake must have at least one valid move. But in both cases, the snake can move in some direction. Therefore, the initial path of moving right three times and up once is valid.

But wait, what if the snake moves in a different direction after eating the apple? For example, if the snake moves right again after eating the apple. Let's see.

After eating the apple, the head is at (8,6), body [(8,5)]. If the snake moves right, the new head is (9,6). No collision. That's allowed. So that's a valid move.

So the initial path is safe.

Therefore, the answer is RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP.

But let's confirm each step again.

Step 1: Move RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5). Body is empty. After moving, body is [(5,5)] (inserted), then since no apple, remove the tail (so body is empty again). So the snake is length 1.

Step 2: Move RIGHT from (6,5) to (7,5). Same process. Body remains empty.

Step 3: Move RIGHT from (7,5) to (8,5). Body remains empty.

Step 4: Move UP from (8,5) to (8,6). Now, check collision: body is empty. No collision. Since the new head is at the apple, the body is updated by inserting the old head (8,5) into the body list (which was empty), so body becomes [(8,5)]. Since the apple was eaten, no tail is removed. So the body is [(8,5)], and the head is (8,6). Now, the snake is length 2.

After this, the next move can be any direction that doesn't cause a collision. For example, moving right, left, up, or down (as discussed earlier).

So the moves are correct.

Therefore, the answer is RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP. So the sequence is four moves: three rights and one up.
</think>

To navigate the head of the snake from its initial position at **(5,5)** to the apple located at **(8,6)**, we must consider the movement rules and the fact that the snake is initially of **length 1**, with an empty body list.

---

### Movement Rules Recap:

- **New head position** is computed based on the direction.
- The **body** is updated by inserting the **old head** at the front of the body.
- If the **new head is on the apple**, the **body grows** (no tail is removed).
- Otherwise, the **tail is removed** (body length remains the same).
- The snake **cannot** move into a body segment that is **not the tail's current position**.

---

### Path Analysis:

The shortest path from **(5,5)** to **(8,6)** is 4 steps: 3 steps to the **right** and 1 step **up**.

Let’s simulate the movement step-by-step:

1. **Move Right → (6,5)**  
   - Body: `[]` → Insert old head `(5,5)` → Body becomes `[(5,5)]`  
   - No apple eaten → Remove tail → Body becomes `[]`  
   - **Valid move**

2. **Move Right → (7,5)**  
   - Same process as above → **Valid move**

3. **Move Right → (8,5)**  
   - Same process → **Valid move**

4. **Move Up → (8,6)**  
   - Apple is at this position  
   - Insert old head `(8,5)` into body → Body becomes `[(8,5)]`  
   - **No tail is removed** (because apple was eaten)  
   - **Valid move**

---

### Post-Apple Considerations:

After reaching the apple, the snake is at position **(8,6)** with body `[(8,5)]`. The next move must not cause the head to collide with any body segment **except** the **tail's current position**, which is **(8,5)**.

- If the snake moves **down**, the new head would be **(8,5)**, which is the **tail's current position** → **Allowed**.
- The snake can still move in other directions (e.g., **left**, **right**, **up**) without collision.

Therefore, the snake has a valid continuation after reaching the apple.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
