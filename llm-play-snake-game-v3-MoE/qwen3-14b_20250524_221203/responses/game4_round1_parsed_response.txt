{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (5, 5) and moves right three times to reach (8, 5). Then it moves up to reach the apple located at (8, 6). The snake can't move into a body segment that is not the tail's current position, but in this case, the snake doesn't have a tail initially. After eating the apple, the snake has valid continuation with any direction except down."}
