========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, I'm controlling a snake in the classic Snake game on a 10x10 grid. The goal is to move the snake's head from (5,6) to eat the apple at (5,7). I need to plan a safe path that avoids collisions with the body and walls, doesn't reverse direction immediately, and ensures there's still a way to move after eating the apple.

First, let me look at the current state:

- Head position: (5,6)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body cells: [(6,1), (6,2), ..., (6,6)] – so the body is a vertical line from y=1 to y=6 along x=6.
- Apple position: (5,7)

The head is currently at (5,6). The apple is directly to the right of the head. However, since the current direction is LEFT, I can't immediately turn around and go RIGHT because that would be reversing direction.

Wait, no. Let me check the movement rules again. Rule 3 says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if it's moving LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT. But wait, in this case, the current direction is LEFT, but the apple is to the right of the head. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Wait, the body cells are [(6,1), (6,2), ..., (6,6)]. So the body is a vertical line at x=6 from y=1 to y=6. The head is at (5,6). That means the snake is moving upwards along x=6, and the tail is at (6,1). 

So, the current direction is LEFT, meaning that the snake's last move was to the left, bringing the head to (5,6), and the body follows accordingly. So, from this state, what can I do?

I need to get the head to (5,7) without colliding with the body or walls. But first, let's think about movement constraints.

Since the direction is LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT. So after moving LEFT, the possible next moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again. Wait no: the current direction is LEFT, so the next move can't be opposite (RIGHT), but it can be any other direction except for NONE? Or does "NONE" mean that on the first move, you can choose any direction?

Wait, rule 3 says if the direction is "NONE", any move is allowed. But here, the current direction is LEFT, so in the next step, I can't turn RIGHT. Wait, no: the snake cannot reverse direction. So if it's moving LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT because that would be reversing.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify rule 3: "The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If the direction is NONE, any move is allowed." So, if current direction is LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT, but it can be any other direction except for the opposite.

Wait no. Wait, the example says: "If the direction is 'NONE', any move is allowed." So when direction isn't NONE, you can change direction as long as you don't reverse.

So in this case, current direction is LEFT. Next move cannot be RIGHT because that's reversing. But can it turn UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT?

Yes. Because those are not the opposite direction of LEFT.

Wait no: The movement directions are LEFT and RIGHT being opposites, UP and DOWN being opposites. So if moving LEFT, next can't be RIGHT, but can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

So from (5,6) with current direction LEFT, possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.

But wait, let's see the grid. If I move LEFT from (5,6), that would take me to (4,6). Is (4,6) a valid position? Well, as long as it's within 0 ≤ x <10 and 0 ≤ y <10. So yes.

But then, moving LEFT again might lead the head into the body or beyond. Let's check.

The body is at x=6 from y=1 to y=6. The head is at (5,6), which is one cell left of the body cells.

If I move LEFT again to (4,6), then the new head position is (4,6). Then the body would shift: the old head (5,6) becomes part of the body, and the tail (6,1) is removed. But since we didn't eat an apple, the body remains at length 5.

Wait, no: The body cells given are [(6,1), (6,2), ..., (6,6)]. So that's 6 cells from y=1 to y=6. Including the head? Wait, the body cells list excludes the head. Because in the movement update, after moving, the new head is added, and then the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

Wait, the problem statement says: "Body cells: List of (x,y) positions occupied by the snake's body (excluding the head)."

So currently, the body is [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]. So that's 6 cells. Wait, but a snake of length N has N+1 segments (head + body). So if the body is 6 cells, then the total length is 7.

Wait no: Let me think again. The body cells list excludes the head. So in this case, there are 6 body cells plus the head. So the total snake is 7 cells long.

So when moving, each step adds a new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So, if I move LEFT from (5,6) to (4,6), then the new head is at (4,6). The body will now include the previous head (5,6) as part of the body. So the new body becomes [(5,6)] + [the rest], but wait, no.

Wait, when moving, the old head moves in the direction to become a new body cell, and each existing body cell shifts forward. The tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

So in this case, after moving LEFT:

- New head: (4,6)
- Body becomes [(5,6), (6,1), (6,2), ..., (6,6)]? Wait no.

Wait, the initial body is [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)], and head at (5,6). So when moving LEFT:

- New head: (5 - 1, 6) = (4,6)
- The body cells update as follows: each cell moves in the direction of the previous head.

Wait no. Each segment of the body follows the movement of the previous one. So after moving, the new body is [old_head] + all other body cells except the tail, unless apple was eaten.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it step by step.

Let me think: current state:

Head: (5,6)

Body: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]

So the snake is a straight line from (6,1) up to (6,6), with head at (5,6).

If I move LEFT:

- New head: (4,6)

- Then, each body cell moves in the direction towards the previous head.

Wait no. Each segment of the body follows the path of the previous one. So after moving LEFT, the new body would be [ (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), ..., (6,6) ]? Or wait, perhaps the body is a queue that shifts as the head moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when the head moves, each body cell takes the position of the previous one. So after moving, the new body cells are [ (5,6), (6,1), ..., (6,6) ]? No, because that doesn't make sense in terms of order.

Alternatively, perhaps the body is a list where each segment follows the movement. For example:

- Original head: (5,6)
- Body: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]

When moving LEFT to (4,6):

- New head: (4,6)

- The previous head (5,6) becomes the new first body cell.

- Then, each subsequent body cell follows: so the new body is [(5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]? Wait, but that would lose the last cell (6,6). No, because if an apple isn't eaten, the tail is removed.

Wait, in movement rules: "Tail is removed unless apple is eaten."

So, after moving LEFT:

- New head: (4,6)
- Body becomes [(5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] – because the tail (6,6) is removed.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because moving from (5,6) to (4,6) in LEFT direction would mean the body cells shift left as well? Or no.

Wait, perhaps each segment of the body follows the movement direction of the head. So when the head moves LEFT, each body cell also moves in their own way towards the new position.

But that might not be the case. It's more likely that each segment follows the path, so the snake moves as a whole.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to model the possible movements step by step.

Let me think about what happens when I move LEFT:

- New head: (4,6)
- Body cells become [(5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]? Because the tail (6,6) is removed.

Wait, but that would make the body cells now include (5,6), which was previously the head. So the new body after moving LEFT would be:

Body: [ (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) ]

So total length remains 6 (body cells) plus new head =7.

But then, if I move again, let's say UP from (4,6):

- New head: (4,7)
- Body becomes [ (4,6), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ]
- Tail (6,5) is removed.

So the snake would be moving upwards now.

But wait, I need to get to (5,7). So from (5,6), perhaps I can't move directly LEFT because that would take me away from the apple. Hmm.

Wait, the apple is at (5,7), which is one cell UP from (5,6). But currently, the direction is LEFT, so the next move can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But moving LEFT might not be helpful because I need to get to the right of my current position. Alternatively, perhaps I should change direction after a few steps.

Wait, but I can't move RIGHT immediately after moving LEFT because that would reverse direction. So in the first step, if I'm moving LEFT, next moves cannot be RIGHT.

So let's think about possible paths:

Option 1: Turn UP as soon as possible to reach the apple.

But how?

Let me see:

Current position: (5,6), direction LEFT.

Possible first move: can't move RIGHT because that's reversing. So options are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

If I choose to move UP from (5,6):

- New head: (5,7) which is the apple! That's perfect. But wait, moving UP from (5,6) would take me to (5,7), which is where the apple is. So in this case, I can eat the apple.

But wait, can I do that? Let me check if it's allowed.

First, after moving LEFT, current direction is LEFT. So next move can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

So let's say I move UP from (5,6) to (5,7):

- New head: (5,7), which is the apple. So score increases by 1, and body grows by 1 segment.

But wait, after eating the apple, the tail isn't removed. So the body would now be:

Original body cells: [(6,1), (6,2), ..., (6,6)] plus new head (5,7). But wait, no. Let me think again.

When I move to eat the apple, the movement step is:

- New head: (5,7)
- The previous head (5,6) becomes part of the body.
- Since an apple was eaten, the tail isn't removed.

So the new body cells would be [(5,6), (6,1), (6,2), ..., (6,6)]. So now, the snake's length is 7 + 1 =8.

But I need to make sure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move left. Because the problem says: "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward."

So in this case, after moving UP to (5,7), can I still move further?

What's the new direction? It would be UP, since that was the last move.

The body is now [(5,6), (6,1), ..., (6,6)] plus head at (5,7). So wait, no: when moving to (5,7), the body cells are updated as follows:

- The old body cells were [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]. Head was at (5,6).

After moving UP to (5,7):

- New head: (5,7)
- Old head becomes part of body.
- Since apple is eaten, tail isn't removed.

So new body cells are [(5,6)] + [(6,1), (6,2), ..., (6,6)]. So total 7 body cells plus new head, making 8 segments.

Now, after eating the apple at (5,7), the direction is UP. Now, can I move further? Let's check if any adjacent cell is available.

From (5,7):

- Can I move LEFT to (4,7)? Is that blocked?

Looking at the body cells: [(5,6), (6,1), ..., (6,6)]. So (5,7) is the head. The next segment is (5,6), which is directly below.

So from (5,7), moving LEFT would take me to (4,7). Is that cell free? Let's see: body cells are [(5,6), (6,1), ..., (6,6)]. So none of these block (4,7). So yes, I can move LEFT again.

Alternatively, I could also move UP from (5,7) to (5,8), but that might not be necessary since I'm already at the apple's position.

But wait, is moving UP possible? From (5,7) moving UP would take me to (5,8). Is that blocked?

No, because the body cells are [(5,6), ...], which don't block (5,8).

So after eating the apple, I can still move. So this seems like a valid path.

But wait, let's check again: starting from (5,6), direction LEFT. Can I change direction to UP in the next step?

Yes, because moving LEFT is allowed, then moving UP is not reversing direction.

Wait no: if I'm at (5,7) after moving UP, the new direction is UP, so next moves can't be DOWN (reverse). But that's fine.

But wait, when you move, your direction changes to the direction you moved in. So from (5,6), if I move UP, my new direction is UP, not LEFT anymore.

So after moving UP once to eat the apple, my direction becomes UP. Then, any subsequent moves can't be DOWN.

Wait, but according to movement rules, when changing direction, as long as it's not reversing, you can change direction. So from LEFT, you can turn to UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT (since that would reverse).

So in this case, moving UP is allowed and doesn't reverse the direction.

Therefore, this seems like a valid path: move UP directly to eat the apple, with no problems afterward.

But wait, let me visualize:

Current state before moving:

Head: (5,6), Direction: LEFT

Body cells: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]

If I move UP to (5,7):

- New head: (5,7)
- Body cells now include (5,6) and all previous body cells except tail if no apple eaten. But since I ate the apple, tail remains.

So body becomes [ (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) ]

Now, direction is UP.

After eating, can I move further? Yes, because from (5,7), moving UP to (5,8) is possible and not blocked by body cells. Also, moving LEFT is possible as well.

So this seems like a valid one-step solution: move UP from (5,6) to eat the apple at (5,7).

But wait, why would I have to move in any other way? It's directly above.

Wait, but according to movement rules, can I change direction immediately? Because currently, the direction is LEFT. So moving UP is allowed because it's not a reverse.

Yes, moving from LEFT to UP is allowed (not reversing). So this should be possible.

Therefore, the minimal steps would be 1: move UP.

But let me double-check if there are any obstacles.

When I move UP from (5,6), the new head is at (5,7). The body cells after moving will include (5,6) and all previous body cells except the tail because an apple was eaten. Wait no—when you eat an apple, the tail isn't removed. So the body cells are [ (5,6) ] + [ (6,1), ..., (6,6) ], making 7 body cells.

Wait, but originally, the body was 6 cells. After moving, since we ate the apple, the body remains at 6 cells plus new head, so total 7 again? Or does eating an apple add a cell?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Let me clarify: when you eat an apple, you grow by one cell. So the movement step would be:

- Move to new position.
- Add the previous head as part of body.
- Since apple was eaten, do not remove tail.

So, in the initial state, the snake has 7 cells (6 body + head). After moving UP and eating the apple:

- New head: (5,7)
- Previous head becomes part of body: now body is [ (5,6), (6,1), ..., (6,6) ] =7 cells.
- Since apple was eaten, tail isn't removed. So total cells remain 8.

Wait no: original length is 7 (head + 6 body). After moving and eating, the new head adds one more cell without removing the tail, so now it's 8 cells.

But regardless, the key point is whether after moving UP to eat the apple, there are any legal moves left. And since from (5,7), I can move UP or LEFT, both of which are allowed and not blocked by body cells, it's safe.

Therefore, the minimal number of steps is 1: move UP directly to (5,7).

But wait, according to the initial state, the direction is LEFT. So when you move, your next direction becomes the direction you moved in. So moving from LEFT to UP changes the direction to UP, which is allowed.

Yes, this makes sense.

So the answer is 1 step: move UP.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimal number of steps required for a snake to reach an apple located at position (5,7) starting from its current head position at (5,6). The snake is initially moving in the LEFT direction and cannot reverse direction immediately.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake starts at position (5,6) with its body extending downward from (6,1) to (6,6). The goal is to reach (5,7), which is directly above the head.
2. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot move in the reverse direction immediately. From the LEFT direction, it can move UP or DOWN but not RIGHT.
3. **Optimal Path**: Since the apple is located directly above the head at (5,7), moving UP from (5,6) will allow the snake to reach the apple in a single step. This movement does not reverse the direction and is therefore allowed.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial position of the head
head = (5, 6)
# Target position of the apple
target = (5, 7)

# Determine the direction needed to move towards the target
dx, dy = 0, 1  # Represents moving UP

# Calculate new head position after moving in the determined direction
new_head = (head[0] + dx, head[1] + dy)
print(new_head)  # Output will be (5,7)

# The number of steps required is 1
steps = 1
print(steps)
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Position**: The snake's head starts at (5,6).
- **Movement Direction**: From LEFT direction, moving UP is allowed and directly leads to the target position.
- **Result**: Moving UP from (5,6) takes the head to (5,7) in one step, which is the minimal number of steps required.

This approach efficiently navigates the snake to the apple using a single optimal move.
