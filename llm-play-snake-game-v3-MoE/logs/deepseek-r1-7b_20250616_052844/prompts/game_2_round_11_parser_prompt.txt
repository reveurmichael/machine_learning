========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to move the snake from (3,8) towards the apple at (5,8). The snake is currently facing "UP", and its body is [(3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (1,6)]. So the head is at (3,8), and it's on a 10x10 grid. 

First, I need to understand how the movement works step by step. The snake moves based on its current direction, and each move involves updating the head and then shifting the body accordingly. Also, if the snake eats the apple, it doesn't lose its tail.

Since the goal is to reach (5,8), which is two cells directly to the right of the head, I think moving RIGHT twice should do the trick. But wait, can we move RIGHT twice without any issues?

Let's check each step:

1. **First Move: RIGHT**
   - Current direction is UP, but moving RIGHT means changing direction. Is that allowed? According to the rules, you can't reverse direction immediately after a move. So if the current direction is UP, moving RIGHT or LEFT would be okay because it's not the opposite (UP vs DOWN). Wait, no—the rule says you cannot reverse direction on the first move. The initial direction is UP; so for the first move, can we choose RIGHT?

Wait, actually, since this is the very first move after starting, the snake hasn't moved yet. So moving RIGHT from UP initially might be allowed because it's not a direct reversal (UP to RIGHT is a 90-degree turn). Let me double-check that.

Yes, according to the rules: "current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed." So after moving UP (initial direction), on the next move, we can't go DOWN. But RIGHT is okay.

So let's plan:
- Move RIGHT once.
   - New head position: (4,8)
   - Check for collisions: Is (4,8) occupied by any body segment? The current body is [(3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (1,6)], which doesn't include (4,8). So no collision.
- Update the body:
   - Insert head at front: new body becomes [(4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (1,6)]
   - Since we didn't eat the apple, remove the tail. The tail was (1,6). After removing it, the body is now length 5: [(4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6)]

So after first move RIGHT, head is at (4,8).

Now, second move:
   - Direction needs to be RIGHT again because we're moving towards the apple. Wait, but current direction was UP for the initial position; after moving RIGHT once, what's the new direction? The problem says that each movement uses the given direction vector based on the input "current direction". But in this case, I think the current direction is still UP until a move changes it.

Wait no—probably, the 'direction' refers to the intended direction for the next move. So after moving RIGHT once from the initial position facing UP, we need to decide what's our new direction. Since the snake was initially facing UP, but can't face DOWN immediately, but moving RIGHT is allowed.

But in this case, since the goal is directly to the right of the current head (from 3,8 to 5,8), after two moves RIGHT, we'll reach it.

So let's proceed:
- Second move: RIGHT again.
   - New head position: (5,8)
   - Check for collisions: (5,8) is our target apple. Since the snake hasn't eaten it yet, does it count as a collision? Wait no—apple is treated differently. The snake doesn't collide with itself if it's about to eat the apple.

Wait, according to movement rules:
- When moving into the apple position, the head can be there without considering body cells except for the tail when it moves this turn.
So since we are moving towards (5,8) and haven't eaten the apple yet, is that cell occupied by any body segment?

Looking at current body after first move: [(4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6)]. So (5,8) isn't in the body. Therefore, moving RIGHT again would be safe.

After moving:
   - New head is (5,8)
   - Insert at front: new body becomes [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6)]
   - Since we're eating the apple now, do not remove the tail. So body remains length 6.
   
Thus, after two moves RIGHT, the snake's head is at (5,8) where the apple is.

So the sequence of directions would be ["RIGHT", "RIGHT"].

I should make sure there are no collisions during these moves and that each step follows the rules correctly. Also, check if any future move would trap the snake after this path.

Wait a second—when moving RIGHT twice from (3,8), let's see:

First move:
- Head to (4,8). No collision. Body becomes [(4,8), followed by existing body without tail]. Then next move.

Second move:
- Head to (5,8). Since this is the apple position and we're not eating it yet (we need to eat it in the next step?), wait no—the rule says if new_head == apple position, it's safe as long as the collision check passes. So moving into (5,8) is acceptable because the apple isn't part of the body segments.

Wait, but after first RIGHT move:
- Current head is at (4,8)
- New head for second move would be (5,8), which is the apple's position. Since we are about to eat it, does that affect anything? No—because when you're moving towards it and aren't yet eating it.

But wait no—if new_head == apple, then after moving into it, do you check if there's a collision with any body cells except for the tail (if not growing)? Or is it allowed?

Looking back at movement rules:

2. **Check for collisions** (using state before body shifts):
   • If new_head is outside grid bounds: die.
   • If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn: die.

So if we are moving into apple position, which isn't in the current body segments, it should be fine. So yes, moving RIGHT twice seems safe.

Therefore, the path is two "RIGHT" moves.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake can move RIGHT twice because each step avoids collision with its body and does not trap itself. The first RIGHT move brings it to (4,8), then another RIGHT to reach the apple at (5,8)."
}
```
```

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 8) and whose body cells are in list format [(3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
