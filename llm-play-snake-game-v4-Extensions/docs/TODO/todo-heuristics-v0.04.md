## 2️⃣ CSV feature `target_move` uses `move` directly

This is okay in most cases, but if `move` was initially inconsistent with `game_state`, you might propagate that inconsistency into the CSV file.

### Suggestion

Validate `move` against `valid_moves` recomputed from `game_state`. If `move` is not valid, fail fast or fix.

## 3️⃣ `snake_positions` membership checks in `_format_prompt`

In `_format_prompt`, when determining `valid_moves`, you do:

```python
if (0 <= next_pos[0] < grid_size and
    0 <= next_pos[1] < grid_size and
    next_pos not in snake_positions):
```

But `snake_positions` is a list of lists; `next_pos` is a tuple. So `next_pos not in snake_positions` always evaluates True.

This could cause `valid_moves` to incorrectly include moves that would result in collisions.

### Suggestion

Convert `snake_positions` to set of tuples first:

```python
snake_body_set = set(tuple(p) for p in snake_positions)
```

Then check `next_pos not in snake_body_set`.

## 4️⃣ Possible reuse of stale metrics in explanations

In `_extract_jsonl_record`, you flatten the explanation and then update it. But if the original `explanation` dict contains "metrics" keys, you partially drop them. However, if any nested subtext or cached textual snippet (from an earlier model output) is stored inside, some metric numbers might remain.
