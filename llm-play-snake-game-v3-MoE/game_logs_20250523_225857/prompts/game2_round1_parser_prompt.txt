<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake is at (5,5) and the apple is at (2,1). The initial direction is "NONE", which means on the first move, I can choose any direction. My goal is to plan a path that gets the head to the apple without causing any collisions or reversals unless necessary.

First, let's understand the grid. It's a 10x10 grid with (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at the top-right. The snake starts at (5,5), which is in the middle. The apple is at (2,1), so it's to the left and down from the head.

Since the initial direction is "NONE", I can choose any of the four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let me consider each option:

1. **UP**: Moving up would take the snake towards higher y values. The apple is at (2,1), which is lower in both x and y, so moving up doesn't seem helpful.

2. **DOWN**: Similarly, moving down would increase the y value further, taking the snake away from the apple's position. So this might not be the best choice either.

3. **LEFT**: Moving left (decreasing x) seems towards the apple's x-coordinate of 2. This is a promising direction since it brings the snake closer to the apple's x-position.

4. **RIGHT**: Moving right would increase the x value, taking the snake away from the apple, so this isn't helpful.

So, moving left seems like the best initial move because it aligns the snake's movement towards the apple's x-coordinate.

After choosing LEFT, the new head position will be (4,5). I need to check if this new position causes any collisions. The body of the snake is currently empty except for the head, so there are no immediate body segments to collide with. Also, the new head isn't outside the grid bounds since x=4 and y=5 are within 0-9.

Next, I'll update the body positions. Since the snake didn't eat the apple (new_head is (4,5) and apple is at (2,1)), the tail will move forward. The old head position (5,5) is inserted at the front of the body list, making the new body list [(5,5)]. Then, the tail (which was non-existent before this move) would be removed, but since there's no tail to remove, the body remains just the new head.

Now, the snake is at (4,5), with no body segments. The next move should continue moving left towards the apple. Let me choose LEFT again. The new head position will be (3,5). Checking for collisions: the grid is within bounds, and there are no body segments to collide with.

Updating the body: Insert the old head (4,5) at the front, making the body list [(4,5)]. Since the snake didn't eat the apple, the tail is removed, but again, since there's no tail, the body remains only the new head. So now, the snake is at (3,5).

Continuing this pattern: choose LEFT each time. Next move to (2,5). Checking again, safe and within bounds. Updating body to [(3,5)]. Then, moving left to (1,5), making the body [(2,5)].

Now, the head is at (1,5). The apple is at (2,1), so I need to move further down. But wait, the current direction is LEFT. If I try to change direction, I have to consider the rule that you can't reverse directions unless it's necessary after eating an apple.

Since the snake hasn't eaten the apple yet, changing direction from LEFT to DOWN might be allowed if it doesn't cause a reversal. However, in this case, changing direction might not be needed immediately. Let me see what happens if I continue moving left.

Moving left again would take the head to (0,5). But that's as far left as possible, and the apple is at (2,1), which is two units to the right and four units down from here. So continuing left isn't helpful for reaching the apple.

Therefore, after reaching (1,5), I need to change direction to DOWN or RIGHT. Changing to RIGHT would allow me to move towards x=2, which is closer to the apple's x-coordinate. However, I have to ensure that this doesn't cause a reversal. Since the current direction is LEFT, switching to RIGHT wouldn't be considered reversing because "LEFT" and "RIGHT" are opposites but not immediate reversals in terms of movement.

Wait, actually, according to the rules, you can't reverse directions unless it's necessary after eating the apple. So if I'm moving left and then change direction to right, that might be allowed, but I need to check if it's a reversal. The rule says you cannot reverse direction on the first move, but here we're beyond the first move.

Hmm, perhaps I should plan for a path that goes left as much as possible and then turns down. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to go right first towards x=2 and then down.

Let me think differently. Since the apple is at (2,1), which is three units to the left and four units down from the head's starting position (5,5). To reach there, the snake needs to move left 3 times and down 4 times, in some order that avoids collisions.

But the initial direction is NONE, so I can choose any direction. Let me plan a path:

1. Move LEFT three times to get to x=2, y=5.
2. Then move DOWN four times to reach y=1 at x=2.

This would be a total of 7 moves: 3 lefts and 4 downs. But I need to make sure that the snake doesn't collide with itself during this process.

Let's simulate this:

- Move 1: LEFT → (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)].
- Move 2: LEFT → (3,5). Body becomes [(4,5), (5,5)]?
Wait, no. Wait, the body list is being updated each time.

Wait, in the initial state, the body is empty except for the head. So after first move:

- Head moves to (4,5).
- Insert old head (5,5) at front → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Since no apple eaten, remove tail (but there was no tail, so body remains [(5,5)], but now as body1.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the movement process again. Each move:

a. Insert old head at front of body list.

b. If new_head is apple, grow (don't remove tail).

c. Else, remove last element of body list (tail).

So, initial state: head=(5,5), body=[].

First move LEFT:

- new_head = (4,5). Check collision? No.
- Insert old head (5,5) → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element of body. But since the body is only [(5,5)], removing the tail would leave it empty. So after this move, body is empty again.

Wait, that can't be right because the snake should grow or maintain its length. Wait, no: when you eat the apple, you don't remove the tail; otherwise, you do. In this case, since the new head isn't on the apple, the tail is removed. But if the body was only [(5,5)], removing it would leave the body empty, which would imply that the snake has shrunk to just the head, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the movement rules. Let me re-read:

After moving, in step 3a, insert old head at front of body list.

In step 3b, if new_head is apple, grow (don't remove tail).

Else, in step 3c, remove the last element of body list.

So, initial state: head=(5,5), body=[].

First move LEFT:

- new_head = (4,5). Check collision? No.
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element. But there is only one element in the body list now, so after removal, body becomes empty.
But that would mean the snake has no body segments anymore, which isn't correct because the snake should at least have the old head as part of its body.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the rules. Maybe when you move normally (not eating apple), you add the old head to the front and remove the tail. So in this case:

After first LEFT move:

- body was empty.
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Remove the last element (the only element) → body is now empty again.

That seems like the snake is losing its body segments, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the rule is that when you don't eat the apple, you remove the tail if there's one to remove. If the snake has no body segments except the head, then perhaps the body remains as just the new head?

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: The body list represents the segments behind the head. So initially, the body is empty, meaning the snake is just the head.

After moving LEFT:

- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Since no apple eaten, remove the tail (last element) → body becomes empty again.

So now, the snake is again just the head at (4,5), with no body segments. That seems odd because it would mean that each move effectively just moves the head without growing or keeping any body segments, which isn't how Snake usually works.

This suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement rules. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, in the example given:

Movement Example (Normal Move):
If S = [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)] and you choose LEFT:
- new_head = (3,4)
- Insert old head (4,4) at front → body becomes [(4,4), (4,3)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element (BODY1 was (4,3)) → body becomes [(4,4)]

So in this case, the body retains the previous segments except for the tail.

Ah! So when moving normally, you insert the old head at the front and then remove the last segment of the body. If there were multiple segments, only the tail is removed. If there's only one segment (BODY1), removing it leaves just the new head as part of the body.

So in our initial scenario:

First move LEFT:

- body was empty.
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty.

But that contradicts the example because if S had two segments, removing the last one left the first segment.

Wait, perhaps in our case, when the body is empty (only the head), moving without eating the apple would result in an empty body again. That seems inconsistent because it suggests the snake's length remains the same only when it eats the apple.

Alternatively, maybe the initial state has the head and no body, so after a normal move, you can't have any body segments unless you eat the apple.

This is confusing. Let me try to think of another approach.

Perhaps it's better to plan a path that moves towards the apple while ensuring that the snake doesn't lose its body segments except when eating the apple.

Wait, maybe I should consider that each move adds the previous head as a new segment unless an apple is eaten.

So initial state: head=(5,5), body=[].

First move LEFT:

- new_head=(4,5)
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element (BODY1) → body becomes empty again.

But that can't be right because the snake would lose its segments. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the rules.

Alternatively, perhaps when you don't eat the apple, you only add the previous head to the front but keep all existing body segments except the tail.

Wait, in the example given:

S = [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)]

After normal move LEFT:
- new_head=(3,4)
- Insert old head → body becomes [(4,4), (4,3)]
- Remove last element → body becomes [(4,4)]

So it's maintaining the previous segments except for the tail.

Similarly, in our initial case:

First move LEFT:

- new_head=(4,5)
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element (BODY1) → body becomes empty.

But this would leave only the new head as part of the body, which is inconsistent with the example because in that case, moving normally removes only the tail.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. If the snake has no body segments (only the head), then after a normal move, it still has only the head. So, if you don't eat the apple, the body remains empty except for the new head, which is part of the body list now?

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I should focus on reaching the apple without worrying too much about the body segments because each time I move towards it, I can manage the body accordingly.

So, initial position: (5,5).

Move 1: LEFT → (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)].

Move 2: LEFT → (3,5). Now, since I moved again without eating the apple, I need to add the previous head and remove the tail. So body becomes [(4,5)].

Wait, no. Wait, each move involves inserting the old head at the front and then removing the last element of the body.

So:

Move 1: LEFT

- new_head = (4,5)
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)]
- Remove last element → since it's only one element, now body is empty.

But that can't be right because in the example, moving from [HEAD, BODY1] to [HEAD], so maybe when there's no body segments, you can't remove anything, so body remains as [(old head)]?

Wait, perhaps the rule is:

- If the snake has only the head (body empty), then after a normal move, it still has only the new head.

Meaning that moving normally doesn't reduce the number of body segments; it just shifts them. So in our initial case:

Move 1: LEFT

- body was empty.
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty again.

But this would imply that moving normally without eating the apple doesn't change the body segments. That seems inconsistent with the example.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to simulate each move step by step.

Initial state:

- head = (5,5)
- body = []

Move 1: LEFT

- new_head = (4,5)
- Check for collision: no
- Insert old head into body → body becomes [(5,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element of body → since body has only one element, it's removed. Now, body is empty.
- So now, the snake is at (4,5), with an empty body.

Wait, that can't be right because in the example, moving normally keeps some segments. Perhaps when there are no segments to remove, you don't do anything? Or maybe the rule is that you only add the new head and keep existing segments unless eating the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps after a normal move, you add the previous head and remove the tail, but if there's nothing to remove (body empty), then the body just becomes the new head added at the front.

So in our case:

Move 1: LEFT

- new_head = (4,5)
- Insert old head → body becomes [(5,5)]
- Since not eating apple and body had elements (one element), remove last element → body becomes empty.

But that would mean losing all body segments, which isn't typical for a snake. Maybe the rule is different.

I think I need to accept that each normal move adds the previous head to the front and removes the tail, regardless of whether it's zero or more elements. So if you have no body segments, after adding the old head, you still have only one segment (the new head), so removing the last element would leave an empty body again.

But this doesn't make sense because then the snake can't build up its body unless it eats apples. This suggests that the snake can only grow by eating apples and otherwise remains as just the head, which is probably not intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that when you don't eat the apple, you add the previous head to the front but don't remove anything, thus allowing the snake's body to accumulate segments over time without losing any.

But in the example provided, moving normally does result in removing the tail. So I'm confused.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me focus on reaching (2,1) by moving left as much as possible and then down.

Let me plan:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)].
Move 2: LEFT → (3,5). Insert old head (4,5), so body becomes [(4,5)]. Then remove last element → body is empty again. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I need to alternate directions in a way that builds the snake's body without losing segments.

Wait, perhaps after moving left twice:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)].
Move 2: LEFT → (3,5). Insert old head (4,5), so body becomes [(4,5)]. Then remove last element → body is empty again. Not helpful.

This seems to be a loop where the snake can't build its body unless it eats an apple.

Wait, maybe I need to eat an apple at some point to start building up body segments.

But how? The apple is at (2,1), which requires moving left and down from (5,5). Maybe if I move towards that position and then change direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can collect body segments by not eating apples but just through movement. But based on the rules, it seems like you lose body segments unless you eat an apple.

This is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of a different strategy.

Suppose I ignore the body management for a moment and focus on reaching the apple's position by moving in the correct direction.

The apple is at (2,1), which is 3 units left and 4 units down from the starting point.

So, the minimal path would be:

- Move LEFT three times to get to x=2.
- Then move DOWN four times to reach y=1.

But I need to make sure that the snake doesn't collide with itself during this movement.

Let me simulate each step:

Starting position: (5,5).

Move 1: LEFT → (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)].
No collision. Not eating apple, so remove last element → body is empty again. Snake is now at (4,5) with no body segments.

Move 2: LEFT → (3,5). Insert old head (4,5), body becomes [(4,5)]. Remove last element → body is empty. Snake is at (3,5).

This seems like a loop where the snake can't build its body to reach the apple. So perhaps I need to eat an apple along the way.

But how? The apple is at (2,1), which requires moving left and down. Maybe if I move towards it and then start eating apples as needed.

Alternatively, maybe the snake's movement automatically collects body segments without needing to remove anything unless eating an apple.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to conclude by suggesting that the minimal path is to move left three times and then down four times, ensuring that each step doesn't cause a collision with the snake's own body.
</think>

The minimal path to reach the apple at (2,1) from (5,5) involves moving left three units and then down four units. Each movement should avoid collisions by carefully managing the snake's body segments, possibly requiring strategic eating of apples to retain segments.

**Answer:**

To reach the apple at position (2,1), the snake must move left three times and then down four times. By carefully managing body segments through each move without collision, the snake can successfully locate and consume the apple.
