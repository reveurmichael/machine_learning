========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The head starts at (1,2) with direction LEFT. To reach the apple at (2,3), the first safe move is UP to (1,3), avoiding body collisions. Next, moving RIGHT from (1,3) reaches the apple at (2,3) safely. After eating, the snake can move RIGHT next turn, avoiding entrapment."
