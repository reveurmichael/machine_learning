========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 4 LEFT and 6 UP to reach the apple. Starting with LEFT avoids reversing the initial DOWN direction. Moving UP repeatedly shifts the body upward, maintaining safety. After reaching (4,7), moving LEFT aligns with the apple's x-coordinate. Each move checks for collisions (none occur) and ensures the body follows without overlap. After eating the apple, the snake's new body allows legal next moves."
