You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
I'll analyze the current game state to determine the safest path for the snake to reach the apple at (1, 1) from its head position at (7, 1), while following all movement rules and constraints.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Current State:
- Head Position: (7, 1)
- Current Direction: RIGHT
- Body Cells: [(6, 2), (6, 1)]
- Apple Position: (1, 1)

### Analysis:
To move from (7, 1) to (1, 1):
1. We need to move LEFT a total of 6 times (7 - 1 = 6)
2. No vertical movement is needed since both y-coordinates are the same.

Since the snake's current direction is RIGHT and it cannot reverse directly into LEFT, we must plan carefully:

### Movement Planning:
- Start by moving UP or DOWN to avoid immediate reversal.
- Then move LEFT repeatedly until reaching the apple position (1, 1).

Given that both head and body cells are on the same y-coordinate line (y=1), moving UP or DOWN slightly can help avoid a direct reversal:

Let's plan a path:
1. Move UP once
2. Move DOWN once to come back to y=1
3. Move LEFT repeatedly 6 times

This path ensures that we don't immediately reverse direction and safely reach the apple.

### Path Details:
- Moves: ["UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"]

### Reasoning:
The plan is to initially move UP and then DOWN, avoiding a direct reversal of direction. After that, we can safely continue moving LEFT to reach the apple at (1, 1).

Let's return this as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Move UP and then DOWN to avoid direct reversal. Continue moving LEFT until reaching the apple at (1, 1)."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 1) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 2), (6, 1)], to eat the apple at (1, 1).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
