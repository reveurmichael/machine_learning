Okay, I need to plan a path for the snake's head from (3,5) to eat the apple at (6,5). The current direction is "DOWN", and the body cells are given as [(3,6)]. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state. The snake's head is at (3,5), and the body starts with (3,6) because the body list in the input includes all segments from behind the head to the tail. Wait, actually, the problem says that the provided Body cells are ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So the snake's full S is [Head, Body1, Body2,... Tail]. But wait, looking back, the given body cells are [(3,6)], which probably represents the first part of the body. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says: "The provided Body cells list (in the inputs) excludes the head and goes from BODY1 (nearest the head) to BODYN (the tail)." So if the input is [(3,6)], that might mean only one segment after the head? Or perhaps it's just one body cell beyond the head. Let me think.

Wait, the initial state has Body cells ordered as [body segments], which are from behind the head to the tail. But given that the snake's length is probably small because the body list includes (3,6). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key points are:

- Head position: (3,5)
- Current direction: "DOWN"
- Body cells ordered as [(3,6)], which might mean the next segment after the head is (3,6), but perhaps this is part of the body.

But perhaps it's better to think that since the current direction is DOWN, and the snake's head is at (3,5), moving DOWN would take it further down. However, I need to ensure that each move doesn't cause a collision with the body segments or the grid boundaries.

Wait, but let's consider the initial state. The snake's head is at (3,5). The direction is DOWN, so if it moves, the new head position would be (3,6). But wait, no—the movement rule says that each move proceeds by computing the new_head as adding dx and dy based on the current direction. So for "DOWN", dy would be -1 because moving down decreases y.

Wait, perhaps I need to first figure out the initial body configuration. The Body cells list is [(3,6)], which might mean that after the head (3,5), the next segment is (3,6). But wait, if the snake's length is more than one, then perhaps the body has multiple segments.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The snake starts with head at (3,5).
2. The current direction is DOWN, meaning the next cell would be (3,4), but since it's moving DOWN from (3,5), perhaps that's not correct. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the direction determines how the body moves. Since the initial direction is DOWN, and the body list starts with (3,6) as the first body segment after the head? Or perhaps the Body cells include all segments from behind the head to the tail.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that since the current direction is DOWN, moving DOWN would take the head to a new position. But let me check the movement rules again.

The movement steps are:

1. Compute new_head as (head_x + dx[D], head_y + dy[D]).
2. Check if new_head is outside grid: dies.
3. If it's inside but coincides with any BODYi except tail when tail moves, die.
4. Update body positions by inserting old head at front, removing last if collision.

But perhaps for the initial step, since the snake has only a head and one body segment (from the input), maybe we don't need to worry about multiple segments yet.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the initial direction is DOWN, but from the given Body cells list of [(3,6)], it's possible that the snake's body consists of two parts: the head and one body segment beyond it. So when moving DOWN, the new_head would be (3,5) + (0,-1) = (3,4). But wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction determines how the next segment is placed. Since the current direction is DOWN, the snake's body after the head would move in that direction. So if the head is at (3,5), moving DOWN would take it to (3,4). But since the initial direction is given as "DOWN", perhaps we don't need to worry about reversing.

But wait, according to the movement rules, when choosing a new direction, you cannot reverse on the first move. So if current direction is DOWN, next can be RIGHT or LEFT or DOWN? Wait, no: The rule says that after the first move, you cannot reverse direction. So for example, if you were moving DOWN, your next move cannot be UP.

But perhaps this is getting too detailed. Let's try to plan a path from (3,5) to (6,5).

The apple is at (6,5), which is three units to the right of the head. Since each step can cover one unit in x or y direction, but since it's grid-based, perhaps moving right thrice would be the way.

But let's consider that movement may require turning, so perhaps we need to move down then right, but let's check for collisions.

Starting at (3,5), direction DOWN. The initial body is [(3,6)], meaning after the head, there's one segment. So when moving DOWN, from (3,5) to (3,4). But wait, perhaps this is part of the snake's body. Alternatively, maybe the body is just the immediate segments behind the head.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that since the snake has a certain length, let's determine how many body parts there are.

Given that the body cells list is [(3,6)], and considering that each body segment after the head adds one more step. So perhaps the snake has two body segments: head at (3,5), then next at (3,6). But wait, moving DOWN from (3,5) would take it to (3,4), but perhaps this is part of the body.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to outline a possible path:

Start at (3,5), direction DOWN. So new_head would be (3,6). Wait, but if that's outside grid? Wait, no—the grid is 10x10 from (0,0) to (9,9). So (3,6) is valid.

Then, check for collisions: since the body only has the head and one segment beyond. But perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake's length is such that moving DOWN would take it into a cell where another segment is present. Let me think about how to move without colliding.

Since the current direction is DOWN, but we need to reach (6,5), which is three steps to the right. So perhaps the strategy is to move right first, then down as needed.

But let's check for collisions:

Starting at (3,5) with direction DOWN. If we move DOWN, new_head would be (3,4). But wait, perhaps this is part of the body or not. Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN from (3,5) to (3,6), but if that cell is occupied by another segment.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the initial state more carefully. The snake's head is at (3,5), and the body cells are [(3,6)], meaning that the next segment after the head is (3,6). So when moving DOWN from (3,5), we would go to (3,4), but perhaps that's not part of the body yet.

Alternatively, maybe the snake has a certain length. Since the given Body cells list is [(3,6)], perhaps it's just one segment beyond the head. Therefore, the snake has two body parts: from (3,5) to (3,6). But wait, that would make the snake have more than one segment.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial body is only the head and nothing else, but given that there are other cells in the body list, maybe it's better to proceed step by step.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Current position: (3,5), direction DOWN.
2. Need to reach (6,5).
3. The apple is at (6,5).

Since moving DOWN from (3,5) would take us to (3,4), which might be blocked by another segment.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path involves moving right first to avoid immediate collisions.

Let's consider possible moves:

Option 1: Move RIGHT three times. Since each step can move one unit in x direction.

From (3,5):

- MOVE RIGHT → (3,6)
But wait, if that cell is part of the body? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because without knowing the exact initial configuration, it's hard to plan. Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move directly towards the apple as much as possible, given movement rules and collision checks.

Since moving DOWN from (3,5) would take us out of bounds if we go beyond y=9? Wait, no—wait, grid is 10x10, so y can be up to 9. So moving down from (3,5) could lead to (3,4), which is valid.

But perhaps the initial move should be DOWN to avoid immediate collisions with the body.

Alternatively, perhaps let's outline a possible path:

- Start at (3,5)
- Move DOWN to (3,6). Check if this is allowed. Since it's not part of the body yet, no collision.
- Now position is (3,6), direction still DOWN? Or turn right?

Wait, but movement rules say that when choosing a new direction, you can't reverse on the first move.

So perhaps from moving DOWN, next moves cannot be UP.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of the minimal steps needed: from (3,5) to (6,5). That requires moving three units to the right in x-direction.

Each step can move one unit in any direction, but given movement constraints and collision checks.

So possible moves:

- Move RIGHT multiple times without stepping into other segments.

But perhaps it's better to consider that each body segment must be checked for collisions when moving.

Given that the initial body cells are [(3,6)], perhaps after moving DOWN from (3,5) to (3,4), but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to move RIGHT first.

Let me try step-by-step:

1. Current position: (3,5)
2. Direction: DOWN
3. Move DOWN → new_head = (3,5-1)= (3,4). Check if this cell is part of any body segment. Since initial Body cells are [(3,6)], perhaps moving to (3,4) is safe.
4. Now position is (3,4), direction is DOWN? Or do we need to change direction.

Wait, perhaps when moving, the new_head is computed as adding dx and dy based on current direction. Then, if this new_head is valid and not in a body segment, proceed; else, choose another direction.

But perhaps it's better to outline all possible moves:

From (3,5), direction DOWN would take us to (3,4). Let's check for collisions.

If moving DOWN from (3,5) leads to (3,4), which is valid. Then we can proceed.

Now, the next move could be RIGHT to increase x by 1.

But perhaps let's outline a possible path:

- Move DOWN → new_head = (3,6). Wait no—wait, moving DOWN from (3,5) decreases y by 1: so y=4. So position becomes (3,4).

Now, the body has more segments?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move RIGHT first.

But maybe this is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should consider that since the apple is at (6,5), which is three units right of the head, and each step can cover one unit in x direction without any collision if moving directly.

Therefore, possible moves:

- Move RIGHT three times: but wait, movement rules may require choosing directions carefully to avoid collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps move DOWN first, then adjust.

But perhaps it's better to consider that since the initial direction is DOWN and we need to reach (6,5), which is further in x-direction, perhaps moving right would be necessary.

Thus, let's outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT → (4,5)
2. Move RIGHT → (5,5)
3. Move RIGHT → (6,5)

But wait, each move must be checked for collisions with the body segments.

Given that initial Body cells are [(3,6)], perhaps moving to (4,5) is allowed because it's not part of the body yet.

Thus, the moves would be:

- MOVE RIGHT from (3,5) → (4,5)
- Then check if any body segments overlap. Since current position is (4,5), and initial Body cells are [(3,6)], perhaps moving right again without collision.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to outline the steps:

Starting at (3,5):

1. Move RIGHT → (4,5)
2. Check if this cell is in any body segment. If not, proceed.
3. Then move RIGHT → (5,5)
4. Again check for collision.
5. Finally, move RIGHT → (6,5)

But perhaps the issue is that when moving from (3,5) to (4,5), we need to ensure that this new position doesn't coincide with any body segments beyond.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model each possible step and check for collisions.

Given the complexity of tracking all possible positions and directions, perhaps it's better to outline the solution based on movement rules.

Since the initial direction is DOWN, but moving DOWN from (3,5) could lead us to (3,4), which may not be part of any body segments. Thus, let's proceed with that move.

So step-by-step:

1. Initial position: (3,5)
2. Direction: DOWN
   a. Compute new_head as (3 + 0, 5 -1) = (3,4)
   b. Check if new_head is within grid: yes.
   c. Check against body segments. Since initial Body cells are [(3,6)], perhaps moving to (3,4) doesn't interfere with any body segment beyond the head.
   d. Proceed, so now position is (3,4), direction remains DOWN.

But wait, maybe after this move, we need to check if moving further down causes a collision. For example, moving from (3,4) down would take us to (3,3), which may not be part of the body yet, but perhaps it's better to move right first.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to move RIGHT first.

But perhaps I'm making this more complicated than necessary. Let's try to outline a possible path:

- Start at (3,5)
- Move RIGHT → (4,5) [move 1]
   - Check if this new position is allowed: since current direction was DOWN, but moving right might require changing the direction.
   Wait, perhaps when choosing to move RIGHT after DOWN, we need to change our direction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each move should be in any possible valid direction (including LEFT, UP, DOWN), except reversing on first move.

But perhaps this is getting too involved. Let me try to think of the minimal path: moving three steps right from x=3 to x=6 at y=5. Each step can increase x by 1 without collision as long as no body segments are in between.

Thus, possible moves:

- MOVE RIGHT → (4,5)
- MOVE RIGHT → (5,5)
- MOVE RIGHT → (6,5)

Now, check for collisions during these steps.

Assuming that each move is to a new x position beyond the current body segment, perhaps this path is valid.

Therefore, the sequence of moves would be:

1. MOVE RIGHT
2. MOVE RIGHT
3. MOVE RIGHT

But wait, let's verify if moving right from (3,5) without changing direction causes any problem.

At each step:

- From (3,5), move RIGHT → (4,5). Check if this is allowed.
   - The new_head would be (4,5).
   - Since the initial body only has (3,6), perhaps moving to (4,5) doesn't interfere with any segments beyond the head.

Thus, proceed.

Then from (4,5):

- MOVE RIGHT → (5,5)
   - Check for collision.
     - The new_head is (5,5). Since initial body has [(3,6)], which is at y=6, perhaps moving down to (5,5) doesn't interfere.

Finally, from (5,5):

- MOVE RIGHT → (6,5)
   - Check:
     - New_head is (6,5).
     - Assuming no body segments in between, this should be allowed.

Thus, the sequence of moves would be:

1. MOVE RIGHT
2. MOVE RIGHT
3. MOVE RIGHT

But perhaps that's not correct because movement after changing direction may require adjusting.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN first is better to avoid immediate collision with the initial body segment at y=6.

Let me try another approach:

1. From (3,5), move DOWN → but wait, from (3,5) down would go beyond grid? Wait no: since grid goes up to y=9.

Wait, perhaps moving DOWN is possible as long as it's within the grid.

But maybe this is getting too tangled without knowing the exact initial body configuration. Perhaps a better approach is to outline that since the apple is at (6,5), and current position is (3,5), we can move right three times: each MOVE RIGHT from x=3 to x=4, 5, then 6.

Thus, perhaps the moves are:

- MOVE RIGHT → (4,5)
- MOVE RIGHT → (5,5)
- MOVE RIGHT → (6,5)

But wait, what about the initial direction? If we start moving right first, perhaps that's acceptable as long as no movement would cause a collision with body segments.

Thus, given all this, I think the solution is to move right three times: from x=3 to 4, then 5, then 6. Thus, each MOVE RIGHT step.

Therefore, the sequence of moves would be:

1. MOVE RIGHT
2. MOVE RIGHT
3. MOVE RIGHT

But perhaps in code terms, it's more about choosing directions correctly without reversing.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is to move right three times.
</think>

The solution involves moving from (3,5) towards (6,5) by moving right three steps. Each step increases x by 1 while keeping y constant at 5.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Start Position:** (3,5)
2. **Direction:** DOWN
   - Compute new_head as (3 + 0, 5 - 1) = (3,4). Check if within grid and not in body segments.
   - Proceed to (3,4).
3. **Next Move: RIGHT**
   - From (3,4), move right to (4,4).
   - Repeat this for x=5 and then x=6.

However, considering the need to reach (6,5) efficiently:

- Each MOVE RIGHT step increases x by 1 without causing collision as long as no body segments interfere.
- Thus, three MOVE RIGHT steps from (3,5) to (4,5), (5,5), and finally (6,5).

**Answer:**

The correct sequence of moves is to move right thrice:

1. MOVE RIGHT
2. MOVE RIGHT
3. MOVE RIGHT

Final position after these moves: (6,5).
