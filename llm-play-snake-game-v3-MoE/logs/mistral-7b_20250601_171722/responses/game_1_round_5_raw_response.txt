 {
    "moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
    "reasoning": "The snake is currently at (9,5), and the apple is located at (7,1). To avoid collisions, we prioritize moving towards the apple. Since the current direction is 'RIGHT', we cannot reverse directions immediately. Instead, we move 'DOWN' to (8,4) to give space for the body segment to grow when eating the apple. Next, we move 'LEFT' twice to approach the apple, ensuring there will be at least one legal move after eating it."
