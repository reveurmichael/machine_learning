<think>
Alright, let's tackle this Snake problem. The snake is at (7,0), and the apple is at (4,1). I need to find a path that avoids collisions with the body segments or walls while respecting movement rules.

First, I'll consider the initial position. The head is at (7,0) facing RIGHT because the current direction is "RIGHT." So moving RIGHT would take it to (8,0), but looking ahead, I see that might not be the best path since it's far from the apple and could lead into body segments.

Wait, the body cells provided are [(6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]. So the snake is in a vertical line at x=5 to x=6, y=0 to y=3. The head is at (7,0), so it's next to the body segment at (6,0). Moving RIGHT would take it away from the apple and might not be efficient.

Since the first move can't reverse direction, I need to decide whether to continue moving RIGHT or turn UP. Moving UP seems better because it starts bringing the snake closer to the apple. Let me check if that's allowed. The current direction is "RIGHT," so turning UP would mean changing direction from "RIGHT" to "UP," which isn't a reverse since they are perpendicular.

Moving UP would take the head to (7,1). From there, I can continue moving UP or LEFT. Wait, no—after the first move, the direction is now "UP." So the next move can't be DOWN unless it's the same as before.

Wait, no, the movement rules say that after a direction is chosen, you can't reverse on the next move. So if I move UP, then from (7,1), I can't immediately turn DOWN. But for now, let's see what path would be optimal.

Another consideration: after each move, the body segments shift. Since we're starting with multiple body segments, moving in a way that avoids collision is crucial. For example, if I move UP too quickly, I might collide with my own body.

Let me map out possible paths:

Option 1:
- Move RIGHT to (8,0). From there, can't immediately reverse, so next move must be RIGHT again or UP. Moving RIGHT again would take it to (9,0), which is the top-right corner. That might trap the snake since it's near the edge and can't easily turn back.

Option 2:
- Move UP to (7,1). From here, moving LEFT could bring me closer to the apple at (4,1). Let's see: from (7,1), moving LEFT would take me to (6,1). Then, I need to check if that's a body segment or not. The current body is [(6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)], so (6,1) isn't occupied yet.

Wait, but after moving UP to (7,1), the next move can't be DOWN because it's the opposite direction. So from (7,1), options are LEFT or RIGHT again. Moving LEFT seems better as it brings me closer horizontally to the apple at x=4.

So, moving from (7,1) to (6,1). Now, I'm at (6,1). From here, can I move UP? That would take me to (6,2). But the apple is at (4,1), so I need to get closer horizontally. Maybe moving LEFT again.

But wait, after moving LEFT from (7,1) to (6,1), the next direction can't be RIGHT because it's a reversal. So options are LEFT or UP or DOWN. Moving LEFT would take me to (5,1). Now, I'm at (5,1). From here, I need to get to (4,1). So moving LEFT again would take me there.

But let me think about the body segments. The current body after each move:

After first move UP: head is (7,1), body is [(6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)].
Then moving LEFT to (6,1): body becomes [(7,1), (6,0), ..., (5,3)] and we remove the tail if not eating apple.

Wait, no—if I don't eat the apple, I remove the tail. So after each move except when eating, the body length remains the same.

But let's clarify:

- When moving normally (not eating apple), the tail moves forward by removing the last segment.
- When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows.

So in Option 2:

1. Move UP to (7,1). Body becomes [(6,0), (5,0), ..., (5,3)], and head is now at (7,1).
2. Next, can't reverse, so move LEFT to (6,1). Body becomes [(7,1), (6,0), ..., (5,3)].
   - Check if (6,1) is blocked by body? No, because the body segments are at lower y's and x=5-6.
3. Then, can't reverse again—options from (6,1): LEFT to (5,1), UP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0).
   - Moving LEFT to (5,1) brings me closer to the apple (x=4, y=1). From there, moving LEFT again would take me to (4,1), the apple.

But wait, after each move, we need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

So, let's simulate:

Move 1: UP to (7,1). Check if (7,1) is blocked? Body segments are at y=0 and y=1 for x=5-6. So (7,1) is unblocked.
Body after move: [(7,1), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]. But wait, the body list in the input was [(6,0), (5,0), ..., (5,3)], so after moving UP, we insert the old head (7,0) at front? Or is it the new head?

Wait, no. When you move, the process is:

- Compute new_head.
- Check collision with any body cells except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

So when moving, after computing new_head, check if it collides with any body segments (excluding the tail's position before moving).

Wait, let me clarify step 2: If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies.

So, for each move:

- Compute new_head.
- Check if new_head is outside grid → die.
- Check if new_head is in body list (BODY1 to BODYN) → die.
   - Except, if new_head is the tail's current cell (which will be moving this turn), it's allowed.

Wait, no: The rule says "any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn." So if the new_head coincides with the tail's current cell (before moving), it's allowed because the tail is about to move forward.

In our case, after the first move UP to (7,1), the body is [(6,0), (5,0), ..., (5,3)]. The new head is at (7,1). Is that in the body? No, so it's safe.

Next, from (7,1), moving LEFT to (6,1):

- Check if (6,1) is outside grid → no.
- Check if (6,1) is in body: body segments are [(6,0), ..., (5,3)]. So (6,1) is not in the body. Safe.

Then, from (6,1), moving LEFT to (5,1):

- Check (5,1): not in body → safe.
From there, moving LEFT again to (4,1)—the apple.

So that's a possible path:

UP, LEFT, LEFT.

But I need to ensure after each move that the snake doesn't collide with its own body.

Also, another consideration: when the head moves into the apple, it grows. So if I can reach (4,1), I'll eat the apple, which means the next move will have a longer body and cannot lose segments.

But wait, in the initial state, after moving UP, then LEFT twice, I'm at (4,1). Is that possible?

Let me map it:

Start: HEAD=(7,0), direction=RIGHT, body=[(6,0), (5,0), ..., (5,3)].

Move 1: UP → new_head=(7,1). Check collision: no. Body becomes [(7,1), (6,0), ..., (5,3)]. Tail moves normally, so remove the last segment—wait, but after moving, when you don't eat apple, you remove the tail. So body length remains same.

Wait, no: When moving to a new_head that is not the apple, you insert old head at front and remove the tail. So in this case:

After first move UP:
- new_head=(7,1)
- Check collision: safe
- Insert (7,0) at front of body → body becomes [(7,0), (6,0), ..., (5,3)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last segment (5,3). So body is now [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)].

Wait, that's a problem. Because after moving UP, the tail moves forward, so it's removing (5,3), which was part of the original body. But in reality, the body should shift: each segment moves forward, and the head moves to new_head, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the body list is updated by inserting the old head at front and appending the new_head, then truncating if not eating apple.

Wait, no—the process is:

When you move normally (not eating apple):

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check collision with any body segments except possibly the last one (tail).
3. If safe:
   a. Insert old head at front of body list.
   b. Append new_head to body list.
   c. Remove the last element.

Wait, no—actually, I think the correct process is:

- The body moves forward by shifting each segment to the next position, except for the tail which is removed unless it's eating an apple.

But perhaps a better way is to model it as follows:

Each move, except when eating apple, the head moves to new_head, and each body segment shifts forward (the first segment becomes second, etc.), and the tail is removed.

So in code terms:

body = [segments]
new_body = [new_head] + body[:-1]

But that's if we're moving normally. If we eat apple, then body remains same length but adds new_head to front without removing last element.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think step by step.

Original body: [(6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]

After move UP:

new_head = (7,1)

Check collision with body? No.

Then, create new_body:

Insert old head at front → [ (7,0) ] + original body except last segment?

Wait, no. When moving normally, you add the previous head to front and remove the tail.

So after first move UP:

new_head = (7,1)

check collision: safe

body becomes [(7,0)] + original_body[:-1] → [ (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) ]

Wait, but the original body was 5 segments. After moving UP, it's 5 segments as well because we removed one from the end.

Yes:

body = [new_head] + body[:-1]

Wait, no: new_head is inserted at front, and the rest of the body shifts, with last segment removed.

So:

new_body = [old_head] + body[0:-1]

In this case:

old_head was (7,0)

body[0:-1] = [(6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)]

so new_body becomes [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)]

Similarly, for each subsequent move.

So in the second move, from (7,1):

new_head = (6,1)

check collision: no

body becomes [ (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) ][:-1] → wait, no. After moving, new_body is [old_head (now at (7,1))] + body[:-1]

Wait, I'm confusing myself.

Let me clarify:

Each move after the first involves checking if the new_head collides with any body segments except possibly the tail's current position.

Then, when creating new_body:

- If not eating apple: insert old head (current head before move) at front, and remove last segment of original body.
   So new_body = [old_head] + body[0:-1]

But wait, the 'body' in each step is the updated body from previous moves.

So after first move UP:

new_head = (7,1)

check collision: safe

body becomes [old_head (7,0)] + original_body[:-1] → [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)]

But in the next move from (7,1):

old_head is (7,1)

new_head = (6,1)

check collision: safe

body becomes [ (7,1) ] + body[0:-1] → which would be [(7,1)] + [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)]

Then remove the last segment (5,2).

So new_body = [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1)]

Wait, no—if body was [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2)], then [:-1] is up to (5,1). So new_body would be [old_head (7,1)] + [ (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1) ]

Yes.

So after each move, the body shifts with the old head added at front and tail removed.

Thus, in this path:

Move 1: UP to (7,1). Body becomes [(7,0), (6,0), ..., (5,2)]

Move 2: LEFT to (6,1). Body becomes [(7,1), (7,0), ..., (5,1)]

Move 3: LEFT to (5,1). Check collision? Is (5,1) in body? Yes, because original body had (5,1).

Wait, no—if we're at move 2:

body = [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1)]

So when moving LEFT to (5,1):

new_head=(5,1). Check if it's in body: yes, because [5,1] is the last segment.

But according to the rule, can't collide with any BODYi except the tail's current cell. So if new_head is the tail's current cell before moving, it's allowed.

Wait, the 'tail' is the last segment of the current body. Before move 3:

current_body = [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1)]

So the tail is at (5,1). The new_head is also at (5,1).

Thus, it's allowed because new_head coincides with the tail's current cell.

Therefore, moving to (5,1) is allowed. Now, from there, moving LEFT again would take us to (4,1), which is the apple.

So move 4: LEFT to (4,1). Check collision:

new_head=(4,1)

Check if in body? Body before this move is [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1)]. So no. Also, since new_head isn't the tail's cell before moving (tail is at (5,1)), it's safe.

Thus, eating apple here:

new_body becomes [old_head (5,1)] + body[0:-1] → [ (5,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0) ]

And then, since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail.

So in this path:

UP, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT.

Wait, no: from (5,1), moving LEFT to (4,1). That's move 3. Then after that, can I make another LEFT? Wait, after eating apple, direction remains the same unless changed.

But after eating, you don't lose a segment, so next moves can be in any direction except reversal of previous.

Wait, no: movement rules say that you can't reverse on the next move if you moved previously. So if last move was LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT unless it's same as before.

But after eating apple, your body is longer, but direction remains until changed.

I think I might have gotten confused with the movement rules. Let me restate:

You can choose a new direction each time, except that you cannot immediately reverse direction. So if your last move was LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT (since that's reversing), unless it's in the same direction as before.

Wait no: the rule is "you cannot reverse on the next move." So reversing means going from RIGHT to LEFT or vice versa.

But actually, "reverse" isn't defined; perhaps it means changing direction 180 degrees. For example, if you're moving UP and then turn DOWN (opposite), that's a reversal. Similarly, RIGHT to LEFT is reversal.

Therefore, after each move, your next move can't be the opposite of the last direction.

So in our path:

Move 1: UP → direction is now "UP"
Move 2: LEFT → can't go UP again unless it's same as previous? Wait no—if last move was UP, next move can't be DOWN (reverse), but moving LEFT or RIGHT is allowed.

Wait, no—reversal refers to changing from a particular direction. For example:

- If you're facing UP and then turn DOWN, that's a reversal.
- Similarly, if you're facing RIGHT and turn LEFT, that's a reversal.

So in our case:

Move 1: Direction becomes "UP" after moving UP.
Move 2: Can't reverse, so can move UP again or change direction to LEFT or RIGHT? Wait, no—if last move was UP, next move can't be DOWN (reverse). So you can continue moving UP, but perhaps it's more optimal to turn.

Wait, I think the rule is that on each move after the first, you can choose any direction except the one you came from unless it's same as before.

But actually, according to typical movement rules in such puzzles:

- You cannot reverse direction. So if your last move was UP, next move can't be DOWN. Similarly for RIGHT and LEFT.

Thus, in our case:

Move 1: Direction is "UP"
Move 2: Can choose LEFT or RIGHT or continue UP (but usually, you can only face forward; perhaps after moving UP, you must keep facing forward unless you turn).

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should focus on the path.

In any case, the minimal number of moves would be to go straight left as much as possible.

But in our current path:

UP, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT

That's 4 moves.

Alternatively, if we could move directly left without up, that would be 3 moves. But perhaps due to starting position and body configuration, it might not be possible.

Wait, initial position: (0,0) assuming origin.

Body segments at start: [(6,0), (5,0), (4,0), ..., (1,0)]? No—original body is given as [(6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0)] perhaps? Wait no—the original problem says "body" is [ (x,y) ].

Wait, the user hasn't provided a specific starting position. So maybe it's better to assume that the snake starts at some initial position and needs to reach a food item or something.

But without more details, I think the answer would be based on the number of segments and movements needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about moving in such a way that each segment follows the head, so after several moves, the tail repositions.

But honestly, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to count the number of moves required.

Given that, I think 4 moves: UP, LEFT thrice.

But I'm not sure if there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe going DOWN then LEFT thrice is also an option.

Wait, but initial position isn't given, so hard to say.

In any case, the minimal number of moves would be based on how the snake can navigate its body.

Assuming starting at (0,0) with segments extending right:

Move 1: UP to (0,1)

Then move LEFT thrice to ( -3, 1 )

So total moves: 4

Alternatively, if you can go around without reversing direction, maybe fewer.

But I think 4 is the minimal.

Thus, after thinking through it, I believe the minimal number of moves required is 4.
</think>

The minimal number of moves needed for the snake to reach its tail requires careful navigation. By moving UP and then LEFT three times, the snake effectively repositions itself without reversing direction unnecessarily. Thus, the shortest path involves four moves.

**Answer:** \boxed{4}
