{
"moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (1,9) with direction LEFT. To reach the apple at (8,3), it needs 7 RIGHT and 6 DOWN moves. First, move DOWN to (1,8) (since UP is invalid). Then move RIGHT 7 times to (8,8), avoiding the top-body obstruction. Finally, move DOWN 5 times to (8,3) (apple). Each move is safe as the head doesn't collide with walls or body segments, and after eating the apple, there's space to move further down."
