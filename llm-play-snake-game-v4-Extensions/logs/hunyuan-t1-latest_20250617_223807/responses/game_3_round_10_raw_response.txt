{
"moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (2,9) with direction LEFT. To reach the apple at (9,7), the snake needs to move 7 RIGHT and 2 DOWN. First, moving DOWN avoids the upward wall collision. Then, moving RIGHT repeatedly navigates along the lower y-level, avoiding the snake's body. A final DOWN positions the head at (8,7), followed by a RIGHT to the apple at (9,7). All moves avoid collisions with walls and body segments, and after eating the apple, there are safe subsequent moves."
