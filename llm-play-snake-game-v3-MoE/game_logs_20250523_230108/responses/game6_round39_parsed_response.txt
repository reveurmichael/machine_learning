{"moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"], "reasoning": "The main objective is to guide the snake from (6, 6) to (2, 5). The correct approach involves moving DOWN first to decrease y-coordinate before adjusting x. First move DOWN once from (6, 6) to (6, 5), then move LEFT four times to reach x=3. From there, continue moving LEFT until reaching the apple at (2, 5). In summary: First move DOWN, then move LEFT repeatedly."}
