## Question

In the file replay_engine.py, we have the following code:
```python
class ReplayEngine(BaseReplayEngine, GameController)  
```

My question is: can we have multiple inheritance in Python?


## Answer


Yes — Python fully supports multiple inheritance, and the line

```python
class ReplayEngine(BaseReplayEngine, GameController):
    ...
```

is perfectly legal.

Key points to keep in mind when doing this:

1. Method-resolution order (MRO)  
   • Python uses C3 linearisation to decide which parent’s implementation is chosen when the same attribute appears in several bases.  
   • The order in the class header matters: here `ReplayEngine` will look in `BaseReplayEngine` first, then in `GameController`, then in their common ancestor (`BaseGameController`), and finally in `object`.

2. Co-operative `super()`  
   • Inside `__init__` (or any method you expect all bases to participate in) call `super().__init__(…)` instead of naming a parent explicitly.  
   • All parent classes in the diamond must also use `super()` so the single call walks the whole MRO once without double-initialising anyone.

   ```python
   class BaseReplayEngine(BaseGameController):
       def __init__(self, *a, **kw):
           super().__init__(*a, **kw)   # calls BaseGameController.__init__

   class GameController(BaseGameController):
       def __init__(self, *a, **kw):
           super().__init__(*a, **kw)

   class ReplayEngine(BaseReplayEngine, GameController):
       def __init__(self, *a, **kw):
           super().__init__(*a, **kw)   # visits BaseReplayEngine → GameController → BaseGameController
   ```

3. Avoiding attribute clashes  
   • Both bases inherit from `BaseGameController`, so they share the same fields (snake positions, score, etc.). With the cooperative-super pattern they’re initialised only once, preventing conflicts.

4. When to rethink  
   • If the two parent classes have **unrelated** responsibilities and share no ancestor, multiple inheritance can become messy. In that case favour composition or a mix-in style.  
   • In our codebase both parents ultimately extend the same controller scaffold, so multiple inheritance is the most economical way to graft “replay features” onto the regular game controller behaviour.

So the current design is valid and safe as long as each class in the chain uses cooperative `super()` and we respect the MRO mechanics.
