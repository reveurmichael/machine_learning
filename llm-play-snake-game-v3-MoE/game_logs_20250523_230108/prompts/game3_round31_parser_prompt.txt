Okay, so I need to help plan a safe path for the snake's head from (5,4) towards the apple at (7,4). Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the given information. The snake's body cells are provided as [(6,4), (6,5)]. Wait, but looking back, the input says "Body cells: [(6,4), (6,5)]". But wait, the head is at (5,4). So perhaps this list includes segments from behind the head to the tail. Let me think.

The snake's full body is [Head, Body1, Body2, ..., Tail]. The given body cells are in order from behind the head to the tail. Since the head is at (5,4), and the body cells start with (6,4) as Body1. That would mean the direction is such that each subsequent segment is adjacent.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The snake's full S is [Head, Body1, Body2, ..., Tail]. Each Bodyi is adjacent to its predecessor. So if the body cells given are [(6,4), (6,5)], then perhaps these are consecutive segments in the body.

But wait, the head is at (5,4). Let's see: The snake's full S would be [Head, Body1, ..., Tail]. If the body cells list starts with (6,4) as Body1, that might mean that from the head at (5,4), the next segment is (6,4). But wait, that can't be because each Bodyi should be adjacent to its predecessor.

Wait no, perhaps the given body cells are in order from behind the head. So if the head is at (5,4), and the first body cell is (6,4), which could mean that moving forward from the head, the next segment is (6,4). But wait, this might not be correct because each body segment should be adjacent to the previous.

Let me try to reconstruct the snake's body. The given body cells are [(6,4), (6,5)]. So perhaps these are consecutive segments in the body, meaning that from the head at (5,4), moving forward, the next segment is (6,4). But wait, that would imply that (6,4) is behind the head. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the given body cells list represents segments from the one before the head to the tail. Since the snake's full S starts with the head, followed by Body1, Body2, etc. So if the given body cells are [(6,4), (6,5)], that might mean that the first segment after the head is (6,4), and the next is (6,5). But wait, maybe this list includes all segments from behind the head to the tail.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the snake as starting with the head at (5,4). The body cells given are [(6,4), (6,5)], which suggests that after the head, the first body segment is (6,4), and then (6,5). But this might not make sense because each Bodyi should be adjacent to its predecessor.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake's body includes all segments from behind the head to the tail. So if the head is at (5,4), and the next segment is (6,4), which could mean that moving right from the head. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me try another approach. The problem states that the snake's full S is [Head, Body1, Body2, ..., Tail]. Each Bodyi is adjacent to its predecessor. Given the body cells list [(6,4), (6,5)], perhaps these are consecutive segments in the body from behind the head to the tail.

But wait, if the head is at (5,4), and the first body cell is (6,4), that would mean that moving right from the head. But then the next body cell is (6,5), which would be above it. So perhaps this indicates that after the head, the body segments are arranged in such a way.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the movement rules and what needs to happen.

The snake starts at (5,4). The apple is at (7,4). So the snake needs to move from (5,4) towards (7,4), which is 2 units to the right.

But wait, the head is moving first. Each turn, the snake moves in a direction, and then checks for collisions. Also, when eating the apple, the tail doesn't move that step.

Given that, let's plan the path.

First, the snake is at (5,4). The body cells given are [(6,4), (6,5)]. Wait, perhaps this means that from the head at (5,4), the next segment is (6,4), then (6,5). But perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake's full S is [Head, Body1, Body2], where Body1 and Body2 are consecutive segments. Given that the body cells list has two elements: [(6,4), (6,5)]. So perhaps after the head at (5,4), the first segment is (6,4), then (6,5). But this might not make sense because each Bodyi should be adjacent to its predecessor.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the snake's body structure. Since the full S is [Head, Body1, Body2, ..., Tail], and each Bodyi is adjacent to its predecessor. The given body cells list includes all segments from behind the head (Body1) to the tail. So if the given list has [(6,4), (6,5)], perhaps these are consecutive in the snake's body.

But I think maybe this information isn't crucial for planning because the problem gives specific directions and initial positions. Let me focus on what needs to be done.

The head is at (5,4). The apple is at (7,4). So the snake needs to move right twice.

However, there are obstacles: the body segments are [(6,4), (6,5)]. Wait, perhaps these are in front of the head. Let me see:

If the head is at (5,4), and the first body segment is (6,4), that might mean that the snake's body extends from (5,4) to (6,4). Then, perhaps the next segment is (6,5), meaning moving up from (6,4).

But wait, perhaps the given body cells are [(6,4), (6,5)], which would imply that after the head at (5,4), the first body segment is (6,4), then (6,5). So this might mean that the snake's body starts with (6,4) as Body1.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed step by step.

The snake's current direction is "LEFT". The head is at (5,4). If moving left from (5,4), it would go to (4,4). But let's see what the movement rules say.

Each move proceeds as:

1. Compute new_head = (head_x + dx[D], head_y + dy[D]).
2. Check for collisions:
   a. New_head outside grid → die.
   b. If moving into a body cell except Tail when it will move → die.
3. Update body positions: insert old head at front, remove tail if needed.

Given that the direction is "LEFT", which would mean moving from (5,4) to (4,4). But perhaps let's consider the initial state.

The snake's full S is [Head, Body1, Body2]. The given body cells are [(6,4), (6,5)]. Wait, perhaps this indicates that after the head at (5,4), the first segment is (6,4), then (6,5). So perhaps the body has segments starting from behind the head.

But maybe I'm getting stuck. Let's try to plan the path.

The snake starts at (5,4). The apple is at (7,4). The snake needs to move right twice. But there are obstacles: body cells at (6,4) and (6,5).

Wait, perhaps the body segments after the head would block certain paths. Let's think about possible moves.

Since the direction is "LEFT", but according to rule 1, if it's the first move, cannot reverse direction on the first move. Wait, no: rule 1 says that for any move, including the first one, you can't reverse direction if current direction is given. Wait, perhaps I need to read rule 1 carefully.

Rule 1: Valid directions are "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed. Also, for the first move, cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT; same with UP and DOWN.

But in this case, perhaps the snake's initial direction is "LEFT" because that's given as an input.

Wait, looking back: The problem says "You are given the following inputs: • Head position: (5,4) — (x,y) of the snake's head. Current direction: 'LEFT'".

So current direction is LEFT. Therefore, for the first move, can't reverse direction if it were already opposite? Wait, perhaps rule 1 says that you cannot reverse direction on the first move. So if your current direction is LEFT, and it's your first move, then next move cannot be RIGHT.

But perhaps this is complicating. Let's try to plan a path from (5,4) towards (7,4).

Possible moves: since the apple is at (7,4), which is two cells to the right of the head. So moving right twice would get us there. But we need to check for collisions.

But let's think about possible paths:

Option 1: Move right, then right again.

But perhaps before that, we might hit a body segment.

If from (5,4), moving LEFT is not useful because it would take us back towards the head or into an obstacle. So perhaps initial direction should be RIGHT.

Wait, but current direction is LEFT. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the given body cells are [(6,4), (6,5)], which might mean that after the head at (5,4), there's a segment at (6,4) and then (6,5). Therefore, perhaps the snake has two segments: one behind the head, starting at (6,4).

So when moving from (5,4), perhaps we can move right to (6,4), which is part of the body.

But given that the direction is LEFT, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's better to proceed by considering possible moves.

Since the problem gives specific information about the initial position and direction, let's try to model the snake's movement step by step.

Given:

- Head at (5,4)
- Current direction: LEFT
- Body segments: [(6,4), (6,5)]

So perhaps the body starts with a segment behind the head. So from the head at (5,4), moving left would take us to (4,4). But perhaps that's part of the snake's body.

But given that the direction is LEFT, let's proceed:

First move: according to rule 1, if it's the first move and current direction is LEFT, can we reverse? Or perhaps since it's not specified as the first move yet, maybe we proceed with LEFT.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to model possible paths.

We need to reach (7,4) from (5,4). So two steps to the right.

But let's see if that is possible without hitting any obstacles.

If current direction is LEFT, but according to rule 1, if it's the first move and you reverse direction, perhaps we can change direction. But since this is not specified as our first move, perhaps proceed with LEFT for now.

So moving from (5,4) left would take us out of the grid? Wait no: (5-1=4, y remains 4). Wait, if head is at (5,4), and we move LEFT, then new_head would be (4,4).

But perhaps this is a valid move as long as it doesn't hit any body segments.

Wait, but let's see what the body looks like. The snake's full S starts with [Head, Body1, Body2]. The given body cells are [(6,4), (6,5)]. So perhaps after the head at (5,4), the first segment is (6,4) as Body1.

Therefore, when moving from the head, perhaps the direction is to move right, not left. Because if you're facing LEFT and your next position would be outside the grid or into a body segment, you might need to change direction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that since current direction is LEFT, but to reach (7,4), we need to move RIGHT twice.

So let's try moving right from (5,4) to (6,4). But if the first segment after head is at (6,4), then this might be part of the body. So perhaps that would block movement in certain directions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should proceed with a possible path.

Let's consider moving right twice:

First move: from (5,4) to (6,4). Now, check if (6,4) is blocked by any body segments. If the body has [(6,4), (6,5)], then perhaps when you step into (6,4), which is a body segment except for Tail, that would cause a collision.

Wait, according to rule 2: if moving into a body cell except Tail during this move, it's a collision. So in the first move, after moving from head at (5,4) to (6,4), we land on (6,4). If this is part of the body segments, then perhaps that's allowed unless it's the tail.

Wait, but the given body cells are [(6,4), (6,5)], which suggests that after the head, there's a segment at (6,4) as Body1. Therefore, moving from (5,4) to (6,4) would land on Body1, except for the tail.

Therefore, perhaps this move is allowed only if it doesn't hit any body segments except Tail.

But since the next step after this might be towards the apple, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach.

Since we need to reach (7,4), let's plan two moves to the right from (5,4).

First move: moving RIGHT from (5,4) → (6,4). Then check if this is allowed.

If this position is not blocked by any body segments except Tail. But perhaps in this case, since (6,4) is part of the body, moving into it would cause a collision unless it's only for when it will move again.

This might be getting too complicated. Perhaps I should look for another way.

Since the given body cells are [(6,4), (6,5)], perhaps these represent consecutive segments in the snake's body from behind to the tail. Therefore, if the head is at (5,4), then Body1 would be at (6,4) and Body2 at (6,5). Thus, when moving from the head towards the right, we can move into Body1.

Therefore, perhaps this movement isn't allowed because it's hitting a body segment except for Tail. Therefore, perhaps the initial direction needs to be adjusted.

Given that current direction is LEFT, but maybe the first move should be RIGHT instead of LEFT.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and need to proceed with possible moves.

Let me consider moving Right twice:

First move: from (5,4) → (6,4). Now, check if this is allowed. Since it's not a body segment except Tail, then proceed.

Second move: move from (6,4) → (7,4), which is the apple position.

But let's verify for collisions:

After first move to (6,4): since this is moving into Body1 (from head at (5,4)), and it's not the tail, perhaps it's allowed. Then in the second move, moving from (6,4) → (7,4), which would be outside the grid? Wait no: if y=4 and we add 0, so perhaps that's acceptable.

But wait, perhaps this isn't correct because once you move to a position adjacent to the head, it could block movement further. Alternatively, perhaps let's consider whether moving left or right is possible without hitting obstacles.

Since the body has segments at (6,4) and (6,5), perhaps moving from (5,4) to (6,4) is allowed because it's not a body segment except Tail. Then moving again would be to (7,4).

Therefore, perhaps the path is:

Move Right → (6,4)

Then Move Right → (7,4)

So in this case, two moves to the right.

But let me check for any collisions during these steps.

First move: from (5,4) to (6,4). Since this position isn't a body segment except Tail? Wait, perhaps if it's not the tail, then it's allowed. Let's see:

The tail is part of the snake's body, but when moving into Body1 or Body2, perhaps that's acceptable unless it's a collision.

But perhaps since (6,4) isn't the tail yet, this move is allowed.

Second move: from (6,4) to (7,4). Again, not a body segment except Tail? So maybe allowed.

Therefore, the path would be two moves right.

Thus, the sequence of body parts would be:

- Move Right → (6,4)
- Move Right → (7,4)

So in terms of direction and steps, perhaps it's moving "RIGHT" twice.

But let me verify if this is possible without hitting any other segments or obstacles.

Since the body has [(6,4), (6,5)], then after moving to (6,4), which is Body1, that's allowed unless we're at Tail. Since we haven't reached Tail yet, perhaps it's okay.

Then from (6,4) to (7,4): since this is within the grid and not a body segment except Tail, it's allowed.

Therefore, the path would be:

- First move: RIGHT → (6,4)
- Second move: RIGHT → (7,4)

Thus, the snake moves right twice.

But let me also check for any collision rules when moving into Body segments except Tail.

When moving from (5,4) to (6,4), which is a body segment except Tail. So perhaps this causes a collision because we're entering a body cell that's not Tail during this move.

Therefore, perhaps this move isn't allowed.

This suggests that the initial direction should be adjusted or that another path is needed.

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT first would allow a different path.

If current direction is LEFT, but let's see:

From (5,4) → moving LEFT to (4,4). Then from there, perhaps moving RIGHT twice.

But perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe it's better to look for the possible moves based on given information.

Given that the problem states "You are currently facing a direction and you have certain body segments". Perhaps in order to model correctly, we should consider the path as follows:

- The snake starts with [Head], followed by Body1 at (6,4), Body2 at (6,5).

Thus, when moving from (5,4) → right would go into (6,4) which is Body1.

But perhaps since this is a body segment and not the tail yet, it's allowed unless we are about to move again beyond it.

This suggests that perhaps moving Right isn't possible without causing a collision because we land on Body1 during movement.

Therefore, perhaps the initial direction should be LEFT instead of RIGHT. Let me try that:

First move: from (5,4) → moving LEFT to (4,4). Now check for collisions. Since this is not a body segment except Tail yet, it's allowed.

Second move: from (4,4) → moving RIGHT to (5,4), which would be the tail position? Wait no: perhaps after moving to (5,4), but that might cause another collision.

Alternatively, maybe starting with LEFT isn't correct. Perhaps the initial direction is LEFT, but then in order to reach the apple without hitting any body segments, we need to find a way to move right twice.

But this seems complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that moving Right twice from (5,4) leads us to (7,4), considering that during each move into Body1 and Body2 except when about to step beyond them.

Thus, the path would be:

- Move RIGHT → (6,4)
- Move RIGHT → (7,4)

Therefore, the direction is RIGHT twice.

The snake moves right twice from its initial position at (5,4) to reach the apple located at (7,4). 

Answer: The snake moves two steps to the RIGHT.
