========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this Snake problem. The snake is at (5,5), and the apple is at (1,6). I need to find a safe path for the head to reach the apple without colliding with walls or its own body.

First, looking at the coordinates, the head is at (5,5) which is near the center of the grid. The apple is at (1,6), so that's towards the top-left corner. Since the snake starts with no body segments (BODY list is empty), it can move freely as long as it doesn't reverse direction immediately.

The current direction is "NONE", meaning any first move is allowed. I need to plan a path from (5,5) to (1,6). Let's think about the movement required:

- The x-coordinate needs to decrease by 4 (from 5 to 1).
- The y-coordinate needs to increase by 1 (from 5 to 6).

So overall, I'll need more left moves than rights and one up move.

Let me sketch a possible path. Maybe moving left first to reduce the x-coordinate. Let's say the snake starts by moving LEFT multiple times until it gets close to the apple.

Wait, but after each move, the body updates. Since the initial BODY is empty, the first few moves won't have any body segments to collide with, except when the tail might get in the way if the body grows.

But since initially, there's no body, moving LEFT four times would take the head from (5,5) to (1,5). Then, moving UP once would take it to (1,6), which is where the apple is. That seems straightforward.

So let me map this out step by step:

1. Move LEFT: new_head becomes (4,5).
2. Next move LEFT again: (3,5).
3. Another LEFT: (2,5).
4. And another LEFT: (1,5).
5. Then, move UP to reach (1,6).

Each of these moves is safe because the body remains empty until the apple is eaten. When moving towards the apple, each step doesn't have any body segments in the way.

Let me check if this path meets all conditions:

- No reversal: Since the initial direction is NONE, I can choose LEFT four times followed by UP.
- After eating the apple at (1,6), the snake's head moves there, and the body grows. The new state would have a body segment at (5,5) added to the front of the BODY list. But since we're not considering future moves beyond eating the apple, I just need to ensure that after eating, the next move is possible.

Wait, according to the movement update rule, when the head eats the apple, the tail doesn't move. So after eating, the body would have one more segment than before. However, since in this case, the initial body was empty, after eating, the body becomes [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)] because each left move adds a new head and keeps the old positions.

But when moving to eat the apple, the next direction is UP. After eating, the body would be longer, but since we're only considering up to the point of eating, I think it's safe.

So the sequence of moves would be:

["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"]

Each move is valid, doesn't reverse direction (since initial direction is NONE), and leads safely to the apple. 

Let me also consider if there's any collision after each step:

- After first LEFT: no body, so safe.
- Each subsequent LEFT adds a new head position without overlapping with any existing body segments since they're empty initially.
- The final UP move from (1,5) to (1,6) is towards the apple and doesn't hit any body segments.

Yes, this seems like a valid path. I don't see any immediate collisions or reversals that would cause death.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves left four times to reduce its x-coordinate from 5 to 1, then moves up once to reach the apple at (1,6). This path avoids all collisions and safely navigates the head to the target."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (1, 6). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
