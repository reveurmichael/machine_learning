<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake starts at (2,6) and needs to reach the apple at (3,5). The current direction is "UP", which means moving up increases the y-coordinate. 

First, let me visualize the starting position. The head is at (2,6), so that's somewhere in the middle of the grid on the left side towards the top since higher y values are up. The apple is at (3,5), which is one cell to the right and one cell down from the head.

Looking at the body cells: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. So the snake's body starts just below the head moving down along x=2. Since this is a 10x10 grid, I don't have to worry about immediate wall collisions except for when moving beyond y=9 or below y=0.

The current direction is "UP", which would take the head from (2,6) to (2,7). Let me check if that's possible. The new head position after moving UP is (2,7), which is within bounds since 0 ≤ x <10 and 0 ≤ y<10.

Next, I need to ensure that this new head doesn't collide with any body cells except possibly the tail when it moves. Currently, the body cells are at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). The new head is at (2,7), which isn't in the body list, so no collision here.

Since there's no apple involved yet, the snake will move normally without growing. That means I need to update the body by moving each segment forward and removing the tail. 

So the current body is [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. When moving UP, the new head is added at the front: [(2,7), 2,5], but wait no—the correct process is to insert the old head into the front of the body and then remove the tail if not eating. So after moving, the body becomes [(4,6)], which isn't right.

Wait, maybe I messed up. The initial snake's head is (2,6), followed by the body cells: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ]. So when direction is UP, the new head is (2,7). Then the body list should be updated by inserting (2,6) at the front. Since there's no apple eaten, we remove the last element of the body.

So after moving, the new snake becomes:
[
    (2,7),
    [previous first body segment] (2,5)
]

Wait, that can't be right because the initial body segments are [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], so inserting (2,6) at front makes it [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. Then since no apple is eaten, we remove the last element: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So the snake's new position after moving UP would be head at (2,7) and body segments from (2,6) to (2,4).

But wait, when you move UP once, your next position is (2,7). But looking at the example movement where the head was at (5,5), moving RIGHT added a new segment. So in this case, after moving, the new body would be [(2,6) inserted at front], and then remove last element if not eating apple.

Wait no: Let's re-examine the steps:

1. Compute new_head = (2+0, 6+1) → (2,7)
2. Check for collisions:
   - Is (2,7) in body? Body is [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] → no collision.
3. Update body: insert old head into front of body list → new body is [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]
   - Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]

So the new snake's position is [(2,7) as head, followed by (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the initial body was [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ], so when we insert the old head at front and remove last element if not eating apple.

So after moving UP:

Head is now at (2,7). The body segments are:
- Body1: (2,6)
- Body2: (2,5)
- Body3: (2,4)

So yes, that's correct. Next step is to check for collisions again if I were to move further.

But since we're trying to reach the apple at (3,5), let me see how many moves it would take.

From head (2,6) to apple (3,5):

The change in x is +1, and y changes from 6 down to 5 → -1. So net movement: right once and down once.

But since the snake has a body behind it, moving directly might cause issues. The current direction is UP, so if I continue moving UP again, that would try to go beyond (2,7) into (2,8), but wait:

Wait, no—after first move, new head is at (2,7). Next movement could be RIGHT.

So perhaps the optimal path is to turn right from UP to face towards the apple.

But need to check if that's possible without colliding with body segments.

Let me plan a step-by-step path.

Current position after first move: Head at (2,7), body segments [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)].

Next direction is RIGHT. So new_head would be (3,7).

Check if that's safe:

- Is (3,7) in any body segments? Current body is [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)], so no collision except when moving into the tail position after this step.

Since we're not eating an apple yet, remove last element of body. So inserting new_head (3,7) at front and then removing last element:

New body becomes [(3,7), (2,6), (2,5)].

So now head is at (3,7). Next move: down to (3,8) would be UP again? Wait no—current direction was RIGHT. If we choose another direction, it could cause issues with movement reversal or blocking.

Wait the movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction on a single move. So after moving UP once, next can't move DOWN because they are opposite directions (DOWN is reverse of UP). So in this case, after moving UP, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

But since our goal is to reach (3,5), which is down and left from current position (2,6) → but now we've moved to (2,7), so perhaps it's better to move RIGHT first.

Wait I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline each step carefully.

Current state after moving UP once:

Head: (2,7)

Body segments:
- Body1: (2,6)
- Body2: (2,5)
- Body3: (2,4)

Next possible directions: LEFT or RIGHT since cannot reverse from UP.

Option 1: Move RIGHT to face towards the apple. Let's see if that's safe.

New_head = (3,7).

Check for collisions:

Body segments are [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] → no collision except possibly when tail moves.

No apple eaten yet, so body is updated by adding new head and removing last segment:

Body becomes [(3,7), (2,6), (2,5)]

Now check for collisions with next move. But since we're not moving towards the apple again yet, this seems okay.

But wait, after moving RIGHT to (3,7), what's the body? Now the snake is longer? No—it's just moved forward without eating an apple, so body remains same length minus tail removed.

Wait no: When you move normally, you add new head at front and remove last element of body. So if current body has 3 segments, after moving:

new_body = [new_head] + old_body[:-1]

So initial body is [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]

After moving RIGHT, new_head is (3,7). Insert into front: [ (3,7), (2,6), (2,5) ]

Then remove last element → [ (3,7), (2,6) ]

So now the body has two segments: Body1 = (2,6), Body2 = (3,7)

Wait no—wait. Wait original body was three segments [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], but after moving up once, it became [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)].

After that, when moving RIGHT to (3,7):

new_body becomes [ (3,7) ] + old_body → which is [ (3,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]

But since it's not an apple move, we remove the last element: body becomes [(3,7), (2,6), (2,5)]

Wait no—the initial step was moving UP once:

Old head is (2,6). Move to (2,7). Insert at front of body → [ (2,7) ] + old_body = [ (2,7), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ]

Then remove last element because not eating apple: becomes [(2,7), (2,5), (2,4)]

Now in the next step:

Old head is (2,7). Body segments are [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. So when moving RIGHT to (3,7):

Insert at front → [ (3,7) ] + [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] = [ (3,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]

Then remove last element since no apple: becomes [(3,7), (2,6), (2,5)]

So the new snake is:

Head at (3,7)

Body1 at (2,6)

Body2 at (2,5)

Wait that seems to have changed. So now Body1 is (2,6) which was previously Body2.

But let me check: The initial body after first UP step was [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. Now when moving RIGHT:

- new_head = (3,7)
- insert into front → [ (3,7), 2,6 ], then remove last element if not eating apple. So the body becomes [ (3,7), (2,6) ]

Wait no—the old_body was [(2,5), (2,4)]? No.

No—after moving UP once:

Old head was (2,6). Insert into front of body → new_body is [ (2,6) ] + [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] = [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element: becomes [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]

So now body is [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]

Then when moving RIGHT:

new_head = 3,7.

Insert into front → [ (3,7) ] + [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ] = [ (3,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]

Since no apple, remove last element: becomes [ (3,7), (2,6), (2,5) ]

So the new snake is:

Head at (3,7)

Body segments:

- Body1: (2,6)
- Body2: (2,5)

Wait that doesn't make sense because 2,5 was previously beyond the head.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is to reach (3,5). So perhaps after moving RIGHT once, now facing towards the apple's position.

From (3,7), if we move DOWN twice, but need to ensure that body doesn't collide.

Alternatively, from (3,7), turning LEFT could bring us closer to (3,5).

Wait let me think: current head is at (3,7). To get to (3,5) would require moving down two steps. But since the snake's body is [(2,6), (2,5)], perhaps that will allow the head to move towards the apple.

But wait:

After moving RIGHT once, the new head is at (3,7). The body segments are [ (2,6), (2,5) ]

Next possible direction: from UP → can't go DOWN yet. Can we turn LEFT or RIGHT?

Wait no—current direction was RIGHT, so next cannot reverse to LEFT immediately.

Wait movement rules say you can change direction except for reversing the previous move. So after moving RIGHT, next moves could be any except RIGHT again (since it's same as before?), wait I think it says "you are not allowed to move in the opposite direction of your last move".

Wait no—looking back at the problem statement:

"you are not allowed to move in the opposite direction of your last move"

So if previous was UP, then can't move DOWN.

But after moving RIGHT once, you can change directions as needed except for being the reverse (like LEFT is reverse of RIGHT), so from RIGHT, next could be any except LEFT?

Or do they mean that the previous single step's direction cannot be repeated? The problem statement isn't entirely clear. But according to standard snake movement rules, you typically cannot immediately reverse direction.

But looking at the initial example: moving RIGHT once and then again—no immediate reversal. So perhaps in this case, after moving RIGHT, next move can be any except LEFT (as it's reverse of RIGHT).

So from position [(3,7), (2,6), (2,5)], with head at (3,7), direction is RIGHT.

If I choose to move DOWN instead:

new_head would be (3,8). Check if that collides with body. Current body segments are [ (2,6), (2,5) ] → no collision.

Update the body by adding new_head and removing last element since not eating apple:

new_body = [ (3,8) ] + [ (2,6) ] → becomes [(3,8), (2,6)]

Wait wait—the initial body after moving RIGHT was [(3,7), (2,6), (2,5)]. So inserting new_head at front: [ (3,8) ] + [ (3,7)? No.

No—when you move RIGHT from (3,7) to (4,7). Wait no, wait earlier calculation:

Wait the head is moving RIGHT so x increases by 1. From (3,7) → (4,7).

I think I messed up that part before when calculating direction after first step.

So let's correct this: After first UP move from (2,6), new_head was (2,7). Body segments are [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. Now, moving RIGHT would change x by +1 to 3, y remains same at 7 → so new_head is (3,7).

But wait no: the movement from current head position. Wait correction:

Wait initial snake after first move UP has body segments [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]. So when moving RIGHT again, it's x increases by 1 to 3.

So new_head is (3,7). Now check for collisions: current body is [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] → no collision except if the next step would cause self-collision with tail movement. So moving normally:

Inserting head at front and removing last element gives [ (3,7) ] + [ (2,6), (2,5) ]

So new_body is [(3,7), (2,6), (2,5)]

No collision detected.

Now from here, to reach (3,5):

Need two moves down: from 7→8→9?

Wait no—head at (3,7). To get to (3,5) requires moving down twice. But the snake has body segments that are in front of it.

If I move DOWN again:

new_head = (3,6)

Is this safe? Current body is [(2,6), (2,5)]. So new_head at (3,6). Check if any segment: no collision with current body except when moving into the tail's position after step. Since we're not eating apple yet.

Update body:

Insert head (3,6) at front → [ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) ]

Then remove last element as not eating apple → [(3,6), (2,6)]

So now snake is:

Head: (3,6)

Body1: (2,6)

Which seems to be overlapping with the body segment. Because Body1 at (2,6). The new head is at (3,6); moving down from there would take us into y=5.

Wait but if I move again DOWN from (3,6), that's allowed? Let me think.

Current state after second step: head at (3,7) → moved RIGHT to (4,7). Wait no—it’s getting too tangled. Maybe I need a better approach.

Alternative plan:

From initial position, the head is at (2,6); body behind at (2,5), (2,4).

We can move UP once to get closer to apple: new_head (2,7)

Then from there, turn RIGHT towards the apple's direction. Now facing east.

Now moving right once: new_head (3,7). Check if that position is okay—no body in [(2,6), (2,5)].

Then move DOWN twice:

First step down to (3,6): no problem; body becomes [ (3,6), (2,6) ]

Second step down to (3,5): which is the apple. But we need to check for collision.

Wait when moving from (3,6) → trying to go to (3,5). So new_head would be (3,5).

Check if that's in current body:

Current body after previous move was [(3,6), (2,6)].

So no collision. But also need to check for self-collision when tail moves: the tail is at (2,6) which isn't moving into (3,5). So seems okay.

But wait—when we reach apple position via moving down from (3,6):

new_head = (3,5).

Check if that's in body:

Current body after last step was [(3,6), (2,6)]. So no collision. Then update the body by inserting new_head at front and removing tail.

So new_body would be [ (3,5) ] + [(3,6)] → [ (3,5), (3,6) ]

Since we did eat apple? Or not—since it's just moving down to reach there. Wait in this case, the movement is towards the apple but didn't actually eat it yet.

Wait no—the problem says "if you manage to reach", so maybe once head reaches (3,5), that counts as reaching.

But according to game rules, sometimes apples are eaten when you land on them—so perhaps the snake needs to move over the apple's position during its movement. But in this case, after moving down from (3,6)→(3,5). So head is now at (3,5), which is the target.

So overall steps:

1. Move UP: new_head = (2,7)
   - Check for collision? Body was [(2,6), ...] → no.
   - Update body to [ (2,7) ] + rest without last element → becomes [(2,7), (2,5), (2,4)]

Wait wait—the initial move UP adds new_head at front and removes tail.

So after step 1:

- Head: (2,6) moved up to (2,7)
- Body was [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ] → insert head → [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] then remove last element (2,4): body becomes [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]

Step 2: Move RIGHT from (2,7):

new_head = (3,7)
- Body was [ (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ]
   insert head at front → [ (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ] 
   then remove last element (2,5): body becomes [(3,7), (2,7), (2,6)]

Step 3: Move DOWN from (3,7):

new_head = (3,6)
- Body was [ (3,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]
   insert head at front → [ (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6) ] 
   then remove last element (2,6): body becomes [(3,6), (3,7), (2,7)]

But now the snake's body is:

Head: (3,6)

Body1: (3,7)

Body2: (2,7)

So when moving down from (3,7) to (3,6):

Wait that’s not correct. From position (3,7), moving DOWN decreases y by 1 → new_head would be (3,6).

But the current body is [ (3,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

So inserting head at front: [(3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6)] 

Then removing last element since not eating apple → becomes [(3,6), (3,7), (2,7)]

But the body segment is now:

Head: (3,6)

Body1: (3,7)

Body2: (2,7)

Wait that seems okay. Now step 4: move DOWN again to reach (3,5):

new_head = (3,5).

Check for collision with current body [(3,6), (3,7), (2,7)]: no.

Update body by inserting new_head at front → [ (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7) ]

Then remove last element as not eating apple → becomes [ (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) ]

So now head is at (3,5). So we reached the target.

Therefore, it took 4 moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN.

But need to check if all these steps are allowed in terms of snake movement and no collisions.

Wait:

Step 1: Move UP from (2,6) → (2,7): no problem. Body is [(2,7), (2,5), (2,4)]

Wait wait—the body after moving UP was supposed to be [ (2,6) moved to front? Or does the initial body change differently.

I think my confusion arises from how exactly the snake's body is updated.

Let me re-express this:

Each move consists of moving the head in a direction. The tail moves forward one segment each time unless an apple is eaten or if it blocks itself.

But since no apples are eaten until reaching (3,5), the tail will always move forward by one position per move except when the snake has eaten an apple.

So initial body after step 1:

After UP:

head: (2,7)

body was [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] → becomes [ (2,7) ] + rest without last element? Or is it inserting new_head at front and then remove the tail?

Actually, when moving forward, the snake's body segments shift by one. The head moves to new position, each other segment follows the previous.

So in terms of code-like representation:

old_body = [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]

new_head = (3,7) after RIGHT move

new_body = [ (3,7) ] + old_body except last element → so new_body becomes [(3,7), (2,6), (2,5)]

Yes.

But in step 1:

initial head: (2,6)

body segments: [ (2,6)'s front is where the head moves to. Wait no—probably better to model it as each move shifts the body forward by one.

Wait I think this can be simplified with an example.

Let me consider that after each move in a direction, all body parts follow:

When moving RIGHT from (2,7):

new_head = 3,7

Each subsequent segment is shifted to their previous positions. So new_body would have the head at front and rest as per shifting.

But perhaps it's easier to model by thinking of the snake's position as a list where each element represents a body part in order from head to tail.

So initial state:

head: (2,6)

body_parts = [ (2,5), (2,4) ]

Wait no—the problem states that the body is given as [ (2,5), (2,6), ... ]—no wait the initial input was 10 elements for each coordinate.

Wait in the original problem statement:

The snake's body is given as an array: [[x0,y0], ..., [xn,yn]]

Wait perhaps I've been getting confused because of multiple coordinates. Let me clarify.

In this problem, both the head and body parts are given as separate arrays—head is x1, y1; then body segments are x2 to xn+1 for each coordinate.

But in any case, when moving forward, each segment follows the one in front.

So, perhaps an alternative approach:

Each time we move in a direction, all body segments shift by one position except the head. The tail may stay or not, depending on whether the snake is eating an apple.

Wait no—each step moves the head to new position; each other segment follows the previous position of their respective next part.

So for instance:

If current body parts are [A, B, C], where A is head at (2,6), B at (2,5), C at (2,4)

Moving RIGHT → x increases by 1: new_head = (3,6). Then the rest shift such that next position after tail follows.

Wait perhaps it's better to consider each step as moving one segment:

The snake is represented as a list of coordinates from head to tail. When you move in a direction, you add the head at the front and remove the last element if no apple eaten (i.e., self-shifting by 1). If an apple is eaten, then sometimes the length remains same.

Wait perhaps for code purposes, it's better to model as:

snake = [head] + body

where each move shifts snake: new_snake = [new_head] + snake[:-1]

But apples are eaten when you land on them; so during a movement that takes you onto an apple coordinate (x,y), if (x,y) is the position of the apple, then after moving there, the tail remains as is.

Wait in this problem, since we're just trying to reach the apple's position, perhaps it doesn't matter about eating—but wait, no: in reality, when you land on an apple, it gets eaten and sometimes the snake can have longer length or not.

But in this specific problem statement, I think reaching (3,5) is considered as success regardless of whether you eat the apple or not. So we don't need to track that; just ensure head reaches there without collision.

So perhaps:

At each step, move head in direction chosen, check for self-collision by seeing if new_head is in snake's body segments (excluding itself? Or including?)

Wait no—the snake can't have its own body as part of the next position. So when moving to new_head, that coordinate must not be present anywhere else in the current snake's body.

But also, since after moving, each segment follows: so if during movement we are about to occupy a position that is already occupied by a previous body part (other than head), then collision occurs.

So for example:

Current snake: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]

Move UP → new_head (2,7): check if it's in current body parts? No. Then add to front and remove last element.

Wait no—when moving head forward, the next positions are shifted by one.

So:

current snake: [ A, B, C ] where A is head

new_head = D → new_snake becomes [D] + [A,B,C][:-1] if not eating apple. So in that case, after move, it's [D,A,B]

If we do eat apple, then sometimes the tail remains or doesn't shift.

But perhaps this can be simplified with code-like logic:

Each move consists of:

- Determine new head position based on direction.
- Check for collision: is new_head in current snake body (excluding itself?)
   - Or more precisely, when you add new_head to front and shift others, does it overlap?
Wait no—it's better to check whether moving into the new_head would result in any part of the snake overlapping with itself.

So for example:

current_snake = [ A, B, C ]

new_head is D. Then after adding D at front: [D,A,B,C]

But if we don't eat apple, then remove last element to get [D,A,B].

If we do eat an apple (i.e., new_head is the apple's position), perhaps snake remains same length? Or maybe it can grow?

In this problem, since we just need to reach a specific coordinate, I think we don't have to worry about whether the apple was eaten or not. So let's model as:

Each move:
- compute new_head
- check if new_head is in current_snake (excluding itself? Or including?)
Wait no—the head can never be part of its own body except for initial position.

But probably, when moving, we need to make sure that the next head position does not coincide with any other segment's coordinate.

So step-by-step plan:

1. Find target: [3,5]
2. Current snake is [[2,6],[2,5],[2,4]]
   - So current head is (2,6), body parts are [(2,5),(2,4)]
   
Wait no—wait the initial problem statement says that in a code example:

snake = [[[x0,y0], [x1,y1], ...]]

But perhaps it's better to have snake as list of coordinates with head first.

So initial snake is: [[2,6], [2,5], [2,4]]
target is (3,5)

We need to find a path from current position to target without colliding with itself.

Let me plan the moves step by step:

Move 1: UP
head becomes (2,7)
snake after move: [[2,7], [2,6], [2,5]]

Check if any collision? Current snake body is [(2,6), (2,5)], new_head is (2,7): no.

So proceed.

Move 2: RIGHT
new_head = (3,7)
snake after move: [[3,7], [2,7], [2,6]]

Check for collision in current snake before moving. Current snake's body parts are [(2,7), (2,6)] → new head is (3,7): no.

Move 3: DOWN
new_head = (3,6)
snake after move: [[3,6], [3,7], [2,7]]

Check collision with current snake before moving? Current body parts are [(3,7), (2,7)] → new head is (3,6): not in them.

Move 4: DOWN again
new_head = (3,5)
snake after move: [[3,5], [3,6], [3,7]]

Now check collision with current snake before moving? Current body parts are [(3,6), (3,7)] → new head is (3,5): not in them.

So this seems to have worked. So it took 4 moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN.

But wait—can I do it in fewer steps?

Let me see:

Alternative path after step1 and step2 as before:

At move3: trying LEFT instead of DOWN? Let's try.

After step2, snake is [[3,7], [2,7], [2,6]]

If we move LEFT from (3,7):

new_head = (2,7)
Check if in current body parts: yes! Because current body has a segment at (2,7). So collision occurs. Not allowed.

So can't go LEFT after step2.

How about step4 as DOWN:

After step3's position is [[3,6], [3,7], [2,7]]

If move UP instead of DOWN: new_head = (3,5) from moving UP → wait no.

Wait sorry—current head is at (3,6). Moving UP would take it to (3,7), but that's where the snake already has a segment. So can't do that.

Alternatively, after step2:

snake is [[3,7], [2,7], [2,6]]

Maybe instead of moving DOWN next, move another direction?

Let me see possible directions from (3,7):

Possible moves: RIGHT (to 4,7), LEFT (2,7)—but that's body part. So no.

So can't go LEFT or RIGHT in this case because they are blocked by own body parts.

Hence, only possible move is DOWN to (3,6).

Thus, step3 must be DOWN.

After step3:

snake: [[3,6], [3,7], [2,7]]

Now from here, can we reach (3,5) without collision?

Possible moves from head position (3,6):

UP → 3,7 which is blocked by the snake's body part. So no.

DOWN → new_head = (3,5). Check if in current body parts: current body after step2 was [ (3,7), (2,7) ] → now when moving to (3,5), it's not present. So move allowed.

Thus, step4 is DOWN from (3,6).

So same as before—four steps needed.

Is there a way with three steps?

Let me think differently: Is there another path that reaches the target in fewer moves?

Alternative approach:

Step1: UP to (2,7)

snake now: [ (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ]

Check collision? No.

Move2: DOWN → new_head = (3,7). Current snake body is [ (2,7), (2,6) ]. So moving to (3,7): no collision.

snake now: [ (3,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]

Step3: LEFT → new_head = (2,7). But that's in current body. Can't do it.

Move3: RIGHT is not possible because would take us to 4,7 which is empty.

Move3: DOWN from (3,7) to (3,6): same as before. So four steps again.

Alternative move after step2:

Is there another direction?

Wait in step1 and step2:

After step1: head at (2,7); body parts [(2,6), (2,5)] → no collision when moving RIGHT.

Step2: Move DOWN from (3,7) to (3,6). Current snake would be [ (3,6), (3,7), (2,7) ]

Wait if I instead of moving down move another direction:

But in step1 head is at (2,7); body parts [(2,6), (2,5)]

From here, possible moves: LEFT → 1,7? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after step1 and before step2, could we make a different turn?

Wait perhaps it's impossible to reach target in less than four steps because the snake has to navigate around its own body parts.

So perhaps four steps are needed.

Thus, the path is:

UP → RIGHT → DOWN × 2

But wait—each move is UP, then RIGHT, then two Downs. So that’s four moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its initial position `[2,6]` with body parts at `[2,5]` and `[2,4]` towards the target position `(3,5)`. The goal is to determine the sequence of moves required for the snake's head to reach the target without colliding with any part of its own body.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at `x=2`, so moving right will increase the x-coordinate. Moving up increases the y-coordinate, while moving down decreases it.
2. **Move Strategy**:
   - Move UP to `(2,7)`.
   - Then move RIGHT to `(3,7)`.
   - Finally, move DOWN twice consecutively to reach `(3,5)` without colliding with any part of the snake's body.

### Solution Code
```javascript
function solution() {
    // The initial position and direction of the snake head is at (2,6)
    const currentSnake = [[2, 6], [2, 5], [2, 4]];
    const targetPosition = [3, 5];
    
    let steps = [];
    
    // Step 1: Move UP to reach (2,7)
    move(currentSnake, 'UP', steps);
    
    // Step 2: Move RIGHT to reach (3,7)
    move(currentSnake, 'RIGHT', steps);
    
    // Steps required:
    // [ 'UP', 'RIGHT', 'DOWN', 'DOWN' ]
    return JSON.stringify(steps);
}

function move(snake, direction, steps) {
    let head = snake[0];

```

### Explanation
The snake starts at `[2,6]` and moves up to `(2,7)`, then right to `(3,7)`. From there, it moves down twice to reach `(3,5)` without colliding with its own body. Each move is checked for collision both with the current position and previous positions of the snake's body parts. The sequence of moves ensures that each step avoids any potential collisions, allowing the snake to successfully navigate to the target position in four steps.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)], to eat the apple at (3, 5).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
