{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (6,0) with a long body along the right and top edges. To reach the apple at (4,7), the safest path is to move UP first to avoid the bottom edge and get closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Moving UP 7 times brings the head to (6,7), then moving LEFT twice reaches (4,7) (the apple). This path avoids the body (which occupies the right and top edges) and ensures no collisions."
