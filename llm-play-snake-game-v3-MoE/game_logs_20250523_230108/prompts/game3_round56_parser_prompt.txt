Okay, so I need to help plan a safe path for the snake's head from position (6,5) to eat the apple at (7,4). Let me start by understanding all the given information and rules.

First, the snake's body cells are provided as [(5,5), (4,5)]. So the snake has three segments: head at (6,5), then two body parts. Wait, no—the input says "Body cells" which includes from behind the head to tail. The body list is ordered as immediate behind head to tail. So for this case, the body cells are [(5,5), (4,5)], but wait, the head is at (6,5). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, no—the snake's full S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2,...]. Each BODYi is adjacent to its predecessor. The given Body cells list includes from behind the head to tail. So in this case, the body segments are [(5,5), (4,5)], meaning that the body starts at (5,5) and then moves to (4,5). Wait, but the head is at (6,5). That might be confusing.

Wait, perhaps the given Body cells list is from behind the head to tail. So if the head is at (6,5), then the next segment would be either (5,5) or something else. But according to the input, it's [(5,5), (4,5)]. Maybe I should consider that the body starts at (5,5) and goes to (4,5). So the full snake S is [head, (5,5), (4,5)]? Wait, but the head is given as (6,5). Hmm, perhaps this is a bit confusing. Let's try to parse it.

Wait, maybe the head is at (6,5), and the body cells list starts from behind the head. So if the body segments are [(5,5), (4,5)], that might mean the body starts at (5,5) and goes to (4,5). But then where's the head? Because the head is given as (6,5). Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the full snake S includes the head and all body segments. So if the Body cells list is [(5,5), (4,5)], that might mean that before the head, there are no body parts except for the tail. This is getting a bit tangled. Let's focus on movement rules instead.

The current direction is "RIGHT". The snake's head is at (6,5). Each move proceeds by computing new_head based on direction vectors. For example, moving right would add 1 to x, so new_head would be (7,5). But wait, that might not make sense because the grid is only 10x10.

But perhaps I should start by determining the snake's current state. The head is at (6,5), and the body cells are [(5,5), (4,5)]. Wait, but if the head is at (6,5), then perhaps the body segments are behind it? Maybe the body starts from (5,5) and moves to (4,5). So the snake's body is from (5,5) back to (6,5)? That doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe the given Body cells list is [(5,5), (4,5)] which are adjacent to each other. Since the direction is RIGHT, perhaps the head is at (6,5), and moving right would take it to (7,5). But let's proceed step by step.

The apple is at (7,4). So the snake needs to reach from (6,5) to (7,4). The direction given is RIGHT. Since the current direction is RIGHT, perhaps we should check if moving in that direction is possible without hitting any body segments or causing collisions.

But wait, let's think about the movement rules. When computing new_head, it's added by direction vectors. So for a RIGHT move, new_head would be (x+1, y). But we need to ensure that this new position doesn't go out of grid bounds and isn't already occupied by another body part.

The snake's current state: head at (6,5), with body segments [(5,5), (4,5)]. Wait, perhaps the body starts from the previous segment. So if the direction is RIGHT, moving to (7,5) would be one possibility, but we need to check if that position is safe.

Alternatively, maybe the snake's head is at (6,5), and the body segments are [(5,5), (4,5)], meaning that before the head, there was a segment at (5,5), then (4,5). So perhaps when moving right, the new_head would be (7,5), but we need to check if any body part is in the way.

But wait, let's consider the movement example given. When direction is RIGHT, new_head is (6+1,5)=7,5. Then, since this is not inside grid? Wait, no: the grid is 0-9 for both x and y. So (7,5) is within bounds.

But we need to check if this position is already occupied by any body part. The current body segments are [(5,5), (4,5)]. So new_head at (7,5) would not be in those positions. But perhaps when moving, the snake's head moves first, and then the body shifts.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the problem: starting from (6,5), with direction RIGHT, need to reach (7,4). The apple is at (7,4).

Since the initial position is (6,5) as head, moving right would take it to (7,5). But let's check if this is possible.

But perhaps the snake can't move into cells that are already occupied by body parts. So when moving in direction RIGHT, new_head would be (x+1, y). Then, we need to ensure that this position isn't already part of the body segments.

In this case, the current body segments are [(5,5), (4,5)], but perhaps these are behind the head. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's consider that the snake's head is at (6,5), and the body segments are from behind to tail: so if the direction is RIGHT, moving right would take the new_head to (7,5). But we need to check if any body segment is in this position.

Since the body segments given are [(5,5), (4,5)], perhaps these are positions that were previously part of the body when the snake was shorter. So maybe after moving, the head moves right to (7,5), but then the tail would shift back by one, so the new_head would be at (6,5) + direction? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is that the snake's body consists of the segments from behind the head to the tail. So if the head is at (6,5), and the body cells are [(5,5), (4,5)], then perhaps these are positions before the head, meaning the snake was longer.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should focus on the movement rules and the required path.

The required path must start from (6,5) as head, with direction RIGHT. The apple is at (7,4).

Since the initial direction is RIGHT, moving right would take the head to (7,5). But we need to check if this position is safe.

But perhaps the snake's body occupies certain cells that block movement. For example, if the new_head is at (7,5), but there's a body segment at (6,5) or elsewhere? Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, let's consider the given Apple position: (7,4). The head is at (6,5). To reach (7,4), perhaps moving left and down. But since the current direction is RIGHT, perhaps we need to change direction.

But wait, according to movement rules, if the snake's current direction is "RIGHT", choosing another direction is not allowed unless it's a reversal. Wait, no—the rule says you can't reverse on first move. So if your current direction is RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT. But since the problem asks for a path from (6,5) to (7,4), perhaps we need to adjust direction.

But perhaps the initial state allows moving in any direction except reversal. Wait, let's recheck the rules: "Cannot reverse: if current direction is RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT." So after moving right, next can't move left. Similarly for other directions.

Given that the apple is at (7,4), which is to the right and down from (6,5). Since the current direction is RIGHT, perhaps we need to change direction to reach the apple.

But let's consider the movement step by step.

1. Start at head (6,5), direction RIGHT.
2. Compute new_head: (7,5).
3. Check if new_head is within grid. Yes.
4. Check for collision with body segments. The current body segments are [(5,5), (4,5)], which are behind the head. So moving to (7,5) would not collide because it's a new position.
5. Since new_head != apple position (7,4), proceed by removing the last element of the body (tail). So the body becomes [(5,5)]. Then insert the old head (6,5) at front: body is now [(6,5), (5,5)].

Now, check if moving to (7,5) would cause any collision. Since (7,5) isn't in the body segments, which are [(5,5)], it's safe.

Next step: move again.

Current direction remains RIGHT? Or do we change?

Wait, perhaps after each move, the direction may change based on new position and apple location.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline steps:

- Initial state: head at (6,5), direction RIGHT.
- Compute new_head as (7,5).
- Check collision: not in body segments [(5,5), (4,5)]? Wait no: the given Body cells are [(5,5), (4,5)], meaning that before moving, perhaps these were part of the snake's body.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think about how many steps we need.

From (6,5) to (7,4): move right once and down once. So total movement is two steps: one right, one down.

But since current direction is RIGHT, perhaps after moving right to (7,5), then change direction to DOWN.

Wait, let's outline the possible path:

1. Move from (6,5) to (7,5): check if this position is safe.
   - Direction is RIGHT: new_head = (6+1,5)=7,5.
   - Check if it's within grid? Yes.
   - Check collision with body segments [(5,5), (4,5)]? No.
   - Since not apple, proceed by removing tail and inserting head at front. Body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)].

2. Next move: direction is RIGHT again?
   - Compute new_head as (7+1,5)=8,5. But perhaps after moving right to (7,5) in first step, the next move would be DOWN.
   
Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that since current direction is RIGHT, we need to adjust.

But perhaps this approach isn't working. Let's try a different way: from head at (6,5), direction RIGHT, and the apple at (7,4).

We can model possible moves:

Possible moves without considering obstacles would be moving right or down.

Since starting direction is RIGHT, let's see what happens when we change direction to DOWN first.

But perhaps it's better to consider that from (6,5) with direction RIGHT:

- Move to (7,5): check if this is allowed. Since the body segments are [(5,5), (4,5)], moving to (7,5) doesn't collide because it's a new position.

Then, since we arrived at (7,5), which isn't the apple, proceed by removing tail and inserting head at front: body becomes [(6,5)] + [(5,5)]? Wait no. The initial direction is RIGHT, so perhaps after moving right to (7,5), the next move could be DOWN.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating again.

Alternatively, let's consider that from (6,5) with direction RIGHT:

1. Move to (7,5).
2. Then check if this is in any body segment: no.
3. Since not apple, remove the last element of body and insert head at front. So body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)].

Now, position is (7,5). Next move:

1. Current direction is RIGHT again? Or changed to DOWN?

But perhaps after moving right once, we need to change direction down for the next step towards apple.

So from (7,5):

Direction could be DOWN: new_head would be (7+0,5-1)=(7,4). Which is our apple position. Check if this is safe.

Check collision with body segments [(6,5), (5,5)]? The new_head is (7,4).

Is (7,4) in the body segments? No. Also, since current direction was RIGHT after moving to (7,5), perhaps next move can't be LEFT, but since we're at a different position, maybe it's allowed.

Thus, proceed:

Compute new_head as (7+0,5-1)= (7,4). Since this is the apple position, we need to check if moving in that direction would cause collision with any body segments or itself.

But perhaps since moving down from (7,5) would take us to (7,4), which is the apple. So let's see:

Is new_head within grid? Yes.
Is new_head == apple position? Yes: (7,4). Since it's the target, perhaps we can move directly here.

But according to movement rules: if moving into the cell where the apple is located, that would end the game. Wait no—the problem says the apple is at (7,4), so when you reach there, you win.

Thus, perhaps from position (6,5) with direction RIGHT:

1. Move right to (7,5).
2. Check collision: not in body segments [(5,5), (4,5)].
3. Since not apple, remove tail and insert head at front: body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)].

Now position is (7,5).

Next move:

We need to reach (7,4). So from (7,5), moving down would take us to (7,4). Let's see if that's allowed.

Compute new_head as (7+0,5-1)= (7,4).

Check collision with body segments [(6,5), (5,5)]? No. Also, since it's the apple position, perhaps moving here ends the game.

Thus, from (7,5) to (7,4) is a direct move in direction DOWN.

So path would be:

- Move RIGHT from (6,5) to (7,5).
- Then move DOWN from (7,5) to (7,4).

But wait, perhaps the initial movement with direction RIGHT leads us to (7,5), then changing direction down brings us to (7,4). So total moves: two steps.

Now, let's check if this path is valid:

1. Starting at head (6,5).
2. Move right once: new_head (7,5). Check collision with body segments [(5,5), (4,5)]? No.
3. Since not apple, proceed by removing last element of body (tail) and inserting head at front: body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)].

Now position is (7,5).

Next step:

- From (7,5), move down to (7,4). Check if this is allowed.
   - Compute new_head as (7+0,5-1)= (7,4).
   - Check collision with body segments [(6,5), (5,5)]? No.
   - Since it's the apple position, we can end here.

Thus, total moves: two steps. However, perhaps this is not the correct path because perhaps moving right once isn't necessary if there's a shorter way or due to movement constraints.

Alternatively, maybe after moving right, you need to change direction down.

But let's think about how many steps it would take:

From (6,5), moving right once to (7,5). Then moving down once to reach apple. That's two moves.

Thus, the directions taken are RIGHT followed by DOWN. But since initial direction is RIGHT, perhaps after that, we need to change direction.

But according to movement rules: you can't reverse direction on first move unless it's a reversal.

Wait, perhaps the initial direction is RIGHT, so moving right once would be allowed. Then, if you choose another direction (like DOWN), perhaps it's not allowed because of the reversal rule.

Thus, this suggests that after moving in one direction, any subsequent moves must continue in that direction or turn only when necessary without reversing.

This complicates things. Perhaps I should model each step more carefully.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Start at head (6,5), direction RIGHT.
2. Compute new_head as (7,5).
3. Check if this is within grid: yes.
4. Check collision with body segments [(5,5), (4,5)]? No.
5. Since not apple position, proceed by removing last element of body and inserting head at front:
   - Body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)].
6. Now position is (7,5).
7. Next move: direction is RIGHT again?
   - Compute new_head as (8,5). But maybe after moving right once to (7,5), the next step could be DOWN.
   - Or perhaps change direction down.

Let's try changing direction down from (7,5) to (7,4).

Compute new_head as (7+0,5-1)= (7,4).
Check collision: no body segments except [(6,5), (5,5)]. So new_head is safe.
Since it's the apple position, we can end here.

Thus, path would be:

- Move RIGHT from (6,5) to (7,5).
- Then move DOWN to reach (7,4).

This seems valid. Thus, directions taken are RIGHT followed by DOWN.

But let's check if this is allowed according to movement rules.

After moving right once, the direction remains RIGHT until we change it down.

Thus, perhaps in terms of moves:

1. Move from (6,5) to (7,5): direction RIGHT.
2. Then move from (7,5) to (7,4): direction DOWN.

Each step is considered a separate move according to movement rules.

Therefore, the directions would be "RIGHT" followed by "DOWN".

Thus, in terms of output, perhaps it's written as ["RIGHT", "DOWN"] or something similar.

But let me verify:

Starting position: head (6,5), direction RIGHT.
First move: new_head is (7,5). Since this is not the apple and within grid, proceed. Body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)] after removing tail and inserting head at front? Wait no: initial body was [(5,5), (4,5)], perhaps?

Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body segments are structured.

Perhaps in the problem statement, the Body cells represent the snake's body parts as it moves. For example, when moving RIGHT from (6,5) to (7,5), the new head is at (7,5), and the tail would be removed along with the previous position.

Thus, perhaps after each move, the direction changes accordingly.

But this could get complicated without a clear model of how body segments change.

Given that I'm a bit stuck, perhaps it's better to consider that moving from (6,5) in right direction once gets us closer to apple at (7,4), and then we can adjust direction down.

Thus, the directions would be RIGHT followed by DOWN.

Therefore, the answer could be ["RIGHT", "DOWN"].
</think>

The path involves moving right first to reach a position near the apple, then changing direction down. 

Answer: 
["RIGHT", "DOWN"]
