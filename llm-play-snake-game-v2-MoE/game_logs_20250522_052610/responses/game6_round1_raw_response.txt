========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to help an AI plan a safe path for a snake in the classic Snake game to reach and eat the apple without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds. The current state is given with the head at (5,5), direction as NONE, no body cells, and the apple at (9,5). 

First, I need to understand the movement rules thoroughly. The snake can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. It cannot reverse direction immediately unless the current direction is NONE, which allows any move on the first step. Also, moving outside the grid or colliding with body parts leads to death.

The apple is at (9,5), so from the head's position (5,5), it's 4 units to the right and same y-coordinate. The Manhattan distance is 4, which means the shortest path would involve four RIGHT moves. However, I need to make sure that after eating the apple, there's still a way for the snake to move without getting stuck.

Since the body cells are empty, the initial move can be any direction. But considering safety and avoiding unnecessary wall hugging, moving towards the apple directly seems safe. Let me outline possible moves:

1. **First Move**: The current direction is NONE, so any direction is allowed. To start moving towards the apple, the first move should be RIGHT to (6,5). This sets the direction to RIGHT.

2. **Second Move**: Since the direction was RIGHT, the next move cannot be LEFT. From (6,5), moving RIGHT again takes the head to (7,5).

3. **Third Move**: Continue in the same direction to (8,5) by moving RIGHT.

4. **Fourth Move**: Finally, move RIGHT to (9,5), where the apple is located.

After eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment. So, after this move, the body cells will include the previous positions up to (9,5). I need to ensure that there's at least one legal move afterward to avoid trapping the snake. Since the snake is now longer but still has space around the apple, moving UP or DOWN from the head should be possible without collision.

Wait a minute, after eating the apple at (9,5), the next move would have to avoid the body parts. But since the body only extends up to the previous positions before the apple, as long as the snake doesn't reverse direction immediately, it should be fine. However, since the first four moves are all RIGHT, after reaching the apple, the snake's body is from (5,5) to (9,5). The next move would have to not go into any of these positions.

But in this case, after eating the apple, moving UP or DOWN from (9,5) wouldn't cause a collision because those cells aren't part of the body yet. So it's safe.

Another consideration: since the direction is set to RIGHT after each move except the first, the snake can continue moving without reversing. However, in this scenario, once the apple is eaten, the direction would still be NONE? No, wait. After each move, the direction continues unless changed. Since all moves are in the same direction (RIGHT), it's okay.

Wait no, actually, each move after the first must follow the movement rules without reversing. So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT next, but since we're done after four steps, that's not an issue here.

I should also check if there's any possibility of collision with body parts during the moves. Since initially, the body is empty, the first four moves are safe because the snake only adds body segments as it moves. After each move, the body includes all previous positions except the head, so after moving to (6,5), the body has (5,5). Then moving to (7,5) adds (6,5), and so on.

By the time we reach the apple at (9,5), the body is from (5,5) through (8,5). So when moving to (9,5), the head doesn't collide with any part of its body because it's only adding that position after eating. Therefore, all moves are safe.

I think this path is valid and meets all constraints.

{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves directly towards the apple at (9,5) using four consecutive RIGHT moves. Since there's no body obstruction initially, this path is safe and efficient."
}
