========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to help this snake reach the apple safely. The snake's head is at (3,3), and the apple is at (3,2). So, it needs to move left towards the apple. 

First, I need to check if moving left directly would cause any issues. Since the snake has a body that might block its path, I should make sure there's space for the head to move without colliding with anything.

Looking at the current setup, the snake's body is given as an empty list. That means it's just the head segment; no body segments are blocking the way yet. So, moving left from (3,3) would take it to (2,3), which is currently unoccupied because there are no body parts beyond the head.

But wait, after moving, I have to consider how the snake updates its body. When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat the apple, the tail gets removed, and a new segment is added at the front. However, in this case, since we're just moving left towards the apple, which isn't on (3,2), the body won't grow.

Now, I should think about whether moving left would cause any future issues. Since there's no other snake segments beyond the head right now, as long as the new head position is within bounds and not overlapping with the tail or any existing body parts. The head moving to (2,3) seems safe because it doesn't coincide with anything else.

Also, according to the movement rules, after each move, the snake's body is updated by inserting the old head at the front and removing the tail unless it ate the apple. Since we're not eating the apple here, the tail gets removed. But since there are no other body segments beyond the head, this shouldn't cause any issues.

Another thing to consider is direction reversal. The current direction isn't specified because the snake hasn't moved yet; perhaps I can choose a safe initial direction without worrying about reversing in the first move. Since moving left directly towards the apple is possible and doesn't involve any immediate risks, that seems like a good starting point.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Move left from (3,3) to (2,3).
2. Check for collisions: The new head position isn't outside the grid or overlapping with any body parts.
3. Update the snake's body by adding the old head at the front and removing the tail if not eating the apple.

Since all these steps seem safe, moving left should be a valid first move towards reaching the apple without any immediate issues.
</think>

The snake can safely move left to start moving towards the apple without colliding with its own body or getting trapped. Each subsequent move will continue this direction until it reaches the apple.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving left twice brings the head from (3,3) to (1,3), then further towards the apple at (3,2). The body remains unobstructed as there are no other segments in this short path."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 3) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (3, 2). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
