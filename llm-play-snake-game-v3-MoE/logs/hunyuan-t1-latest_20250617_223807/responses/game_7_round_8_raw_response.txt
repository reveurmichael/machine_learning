========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,9) with direction UP. Since moving UP is out of bounds, the first valid moves are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT avoids immediate collision and aligns with the apple's x-coordinate (6). Subsequent DOWN moves reduce the vertical distance to the apple (from y=9 to y=4). Each DOWN move is safe as the body segments are initially below the head and shift upward, avoiding collision. After reaching the apple (6,4), the snake grows, leaving legal moves (e.g., LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) to avoid trapping."
