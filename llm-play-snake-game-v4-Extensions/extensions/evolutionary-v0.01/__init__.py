"""Evolutionary-v0.01
====================

Proof-of-concept extension that demonstrates a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
planner for Snake.  This is the very first evolutionary package â€“ extremely
simple on purpose.  It reuses *only* common utilities plus core base classes
and keeps every other concern inside this folder so that the pair
`evolutionary-v0.01 + extensions/common` is fully standalone.
