Alright, I'm trying to solve this Snake problem where the head is at (3,3), the apple is at (3,2). The snake's body is a list of positions: [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. The current direction is DOWN. I need to figure out the moves that allow the head to reach the apple safely without colliding with its body or going out of bounds.

First, let's understand the setup. The snake is moving in a 10x10 grid. The head is at (3,3), and the apple is just below it at (3,2). Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP because that would reverse the direction.

Looking at the body cells: starting from the head, which is at (3,3), the body goes down to (3,4), then continues down to (3,5), (3,6), etc., up to (3,8). So the snake is in a vertical line along x=3, from y=3 up to y=8. The tail is at (3,4), but since there's an apple to eat, when we eat it, the tail won't shrink.

The goal is to move from (3,3) to (3,2). Since the head is already above the apple, and the direction is DOWN, that seems like a possible first move. But I need to check if moving DOWN is safe.

Wait, if the current direction is DOWN, then the next move can't be UP because of rule 3—can't reverse direction. So from DOWN, the allowed moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. But moving DOWN again would take the head to (3,4), which is already occupied by the body at (3,4). That's a collision, so that's not allowed.

So, the possible moves from (3,3) with current direction DOWN are LEFT and RIGHT, but we have to see where those lead without causing collisions or going out of bounds.

Looking at the grid:

- Moving LEFT from (3,3) would take the head to (2,3). Is that safe? Let's check if any part of the body is there. The body starts at (5,8) and goes leftwards as it progresses down. So, the positions are (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), etc., so (2,3) isn't occupied by the body. Also, 2 is within x=0 to 9.

- Moving RIGHT would take us to (4,3). Is that safe? Let's check if any part of the body is at (4,3). The body positions are from (5,8) down, so (4,3) isn't part of it. So both LEFT and RIGHT seem possible.

Wait, but we need to plan a path to get to (3,2), which is directly below (3,3). If we move LEFT or RIGHT, how do we get back? Because the apple is at (3,2), so maybe moving in another direction might require more steps, but perhaps it's safer.

Alternatively, can we change direction without reversing? Since current direction is DOWN, next moves cannot be UP. So from DOWN, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN—but as we saw, continuing DOWN leads to collision with body at (3,4).

So the options are LEFT and RIGHT. Let's explore both.

Option 1: Move LEFT to (2,3), then figure out a way down to (3,2). But wait, after moving LEFT, the new head is at (2,3). Then, for the next move, we can't reverse direction—meaning if we go LEFT again, that's allowed since it's not reversing. Wait no: the movement rules say you can't reverse direction, but from DOWN to any other direction except UP is okay on first step.

Wait, initial direction is DOWN. So the next move can be LEFT or RIGHT, as those aren't reverses of DOWN. Once we choose a new direction, subsequent moves must not reverse that.

So let's say we go LEFT to (2,3). Now, from there, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or whatever except UP since previous was LEFT? Wait no: rule 3 says you can't reverse direction on each step. So when you change direction, your next move cannot be the opposite of the current direction.

Wait, for example, if I'm moving DOWN and then turn LEFT, from that point, my next moves can't be RIGHT because that would be reversing the previous direction (LEFT). Wait no—rule 3 says you can't reverse on each step. So each time you change direction, the new direction can't be the opposite of the last one.

Wait, the exact rule is: "The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If the direction is 'NONE', any move is allowed."

So, from a current direction D, the next direction can't be the opposite. So, for example:

- If current is DOWN, next can't be UP.

But when you make a turn to LEFT or RIGHT from DOWN, then next moves can't reverse that new direction.

Wait no—the rule applies to each step. Each time you change direction, the new direction can't be the exact opposite of the previous one. So:

- Suppose current direction is D (e.g., DOWN). Next move can be any except the opposite (UP).

But after moving LEFT from D, the next direction can't be RIGHT, because that's the opposite of LEFT.

Wait no—each change in direction is subject to not being the exact opposite of the previous. So:

- Starting at DOWN: next move can be LEFT or RIGHT, but not UP.

After moving LEFT (new direction is LEFT), the next move can't be RIGHT.

So, if we take the path of moving LEFT first, then from there, we have to plan accordingly.

Let me try to model this step by step.

Initial state:

- Head: (3,3)
- Direction: DOWN
- Body: [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]
- Apple at (3,2)

First move options: LEFT or RIGHT.

Option 1: Move LEFT to (2,3). New direction is LEFT. Now, body updates as follows:

After moving, the head becomes (2,3), and the body shifts. The old head (3,3) becomes part of the body. So the new body list would be [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]. Wait no—when you move, the head moves, then each body part follows.

Wait, more accurately:

When the snake moves, the new head is added to the front of the body list, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten. But in this case, we are moving towards the apple but haven't eaten it yet.

So after first move LEFT, the new head is (2,3). The old positions (including the head) are now part of the body.

Wait no—the body list given is from the head to the tail, excluding the head. So when the head moves, the previous head becomes part of the body.

But perhaps it's better to think about the snake as a sequence: [head, ... , tail]. Each move adds a new head and removes the tail unless apple is eaten.

In this case, after moving LEFT, the body would be:

[(2,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]?

Wait no—that's not accurate. The body list given is [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)], which are the segments behind the head.

When you move LEFT, the new head is at (2,3). So the new body list becomes [ (2,3) added to front? Or wait: when moving, each segment follows the one in front. So perhaps after moving, the new head is at (2,3), and the previous positions shift.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

The initial body is a list of segments behind the head. The head is at (3,3). The body starts from the segment right after the head down to the tail. So when moving, the new head is added, and the last segment is removed unless an apple is eaten.

But since in this case, we're not eating an apple yet, so each move would remove the tail.

So for example:

Initial state: body is [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)].

After moving LEFT from (3,3) to (2,3), the new head is at (2,3). The body now becomes [(2,3), 5,8 etc. ] but that's not correct because each segment follows the one in front.

Wait no—the body segments follow the path of the snake's movement. So when you move LEFT, the previous head (3,3) becomes part of the body at position (3,3). The next segment would be (5,8), etc., but that seems incorrect because it's not following the movement direction.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the snake's body as a list where each new head is added to the front, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So after moving LEFT:

New head: (2,3)

Body becomes [ (2,3) ] + previous body except last segment? Or does it include all segments except the tail?

Wait no. The initial body list is [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. These are the segments after the head.

When moving to (2,3), the new head is added, and the tail (3,4) is removed because no apple was eaten yet. So new body list would be [(2,3)] + all previous body except last? Or wait: the body list represents the entire snake's body excluding the head.

Wait in the initial state, the snake's body is:

Head at (3,3), then the next segments are (5,8) [wait that doesn't make sense because from (3,3), moving down would go to (3,4), not (5,8). There must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, this is where I'm getting stuck. The body list given is [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. That suggests that the snake is a vertical line starting from (5,8) down to (3,4). But how does the head at (3,3) connect? Because after moving down, the body should be under it.

Wait perhaps I've misinterpreted the body list. The body list may represent all segments behind the head, so in this case, the snake is a straight line from (3,8) to (3,4), with the head at (3,3). That makes more sense because then moving DOWN from (3,3) would take it to (3,4), which is already part of the body—so that's why you can't move DOWN initially.

So initial setup:

Head: (3,3)

Body segments: [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]

Wait, but from (3,3) moving down to (3,4), which is part of the body—so that's a collision.

Therefore, initial direction is DOWN, so first move can't be UP. Possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

So, moving LEFT: new head at (2,3). Now, I need to plan a path from (2,3) to (3,2), avoiding collisions with the body.

But wait, after moving LEFT, the snake's body will include (2,3) as the new head, and the old head (3,3) becomes part of the body. So the body list now includes (2,3) followed by all previous body segments except the last one? Or does it add (2,3) to the front?

I think each move adds a new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So after moving LEFT:

New head: (2,3)

Body becomes [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) ]

Wait no—because when you move, the previous body segments shift. So the new head is added to the front of the body list, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

But in this case, since we're not eating an apple yet, the tail would be removed. Wait no—the body list given initially includes 7 segments (excluding head). After moving LEFT, the new body will have those 7 segments plus the old head, but wait that doesn't make sense because each move adds one to the front and removes one from the end.

Wait, I think I need to model it step by step.

Initial state:

Head: (3,3)

Body list: [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]

So the snake is a line from (5,8) down to (3,4), then the head is at (3,3). That makes sense.

When moving LEFT:

New head: (2,3)

The previous body segments are [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. The old head was (3,3). So after moving, the new body is:

[(2,3)] + [all previous body except last segment] because no apple was eaten. Wait that can't be right.

Wait actually, each move adds a new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So initial length of body: 7 segments (excluding head).

After moving LEFT, the new head is at (2,3), so the new body list becomes:

[ (2,3) ] + [5,8,4,8,... up to (3,5)] and then remove the last segment.

Wait no—that's not correct. The movement causes all segments to shift forward by one. So each segment moves to where the previous one was.

So when you move LEFT from (3,3) to (2,3), each body segment follows:

- (5,8) would move to (4,8)
- (4,8) to (3,8)
- (3,8) to (2,8)
Wait that can't be right because the direction was LEFT from (3,3), which is a horizontal move.

But wait, in reality, each segment follows the path of the segment in front. So the movement affects all segments.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps it's better to think about how moving changes the body list.

When you move LEFT:

- New head: (2,3)
- Each body segment moves to where the previous one was.
- The last segment is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So initial body after moving would be:

[ (2,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ]

But wait that doesn't make sense because the direction was LEFT. The segments should follow in a way consistent with the movement.

Alternatively, perhaps the body list is ordered from head to tail. So when moving LEFT, the new head is added at the front, and the last segment is removed.

Wait I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think that after each move, the head moves, and all body segments follow the path of the previous head.

So for example:

Initial position: Head at (3,3), body segments [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)].

After moving LEFT to (2,3):

- The new head is at (2,3).
- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous one:
  - (5,8) → where was the previous (4,8)? No, that's not right.
  
Wait this is confusing. Maybe I should consider that each body segment follows the direction of movement.

Alternatively, perhaps the body list represents the segments in order from the head towards the tail. So when moving LEFT, all segments will adjust accordingly.

But perhaps it's better to accept that after the first move LEFT, the new body includes (2,3) and shifts all previous segments left by one, except for those at x=3, which would stay the same y-wise but decrease x.

Wait this is too time-consuming. Let me try a different approach.

I need to find a path from (3,3) to (3,2) without colliding with any body segments after each move.

Given that initial direction is DOWN, and first move can't be DOWN because it would collide with (3,4). So possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

Option 1: Move LEFT to (2,3), then find a way down to (3,2) without hitting the body.

But after moving LEFT, the body will now include (2,3), and previous positions including (3,3).

Wait no—when you move from (3,3) to (2,3), the new head is at (2,3). The old head (3,3) becomes part of the body. So the new body list would be [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)].

But that's 8 segments plus head, which is longer than before. Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail should be removed to maintain length.

Wait no—the snake's length remains the same unless it eats an apple. So if initial body had 7 segments (excluding head), after moving, it still has 7 segments, but now starting from (2,3).

So the new body would be [(2,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5)].

Wait no—that doesn't make sense because moving LEFT should cause all segments to move in that direction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the body list is updated by adding the new head at the front and removing the last segment unless an apple is eaten.

So initial body: [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ]

After moving LEFT:

New head: (2,3)

Body becomes [ (2,3), 5,8,4,8,3,8,3,7,3,6,3,5 ] but that's longer than before.

Wait no—since the snake's length is fixed unless it eats an apple. So after moving LEFT without eating an apple, the body remains the same length (7 segments). Therefore, the new body would be:

[ (2,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ]

Because we added the new head at (2,3) and removed the last segment (3,4).

So now, after moving LEFT once:

Head: (2,3)

Body: [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5)]

Now, from (2,3), I need to plan a path down to (3,2).

But the current body includes (5,8) down to (3,5). So any collision with these positions is bad.

Possible moves from (2,3):

Since we came from LEFT direction, the new direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT because that's the opposite of LEFT.

Wait no—after moving LEFT once, the current direction is LEFT. The next move can't be RIGHT.

So possible directions: DOWN or UP? Wait, can you change direction at will?

Yes, except for changing to the opposite direction immediately after.

From LEFT direction, next can't be RIGHT, but can be DOWN or UP.

Wait no—the rule is that you can't change to the exact opposite direction of your current movement. So if moving LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT; but can turn into any other direction, like DOWN or UP.

But in this case, after moving LEFT from (3,3) to (2,3), the snake's head is at (2,3). The body is now [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5)].

From (2,3), possible moves are:

- DOWN: to (2,4)
- UP: to (2,2)
- LEFT: can't because it's the same direction and would require another move; but perhaps allowed. Or does each move have to change direction? No, you can continue moving in the same direction.

But wait, after moving LEFT once, the next move could be LEFT again.

Wait no—if you're moving LEFT, your current direction is LEFT. The only restriction is that you can't change direction to RIGHT immediately. You can continue in the same direction or turn into another non-opposite direction.

So from (2,3), possible moves are:

- DOWN: to (2,4)
- UP: to (2,2)
- LEFT: to (1,3) [but that's not helpful for getting to (3,2)]

But moving LEFT again might not be useful because we're trying to get down towards the apple.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better. Let me see:

After moving LEFT to (2,3), then moving DOWN to (2,4):

New head: (2,4)

Body becomes [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (2,3)] but wait no—each move adds the new head and removes the tail.

Wait after moving LEFT, body is [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ]

Then moving DOWN from (2,3):

New head: (2,4)

Body becomes [(2,4)] + previous body except last segment.

So new body: [ (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6) ]

Because we added (2,4) and removed the last segment (3,5).

Now, from (2,4), can I move towards the apple at (3,2)?

Possible directions: current direction is DOWN. Next moves can't be UP.

So possible moves:

- LEFT to (1,4)
- RIGHT to (3,4) [but that's part of the body]
- DOWN to (2,5)

But moving RIGHT to (3,4) would collide with the body at (3,8), but wait no—the body is [(2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6)].

So (3,4) isn't part of the body yet. Wait no—body includes up to (3,6). So moving to (3,4) would be safe? Because body is from (2,4) down to (3,6).

Wait (3,4) is not in the body.

So from (2,4), moving RIGHT to (3,4):

New head: (3,4)

Body becomes [(3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7)]

Because we added (3,4) and removed the last segment (3,6).

Now, from (3,4), I can move DOWN towards (3,2):

Possible moves:

- DOWN: to (3,5) [but that's in the body? Let's check.

Body is [(3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7)]

So no, (3,5) isn't part of the body. Wait, after adding (3,4), the body includes positions up to (3,7). So moving DOWN from (3,4):

Move to (3,5).

But then new head is (3,5), and body becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)]

Wait that seems off.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Start at (3,3) facing DOWN. Can't go DOWN because it hits body at (3,4). So move LEFT to (2,3).

Now direction is LEFT.

2. From (2,3), can move DOWN, UP, or continue LEFT.

If I move DOWN to (2,4):

Body becomes [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (2,3)] → wait no, after moving DOWN from (2,3), body is updated by adding (2,4) and removing the last segment.

Wait initial body after step 1: [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ]?

No, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

After moving LEFT to (2,3):

- Head is at (2,3)
- Body segments are now [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ] plus the new head at (2,3). Wait no—the body list should be updated by adding the new head and removing the last segment.

Wait initial body before move: 7 segments. After moving, it's still 7 segments:

New body after LEFT move: [ (2,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ]

So the last segment is now (3,5).

Now, from (2,3), moving DOWN to (2,4):

New head: (2,4)

Body becomes [ (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ] → wait no, because we add the new head and remove the last segment. So:

New body: [ (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6) ]

Because we added (2,4) at front and removed (3,5).

Now, from (2,4), can I move RIGHT to (3,4)?

Yes, because that position isn't in the body.

After moving RIGHT:

New head: (3,4)

Body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7) ]

Now, from (3,4), move DOWN to (3,5):

But wait, is (3,5) part of the body? Current body after moving RIGHT:

[ (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7) ]

So (3,5) isn't in the body. So move DOWN to (3,5).

Body becomes [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) ]

Now, from (3,5), move DOWN to (3,6):

Is (3,6) in the body? Current body: [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) ].

No, so move DOWN.

New head: (3,6)

Body becomes [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8) ]

Now, from (3,6), move DOWN to (3,7):

Is (3,7) in the body? Current body: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8) ].

No, so move DOWN.

New head: (3,7)

Body becomes [ (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (5,8) ]

Now, from (3,7), move DOWN to (3,8):

Is (3,8) in the body? Current body: [ (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (5,8) ].

Yes! (3,8) is the 5th segment in the body. So moving DOWN from (3,7) would result in collision with itself at (3,8).

That's bad. So that path doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe after reaching (3,6), instead of going further down, I should turn direction.

From (3,6):

- Can move LEFT to (2,6), but body includes (5,8) which is far away.
- Or move RIGHT to (4,6), which is safe.

But wait, the apple is at (3,2). So going further down isn't helpful. Maybe I should try another path.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP from (3,4).

From (3,4):

- Move UP to (3,3): but that's where we started and might be part of the body.
- Let me check: current body after moving RIGHT was [ (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7) ].

So (3,3) isn't in the body. So from (3,4), move UP to (3,3):

New head: (3,3)

Body becomes [ (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) ]

Now, can I go DOWN towards the apple?

From (3,3), direction is UP, so next move can't be DOWN? Wait no—the current direction after moving UP would now be UP. So next moves can't be DOWN.

Wait, no—each time you change direction, you have to consider the new direction and avoid the opposite.

If I'm at (3,4) facing RIGHT, then move UP: new direction is UP. Next move can't be DOWN.

But wait, that might not make sense. Let me clarify:

Each movement changes the direction, except when continuing straight.

Wait no—direction is determined by the previous move. So if you're moving RIGHT and decide to move UP, your current direction becomes UP, so next move can't be DOWN.

In this case, after moving UP from (3,4) to (3,3), current direction is UP. So next moves can't be DOWN.

But we want to get to (3,2), which is DOWN from (3,3). So that's blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have moved UP but instead turned another way.

From (3,4), instead of moving UP or RIGHT again, maybe move LEFT back towards (2,4).

Wait no—it's getting too convoluted. Maybe the initial path wasn't the best.

Alternative approach: Instead of moving LEFT first, try moving RIGHT.

Starting at (3,3):

1. Can't move DOWN, so move RIGHT to (4,3).

Now direction is RIGHT.

Body after move: [ (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ]

Wait no—the body should now be:

After moving RIGHT from (3,3), the new head is at (4,3). The previous body was [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) ].

So new body becomes [ (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6) ]

Because we added (4,3) and removed the last segment (3,5).

Now from (4,3), facing RIGHT. Next move can be DOWN, UP, or continue RIGHT.

If I move RIGHT again to (5,3):

New head: (5,3)

Body becomes [ (5,3), (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7) ]

But that seems away from the apple. Maybe better to go DOWN.

From (4,3), move DOWN to (4,4):

Is (4,4) in the body? Current body: [ (5,3), (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7) ]

No. So new head at (4,4).

Body becomes [ (4,4), (5,3), (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) ]

Now from (4,4), can move DOWN to (4,5):

Is (4,5) in body? Current body: [ (4,4), (5,3), (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) ]

No. So move DOWN.

New head at (4,5).

Body becomes [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,3), (4,3), (5,8), (4,8) ]

Continuing this way seems tedious and may not reach the apple without collision.

Perhaps another strategy: After moving RIGHT to (4,3), move DOWN multiple times:

From (4,3):

1. Move DOWN to (4,4)
2. Move DOWN to (4,5)
3. Move DOWN to (4,6) – check if in body
   Current body after step 2: [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,3), (4,3), (5,8), (4,8) ]
   So (4,6) isn't in the body.

Continue until reach (4,7):

After several moves DOWN, head is at (4,7). Body now includes up to (4, something).

But this seems inefficient. Maybe there's a better path.

Wait, maybe from (4,3), move LEFT back towards the apple.

From (4,3), direction is RIGHT. So next move can't be LEFT because that would be opposite of current direction? Or no—current direction after moving RIGHT is now facing RIGHT, so turning LEFT would change direction to LEFT, which is allowed except for immediate opposite.

Wait no—the rule is you can't reverse direction immediately. For example, if you're going RIGHT and decide to turn LEFT (which would face DOWN or UP?), I'm getting confused.

Actually, in snake games, when you change direction, you can't make a 180-degree turn. So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT; you can go UP or DOWN.

So from (4,3), facing RIGHT: next moves can be UP or DOWN.

If I move UP to (4,2):

Is (4,2) in the body? Current body after moving RIGHT is [ (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6) ]

Wait no—after first move RIGHT, body was updated to [ (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6) ].

So moving UP from (4,3):

New head at (4,2).

Body becomes [ (4,2), (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7) ]

Now, from (4,2), facing UP. Next move can't be DOWN.

But the apple is at (3,2). So if I could move LEFT from (4,2), but since I'm facing UP, turning LEFT would face LEFT direction, which is allowed as it's not opposite of UP.

So:

From (4,2):

1. Turn LEFT to face LEFT.
2. Move LEFT to (3,2) – that's the apple!

But wait, can we do that without collision?

After moving LEFT from (4,2), new head at (3,2). Check body: [ (4,2), (4,3), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7) ].

(3,2) isn't in the body. So yes! That works.

So the path is:

1. Start at (3,3). Can't go DOWN, so move RIGHT to (4,3).
2. From (4,3), facing RIGHT, turn UP.
3. Move UP to (4,2).
4. Turn LEFT to face LEFT.
5. Move LEFT to (3,2) – eaten apple.

Thus, the snake can reach the apple without colliding with itself by moving RIGHT, then UP, then LEFT into the apple's position.
</think>

The snake successfully navigates to the apple by making a strategic turn after moving right and up. By turning left from position (4,2), it reaches the apple at (3,2) without self-collision.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake is at (3,3) facing down but cannot move further because the next cell (3,4) is part of its body.

2. **First Move – Right**: The snake turns right to face east and moves to (4,3). This action updates its body segments, removing the tail at (3,5).

3. **Second Move – Up**: From (4,3), facing east, the snake turns up to face north and moves to (4,2). This move is safe as (4,2) isn't part of its current body.

4. **Third Move – Left**: Upon reaching (4,2), the snake turns left to face west. Moving left takes it to (3,2), where the apple is located. Since (3,2) isn't in the body, it eats the apple without collision.

**Final Answer**:  
The snake can eat the apple by moving right, up, and then left into its position. The sequence of moves ensures no self-collision occurs.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 3) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)], to eat the apple at (3, 2).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
