========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to move the snake from (8,3) to eat the apple at (2,2). Let me break it down step by step.

First, the head is at (8,3), and the current direction is "DOWN". The body cells are [(8,4)], so the snake's length is 2. The apple is at (2,2), which is quite a distance away diagonally up-left from the head.

The movement rules say I can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is DOWN, I can't go UP next. So my first move has to be either LEFT or RIGHT or stay in some other valid direction, but since the current direction is DOWN, the allowed moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN? Wait, no—the rules say you can't reverse, so if moving DOWN now, next move cannot be UP. But you can change direction as long as it's not reversing.

Wait, the movement rules specify that you can't reverse. So for example, if current is "UP", you can't go "DOWN" next. Similarly, LEFT and RIGHT are reverses of each other. If current is NONE (which isn't our case here), any move is allowed.

So in this scenario, the current direction is DOWN, so the next move cannot be UP. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue going DOWN.

Let me visualize the grid. The snake's head is at (8,3). The body is behind it at (8,4), which means the tail is moving towards (8,5) if we don't eat an apple. Wait no—the body list is [(8,4)], so the current state is head at (8,3), then body at (8,4). So the snake is two segments long.

The apple is at (2,2), which is much to the left and up a bit. The Manhattan distance from (8,3) to (2,2) is |8-2| + |3-2| = 6+1=7 steps. But considering the snake's movement constraints, I need to plan a path that avoids collisions with the body and walls.

First move: starting at (8,3), direction is DOWN. So possible moves next are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN? Wait no—current direction is DOWN. According to the rules, you can't reverse direction on the first move. Since current is DOWN, I can't go UP. But what about other directions?

Wait, the initial state's direction is "DOWN", so the first move can be any except UP because it's a reversal? Wait no: the movement rules say that you cannot reverse, meaning if your current direction is DOWN, next can't be UP; similarly, LEFT can't go RIGHT. So for the first move, from DOWN, I can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue going DOWN.

But let me think about each option:

1. Move DOWN: New head would be (8,2). But wait, the body is at (8,4), so after moving DOWN, the new head is (8,2). Then we check for collisions. The new_head needs to not coincide with any BODYi except possibly the tail's current cell if it's about to move.

Wait, but in this case, after moving, the body list becomes [(8,3)] as old head, then check if new_head is (8,2). So the body cells would be [old head], which is (8,3), and then the tail was at (8,4). Since we're not eating an apple here, the tail will move. Wait no—the movement rules say that after moving, if we eat the apple, we don't remove the tail; else, we do.

So in this case, since new_head is (8,2), which isn't the apple's position, we proceed to update the body: insert old head at front (BODY becomes [(8,3)] and then remove the tail (which was (8,4)), so the new body list is [(8,3)], but that can't be right because the snake has two segments. Wait no—initially, the snake's head is (8,3) and body is [(8,4)]. So when moving normally, after inserting the old head, the body becomes [old_head] + current_body = [(8,3), (8,4)], then remove the tail if not eating apple. But since new_head is (8,2), which isn't apple's position, we do remove the tail. So the new body would be [(8,3)] and head at (8,2). Wait that can't be right because the snake's length was 2; after moving, it should become 2 again by removing the tail.

Wait no: initial state is S = [head (8,3), body1 (8,4)]. When moving normally:

- new_head is computed.
- If no collision and within bounds:
   a. Insert old head into body list → body becomes [(8,3), (8,4)].
   b. Since not eating apple, remove tail → body becomes [(8,3)].

So the new S would be [new_head (8,2), (8,3)], which is valid because each segment is adjacent.

But wait, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2)—is that allowed? Because the direction is DOWN. Yes, since current direction is DOWN, next move can't be UP but can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

So after moving DOWN, new head at (8,2), body at [(8,3)], which is adjacent.

But I need to check for collisions: the new_head must not coincide with any BODYi except when it's the tail's current cell. So in this case, the new_head is (8,2), and the body after moving would be [(8,3)]. So no collision because (8,2) isn't in the body.

But wait—the body before movement includes (8,4). After moving, the body becomes [old head (8,3)] as it's inserted at front, then remove tail which was (8,4), so new body is [(8,3)], and new_head is (8,2).

So that seems safe.

But let me think about other options. Maybe moving LEFT first could be better because the apple is to the left.

If I move LEFT from (8,3) in the current direction DOWN? Wait no—the initial direction is DOWN, so if I choose a new direction, it can't reverse. So choosing LEFT or RIGHT is possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me outline possible paths.

Option 1: Move directly towards the apple by going LEFT multiple times until reaching column 2, then move up to row 2.

But wait, moving from (8,3) to (7,3), then (6,3), etc., but the body is in (8,4). So I need to make sure that when moving left, the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to first move up or down to create space and then proceed.

Wait, let me think about the coordinates. The apple is at (2,2), which is much higher up and to the left. So from (8,3), I need to go left 6 times (to x=2) and up once (from y=3 to y=2).

But since each move can only change one coordinate at a time, the path needs to consist of 6 LEFT moves and 1 UP move, but in what order?

Wait no—Manhattan distance is 7, so I need exactly 6 lefts and 1 up. But movement can be interleaved as long as the net result is that.

But the issue is the snake's body could block certain paths. So perhaps it's better to first move upwards a bit to avoid getting stuck by the body.

Wait, let me check: current direction is DOWN, so initial possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If I choose to move DOWN first (to (8,2)), then next move could be LEFT towards x=2. But after moving down, the body becomes [(8,3)], which is adjacent to the new head at (8,2). So that's safe.

But let me plan a path:

1. Move DOWN: (8,2)
   - Body becomes [(8,3)].
   - Check for apple? No, since it's at (2,2), so no eating.

2. Then move LEFT repeatedly towards x=2:
   - From (8,2) to (7,2), then 6 more lefts to reach (2,2).

But wait, each time I move LEFT, the body will shift accordingly. So after moving down once, then moving left:

- After first LEFT: new head is (7,2). Body becomes [(8,2)] and remove tail (which was (8,3) but only if not eating apple. Wait no—the initial movement to (8,2) didn't eat the apple, so body is [(8,3)], then moving left to (7,2):

   - New head: (7,2)
   - Insert old head (8,2) into body → [ (8,2), (8,3) ]
   - Remove tail because not eating → new body is [ (8,2) ]

So the snake's length remains 2.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because after moving down to (8,2), the body was [(8,3)], and then moving left adds (8,2) as the first body segment, but then removes the tail which was (8,3). So the new body is [(8,2)].

Wait no—the initial body after moving down to (8,2) would be [ (8,3) ] because we inserted the old head and then removed the tail. Then when moving left, we insert (8,2), so the body becomes [ (8,2), (8,3) ], but since we're not eating apple, we remove the tail which is (8,3). So new body is [ (8,2) ].

So after each move, the snake's length remains 2: head and one body segment.

But if I keep moving left, each time the head moves left, the body shifts as well. Let me see:

After first LEFT:
- Head: (7,2)
- Body: [ (8,2) ]
Wait no—when moving from (8,3) to (8,2), then the next move is LEFT, which brings us to (7,2). The body after that would be [ (8,2) ].

But then the next move is another LEFT to (6,2), and so on. Each time, the body is just the previous head position. So as I move left six times from x=8 to x=2, each step adds a new head at (7,2), (6,2), etc., with the body being the previous position.

This seems okay because after each move, the body only has one segment behind the head, so no collision.

Once I reach x=2, then I need to move up once to y=2. But wait, current y is 2 at that point.

Wait no: initial y was 3, then moved down to y=2, so now we're at (8,2), but after moving left multiple times, we'd be at (2,2). Then perhaps I don't need to move up anymore because y is already 2.

Wait the apple is at (2,2), which is same x and y as our target. So if I can get from (8,3) down to (8,2), then left 6 times to (2,2), that would reach the apple.

But wait, moving left from (8,2) six times would take us through (7,2), (6,2), ..., (2,2). So after each move, we check if new_head is at (2,2). At that point, we eat the apple. Then what happens?

When new_head is (2,2):

- Since it's the apple's position, we don't remove the tail. So body becomes [ (8,3), (7,2), ..., (3,2) ]? Wait no.

Wait let me retrace:

After moving down to (8,2), then move left to (7,2):

- Body after inserting old head is [(8,2), (8,3)], but since not eating apple, remove tail → body becomes [ (8,2) ]

Then next move: from (7,2) to (6,2). Insert old head (7,2) into body → body becomes [ (7,2), (8,2) ], then remove tail (which was 8,2?) Wait no—the tail is the last element of the body. So after inserting, it's [ (7,2), (8,2) ]. Then we remove the tail, so new body is [ (7,2) ].

Wait this seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that each time you move, the body grows by one segment only if you're not eating an apple. Wait no—the rule is that when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail; otherwise, you do.

But in our case, unless we reach (2,2), which has the apple, all other moves result in removing the tail. So moving from (8,3) down to (8,2), then left six times:

Each move to the left adds a new head and removes the tail, so each time the body is just one segment behind.

So after moving left once: body is [ (8,2) ]

After moving left again: body is [ (7,2) ]

Wait no—after inserting old head into body, which was empty? Or perhaps not. Let me clarify:

Initial state:
- Head: (8,3)
- Body: [(8,4)]

Move 1: DOWN to (8,2). Since it's a normal move (not eating apple):
   - Insert old head (8,3) into body → body becomes [ (8,3), (8,4) ]
   - Remove tail because not eating → new body is [ (8,3) ]

So after Move 1:
- Head: (8,2)
- Body: [(8,3)]

Move 2: LEFT to (7,2). Since not eating apple:
   - Insert old head (8,2) into body → body becomes [ (8,2), (8,3) ]
   - Remove tail → new body is [ (8,2) ]

So after Move 2:
- Head: (7,2)
- Body: [(8,2)]

Move 3: LEFT to (6,2):
   - Insert old head (7,2) into body → body becomes [ (7,2), (8,2) ]
   - Remove tail → new body is [ (7,2) ]

And so on.

So each left move after the first just shifts the body by one segment to follow.

After six LEFT moves from x=8 to x=2:

- Head: (2,2)
- Body: [(3,2)]

Because each time we move left, the body was the previous head position. So after moving to (3,2), the body is [4,2], but wait that can't be right.

Wait no—after moving from (8,2) down to (8,2), then left six times:

Each step: x decreases by 1, y remains at 2.

After Move 1: x=8,y=2; body=[(8,3)] → wait no, earlier analysis said after first move DOWN, head is (8,2), body is [ (8,3) ]

Then Move 2: LEFT to (7,2); insert old head (8,2) into body → [ (8,2), (8,3) ]; then remove tail → [ (8,2) ]

So now, after two moves:
- Head: (7,2)
- Body: [(8,2)]

Move 3: LEFT to (6,2):
   - Insert old head (7,2) → body becomes [ (7,2), (8,2) ]
   - Remove tail → new body is [ (7,2) ]

So after three moves:
- Head: (6,2)
- Body: [(7,2)]

Similarly:

Move 4: LEFT to (5,2):
   - Insert old head (6,2) → body becomes [ (6,2), (7,2) ]
   - Remove tail → [ (6,2) ]

After four moves:
- Head: (5,2)
- Body: [(6,2)]

Move 5: LEFT to (4,2):
   - Insert old head (5,2) → body becomes [ (5,2), (6,2) ]
   - Remove tail → [ (5,2) ]

After five moves:
- Head: (4,2)
- Body: [(5,2)]

Move 6: LEFT to (3,2):
   - Insert old head (4,2) → body becomes [ (4,2), (5,2) ]
   - Remove tail → [ (4,2) ]

After six moves:
- Head: (3,2)
- Body: [(4,2)]

Move 7: LEFT to (2,2):
   - Now, new_head is at apple's position. So we don't remove the tail.
   - Insert old head (3,2) → body becomes [ (3,2), (4,2) ]
   - Since eating apple, keep the tail; so new body is [ (3,2), (4,2) ]

So after seven moves:
- Head: (2,2)
- Body: [(3,2), (4,2)]

Wait, but initial direction was DOWN. The first move was DOWN, then six LEFT moves.

But wait, the path would require moving down once, then left six times—so total of 7 moves to reach (2,2). But I need to check if at any point the new head collides with body segments except possibly the tail's current position.

Looking back:

After Move 1: head (8,2), body [(8,3)] → safe.
Move 2: head (7,2), body [(8,2)] → safe.
Move 3: head (6,2), body [(7,2)] → safe.
And so on until move 6: head (3,2), body [(4,2)].
Move 7: head (2,2), which is apple. No collision because the body is [ (3,2), (4,2) ].

Wait no—when we are at move 7, the body after inserting old head would be [ (3,2), (4,2), ...] but wait no—the process is:

When moving to (2,2):

- Insert old head (3,2) into body → new body becomes [ (3,2), (4,2) ]
- Since we ate the apple at (2,2), we don't remove any tail.

So body remains as [ (3,2), (4,2) ] plus the inserted segment?

Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify:

When you eat the apple (i.e., new_head is at apple's position):

- You do not remove the tail.
- The body grows by one segment.

So after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by one. So from move 6 to move 7:

Move 6:
- Head: (3,2)
- Body: [(4,2)]

Move 7:
- Move LEFT to (2,2). Since it's apple position:
   - Insert old head (3,2) → body becomes [ (3,2), (4,2) ]
   - Do not remove tail. So final body is [ (3,2), (4,2) ]

So after eating, the snake's body includes all previous segments plus the new one.

Thus, no collision occurs because when moving to (2,2), the body is [ (3,2), (4,2) ], and the head is at (2,2). So they don't overlap except possibly with themselves?

Wait, but the head was previously at (3,2), which is now part of the body. When we move to (2,2), the head is new, so no collision.

Yes, because the body after inserting old head would be [ (3,2), (4,2) ], and the head is at (2,2). So no overlap except maybe if any segment was at (2,2), but since we just moved there from (3,2), which was not part of the body yet.

Thus, this path seems safe. Therefore, moving down once then left six times would reach the apple without collision.

Alternatively, another approach could be to move directly left seven times and then down once, but that might result in a longer path or potential collision if not done carefully.

But based on the initial plan, moving down then lefts seems feasible.

So the steps are:

1. Move DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2).
2. Move LEFT six times: from (8,2) → (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2).

At each step, ensure no collision with body.

Thus, the answer is to move DOWN and then LEFT six times.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to the position of an apple on a grid. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. The goal is to determine the sequence of moves that will allow the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its own body.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake starts at position (8,3) on a grid and needs to move to the apple located at (2,2). The snake can only move one cell in any direction per move, and it cannot collide with its own body except for the last segment when growing after eating the apple.

2. **Intuition**: To reach the apple efficiently, we can break down the movement into two parts:
   - First, move the snake downward to align it vertically towards the apple.
   - Then, move the snake leftward six times to reach the target position horizontally.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Move the snake DOWN once from (8,3) to (8,2).
   - Subsequently, move the snake LEFT six times: from (8,2) through (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), and finally to (2,2).

### Solution Code
```python
# Initialize the snake's position
head = (8, 3)
body = [(8, 4)]  # Tail is at (8,4)

# Move down once
head = (8, 2)
body = [head] + body[:-1]

# Now move left six times to reach (2,2)
for _ in range(6):
    head = (head[0] - 1, head[1])
    body.insert(0, head)

print("Snake reached the apple at position", head)
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The snake starts with its head at (8,3) and tail at (8,4).
- **First Move**: Moving down from (8,3) to (8,2) adjusts the head position. The body follows, excluding the last segment to avoid growth unless an apple is eaten.
- **Subsequent Moves**: Moving left six times shifts the head towards (2,2). Each move updates the head's position and inserts it at the front of the body list, effectively moving the snake without collision.

This approach ensures that the snake efficiently navigates to the apple by first aligning vertically and then moving horizontally, avoiding any self-collision.
