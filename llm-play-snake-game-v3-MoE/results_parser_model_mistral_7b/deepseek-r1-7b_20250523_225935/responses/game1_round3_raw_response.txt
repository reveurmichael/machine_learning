========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out a path for the snake starting at (5,5) to reach the apple at (7,0) without colliding with itself. The snake's current direction is "NONE," meaning it can choose any initial direction.

First, let me consider the movement rules and constraints:

1. **Direction Constraints**: The first move cannot be a reversal. So if I start moving RIGHT, the next move can't be DOWN or LEFT unless it's after eating food, which in this case isn't applicable yet because we're starting to move towards the apple.

2. **Path Planning Heuristic**: Since Manhattan distance is 7 (x) and 5 (y), the net moves required are 2 RIGHT and 5 DOWN minus something? Wait, actually, from (5,5) to (7,0):

- x increases by 2: so need more RIGHT than LEFT.
- y decreases by 5: so need more DOWN than UP.

The exact difference is:
- Right - Left = 7 - 5 = +2
- Up - Down = 0 - 5 = -5

So, in terms of moves, we need to have two more Rights than Lefts and five more Downs than Ups. But since the snake starts at (5,5), moving towards higher x and lower y.

3. **Avoiding Collisions**: Each move must ensure that the new head position is not outside the grid or overlapping with any body cells except when growing after eating food.

4. **Body Continuity**: The snake's body must remain a continuous line of adjacent segments after each move.

5. **Immediate Trapping**: After eating the apple, there needs to be at least one legal move next turn.

Now, considering the starting position (5,5), I should plan a path that moves Right and Down as much as possible without hitting any walls or itself.

Let me sketch a potential path:

1. Move RIGHT twice to get closer in x-direction:
   - From (5,5) → (6,5) → (7,5)
2. Now, need to turn DOWN to start moving towards lower y:
   - But at each step, check if the new head is safe.

Wait, let's test this:

Step 1: Move RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5). The body becomes [(6,5)]. No collision yet.

Step 2: Move RIGHT again to (7,5). Now the snake is at (7,5), with body [(7,5), (6,5)]. Next step needs to be DOWN or LEFT. If we go DOWN from (7,5):

- New head would be (7,4). Check if it's safe.
- Current body cells are [ (7,5) as new head, then the previous head is (6,5), and tail was at some point before. Wait, in this case, since we just started moving, after two RIGHTs, the snake is [(7,5), (6,5)] with a length of 2.

Wait, initial direction is NONE; first move could be RIGHT twice, but let me think step by step:

After Step 1: Move Right from (5,5) to (6,5). Now S = [ (6,5) as head, tail removed so just [ (6,5) ].

But wait, the initial body is empty because it's a snake of length 1. Wait no—the problem states that the body list includes segments from behind the head up to the tail. So if the snake has no body (empty array), it's like a single cell. Then when moving RIGHT twice:

First move: new_head = (6,5). Since there's no body except the old head, insert (5,5) as the new head and remove any tail? Wait, the initial state is [head] with an empty body list.

Wait, let me clarify. The snake's S is [HEAD, BODY1, ..., BodyN]. The body cells are from behind HEAD to tail, so when the body is empty, the snake is just the head.

So in this case, after moving RIGHT twice:

Move 1: From (5,5) → (6,5). Since there was no body before (empty array), insert old head at front of Body list. But since it's a single cell, the new S becomes [ (6,5) ].

Wait, maybe I need to model this step by step with each move:

Initial state:
- HEAD = (5,5)
- Current direction = NONE
- Body cells = []
- Apple at (7,0)

So first move options: since current direction is NONE, can choose any direction except reversing if it's the first move. But as it's the first move, there's no previous direction to reverse from.

Let me plan:

Option 1: Move RIGHT twice then DOWN steps.

But need to check each step for collision and validity.

First Move:
- Direction = RIGHT
- new_head = (5+1, 5) = (6,5)
- Check collision: boundaries are okay. Since body is empty, no collision.
- Update body: insert old head (5,5) → new_body = [ (5,5) ]
- New head is (6,5). So S becomes [(6,5)]
- Current direction set to RIGHT.

Second Move:
- Direction remains RIGHT
- new_head = (6+1, 5) = (7,5)
- Check collision: boundaries are okay. Body before this move was [ (5,5) ]? Wait no—after first move, body is [ (5,5) ], but since the head moved to (6,5), the new_body after inserting old head (now at position 1 of body list?) Hmm.

Wait, let me correct:

After each move:
- Compute new_head
- If no collision, update body: insert old head at front.
- Then remove tail if not eating apple.

So first step:

Move RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5). Body was empty; after inserting old head (5,5), the new_body is [ (5,5) ]. But since it's moving right, does this make sense? Wait, initial body list is empty, so when we insert the old head at front of an empty list, the new_body becomes [ (5,5) ], which would be behind the new head (6,5). So the snake is now [(6,5), (5,5)].

Wait no—because in the first step, after moving RIGHT:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Insert old head (5,5) at front of body list (which was empty), so body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Since no apple eaten, remove last element. So now body is [ ]

Wait that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state has Body cells as empty because it's just a single cell. After first move:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Insert old head at front: so body becomes [(5,5)]
- Since no apple eaten, remove last element → body is [ ]

So now S = [ (6,5) ]

But that doesn't make sense because the snake's length should be 2? Or maybe when you move without eating, the tail is removed. So if it was a single cell before moving, after moving right and inserting old head at front, then removing the last element would leave body as empty again.

Wait no—when moving:

If current direction is RIGHT, new_head = (6,5). Since the snake's body cells are [] before this move, so we just insert the old head into the front of the body. So after inserting, body becomes [ (5,5) ]. Then since it didn't eat an apple, we remove the last element → body is empty again.

So now S = [ (6,5) ]

Wait that seems to imply that when moving from a single cell snake RIGHT without eating food, you end up back at a single cell. Which makes sense because after inserting and removing, it's still one segment.

But perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body is updated. Alternatively, if the snake is length 1, moving in any direction doesn't change the fact that it remains length 1—because when you move forward without eating, you're just shifting position but not growing or shrinking.

Wait no—if the snake moves RIGHT twice and starts at (5,5), after first move to (6,5):

- New_head = (6,5)
- Insert old head (5,5) → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Since no apple eaten, remove last element → body is empty.

So S now has only the new head. Next move:

Move RIGHT again:

- New_head = (7,5)
- Body before was empty; insert old head (6,5) → body becomes [ (6,5) ]
- No apple eaten, so remove last → body is empty.
  
Now S = [ (7,5) ]

So now the snake's head is at (7,5). Now, need to turn DOWN towards the apple.

Third Move:

Direction is RIGHT again? Or switch to DOWN?

Wait current direction was RIGHT for first two moves. Next move can't be LEFT or DOWN if it was previously RIGHT—because the rule says cannot reverse on next move after initial step. Wait no—the rules say you cannot reverse, but since the previous direction was RIGHT, your next possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (as per "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed.)

So after moving two Rights in a row and it's NONE anymore, the third move can be RIGHT again or switch to another direction.

But let me see: At (7,5), which is higher x than apple but y=5 > 0. So need to go down towards y=0.

If I turn DOWN from (7,5):

- New_head = (7,4)
  
Check if this is safe:

Is it within the grid? Yes.

Is it overlapping with any body cells?

Current snake is [ (7,5) ], so no overlap. So proceed.

After moving, update S:

Insert old head (7,5) → body becomes [ (7,5) ]
Since not eating apple, remove last element → body empty.
New S = [ (7,4) ]

Now at (7,4). Next move: can't go DOWN again because previous was DOWN? Or is it allowed?

Wait no—the current direction after moving DOWN from (7,5) to (7,4):

Previous directions were RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN. So last non-NONE direction was DOWN.

So next possible moves are RIGHT or LEFT if we want to continue in x-direction but since x is already at maximum 10, maybe better to try to move Right again?

Wait no—current x is 7; can only go up to 10. But moving right from (7,4) would take it closer to the apple.

But let's see:

Fourth Move: From (7,4), direction could be RIGHT or DOWN.

If I move RIGHT to (8,4):

- Check collision with body cells? Current S is [ (7,4) ], so no collision.
- Update: insert old head (7,4) → new_body = [ (7,4) ]
- Remove last element if not eating apple. So S becomes [ (8,4) ]

Fifth Move:

From (8,4), direction could be RIGHT or DOWN.

Moving RIGHT to (9,4):

- Check boundaries: x=9 is okay.
- No body overlap as before.

After moving:
- Insert old head at front → new_body = [ (8,4) ]
- Remove last element → S becomes [ (9,4) ]

But wait, this doesn't help us because we're still above y=0 but not approaching x-wise. Wait no—actually, from 5,5 to 7,5 is two Right moves; then turning DOWN.

Wait perhaps a better approach: instead of moving all the way to (7,5), maybe go halfway and turn.

But let's think step by step:

Alternative path:

1. Move RIGHT twice: ends at (7,5)
2. Then move DOWN five times to reach y=0

Let me check each step.

Move 1: RIGHT from (5,5) → (6,5). Body becomes [ (5,5) ], remove last element after not eating apple → S is [(6,5)]

Move 2: RIGHT again → (7,5). Insert old head (6,5) at front of empty body list? Wait no—when moving from a single cell:

Wait initial state for move 1: S = [ (5,5) ], body cells are []. After moving RIGHT:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Insert (5,5) into body → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Remove last element because no apple eaten → body is []
  
So after two rights, it's [(7,5)].

Move 3: DOWN to (7,4). Check if safe. Yes. S = [(7,4)]

Move 4: DOWN to (7,3)

Move 5: DOWN to (7,2)

Move 6: DOWN to (7,1)

Move 7: DOWN to (7,0) → apple is at (7,0). So need to eat the apple.

So in move 7:

- Move from (7,1) to (7,0)
- Now check if this is acceptable:
   - It's on the body cells? If the snake is [ (7,0) ] after moving, because we have to eat the apple.
   
Wait when you eat food, the new head is added to the front of the body list and not removed from the end. So in move 7:

- Move direction must be DOWN
- Compute new_head = (7,1) + DOWN → (7,0)
- Check for collision: snake's body before this move was [(7,1)]? Or is it that the body cells are [ ... previous segments ] up to tail.

Wait after six moves moving DOWN:

Move 3: from (7,5) to (7,4): S becomes [(7,4)]
Move 4: to (7,3)
...
After each move, the snake's head moves down by one. So at Move 6: from (7,2) → (7,1). After moving:

- Insert old head (7,2) into front of body cells [ ... ]? Wait perhaps not—each move appends to the list.

This is getting complicated; maybe it's better to visualize each step with S and body cells.

Alternatively, since in this scenario we're starting from a single cell, moving right twice gets us to (7,5), then down five times would get us to apple at (7,0). Let me map out the steps:

1. Move RIGHT: (5,5) → (6,5)
   - S = [ (6,5) ]
2. Move RIGHT again: (7,5)
   - S = [ (7,5) ]
3. Move DOWN: (7,4)
   - S = [ (7,4) ]
4. Move DOWN: (7,3)
   - S = [ (7,3) ]
5. Move DOWN: (7,2)
   - S = [ (7,2) ]
6. Move DOWN: (7,1)
   - S = [ (7,1) ]
7. Move DOWN: (7,0)

Now at (7,0). After moving, check for apple:

- Since we moved to the apple's location, in step 7:
   - new_head is (7,0), which matches apple position.
   - So after this move, since food was eaten, body list does not have its last element removed.

But wait: When you eat the apple, do you add your old head to the front and keep all previous segments?

Wait per problem statement:

When you eat, the new_head is added at front of Body cells (i.e., becomes new first segment), then since food was eaten, no removal of tail. So in step 7:

- S before move: [ (7,1) ]
- Move DOWN to (7,0)
- Insert old head (7,1) → body becomes [ (7,1) ]
- Since ate apple, do not remove last element
- New S is [(7,0), (7,1)]

Wait no—because after inserting the old head at front of body cells:

The new_body = [old_head] + current_body

So before step 7, body was empty because in move 6: from (7,2) to (7,1). Let's see each move's S and body.

Move 3:
- Direction DOWN
- new_head = (7,4)
- old_head = (7,5) → inserted into front of body cells [ ]? Wait no—body was empty after previous step?

Wait it's getting too tangled. Maybe better to assume that in each move without eating food:

- Insert old head at front and remove last element.

But when eating food, only insert the old head but do not remove tail.

So let me model this for the path:

Move 1: RIGHT
S becomes [(6,5)]
Body cells = []

Move 2: RIGHT
S becomes [(7,5)]
Body cells = []

Move 3: DOWN
new_head = (7,4)
Insert old head (7,5) → body becomes [ (7,5) ]
No apple eaten, remove last element → body is []
S = [(7,4)]

Move 4: DOWN
new_head = (7,3)
Insert (7,4), then since no apple eaten, remove tail. S remains [ (7,3) ]

Move 5: DOWN
Same as above.

After move 6: at (7,1)

Now Move 7: DOWN to (7,0)

- new_head = (7,0)
- Insert old head (7,1) → body becomes [ (7,1) ]
- Since food eaten, do not remove last element
So S is [(7,0), (7,1)]

Wait but now the snake's body cells are [ (7,1) ].

After eating apple:

Check for collision: new_head at (7,0). Is it on any of the body? The current head is followed by a tail segment. So in S = [(7,0), (7,1)], moving down to (7,0):

- Check if (7,0) overlaps with any of the body cells except last element.

Wait no—if you have S as [head] at (7,0) and then (7,1). The body is behind: so when moving towards (7,0), does it collide?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to model each step's body correctly.

But in any case, after eating apple at move 7:

The snake is now [(7,0), (7,1)]. But then next moves need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with previous segments except if growing. So for example, moving RIGHT again from (7,0) would go to (8,0):

- Check boundaries: okay
- Is this position in body? Current S is [(7,0), (7,1)], so only collision check against the entire snake's body.

Wait no—the rules say that new head can't be on any segment of the body except when it's growing. So moving to (8,0) from (7,0):

- Is (8,0) in [ (7,0), (7,1) ]? No.
So move allowed.

But then after moving:

S becomes [(8,0)] as new_head is added at front and no tail removal since not growing. Wait wait—after eating apple, do you grow or just place the new head?

No: when you eat food, your body doesn't shrink; instead, you add another segment in front.

Wait let me re-read problem statement:

"Note that the first move must always be a horizontal movement."

Not directly relevant here. Then, "if you are at position (x,y), and you can move to (x±1,y) or (x,y±1)"—standard movement rules.

"When you eat an apple, your head is moved to the location of the apple. So when you eat, your new head is added at front of Body cells."

So body cells are [ ... , from tail to head? Or not?

Wait problem statement says:

"the Body parts follow behind it as a list of coordinates." And that moving involves adding new_head to front and removing last.

But for eating apple: "your new head is moved, the new head becomes added at the beginning of the body."

So in other words, when you eat an apple, your snake grows by one segment (the new head) but does not lose any tail. So each time after moving, S appends new_head to front.

Wait perhaps it's better to model this step-by-step:

Each move is either horizontal or vertical as per rules; when moving:

- Insert the old head at front of current body cells
- If you don't eat apple: remove last element

When eating apple:

- Insert old head, do not remove tail. So you add one more segment.

So in the case where we moved to (7,0) from (7,1), then after that move when we are at (7,0):

Wait no—each movement step is a single cell change; upon moving into apple's location, it triggers eating of the apple. So perhaps in each move towards the apple:

After moving into the new head position, if that matches any body part except itself? Wait no: snake can't have overlapping segments.

So when we are at (7,1), and move to (7,0) which is apple's location, then after this move, since you ate it, the new_head is added but tail isn't removed. So S becomes:

old_body = [ (7,1) ] → before moving
new_head = (7,0)
inserted at front: body becomes [ (7,0), (7,1) ]

So now after step 7:

S = [(7,0), (7,1)]

Now to get back from there, we need to avoid overlapping. So next moves must ensure that the new head isn't on any previous segment except as per rules.

But moving Right would go to (8,0):

- Check if (8,0) is in [ (7,0), (7,1) ]? No.
So allowed.

Move 8: RIGHT → (8,0). Now S becomes [(8,0), (7,0), (7,1)]

Wait no—each move appends to front. So:

- After step 7: S = [ (7,0), (7,1) ]
- Move RIGHT → new_head is (8,0)
- Insert old_head (7,0) at front of body:
   - new_body becomes [ (7,0), (7,1) ] → but wait that's the same as before. No—old S was [(7,0), (7,1)].
Wait no: when moving to right:

- Move direction is RIGHT
- new_head = (8, 0)
- Insert old_head at front of body cells.

But what are the current body cells? Since after step 7, S was [(7,0), (7,1)]. So inserting old_head would be (7,0) added to front:

new_body = [ (7,0), ... ] but before moving, it's a bit confused. Maybe I need to think of the body as a list that includes all segments behind.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better not to track each step in detail and instead consider whether reaching apple is possible with such path while avoiding self-collision after each move.

But since this seems too long, maybe another approach: calculate minimum number of moves required without considering collision. But given the need for safety during movement, I think moving straight towards apple is okay if we don't go beyond 10 in x or y directions.

Wait also, at (7,0), after eating, next step would be to move right to (8,0). Is that safe? Since (8,0) isn't part of the snake's body yet. So it should be okay.

But then how about from there: moving towards increasing x again and y?

Wait no—apple is at (7,0), so we need to get back along same path or find another way.

Alternatively, perhaps an alternative path where after reaching apple, you don't have to worry because next moves are safe. But I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: since the grid is 10x10 and the snake starts at (5,5), which is towards the center, but apple is at (7,0). The Manhattan distance is:

dx = |7 -5| =2; dy=|0-5|=5. So total moves needed would be dx + dy: 2+5=7.

But since you can move diagonally? No—only orthogonal directions per step.

Wait no—the snake has to move one cell at a time, either x or y direction each move.

So Manhattan distance is indeed 2 right and 5 down. So minimal moves are 7 if moving straight without self-overlapping.

But in reality, the movement needs to be done while avoiding collisions after each step.

Given that, perhaps it's possible: start by moving two Right steps to (7,5), then five Down steps to reach apple at (7,0). But need to ensure no overlapping during this process.

Wait when you move from (5,5) → (6,5)→(7,5):

At each step:

Move 1: S becomes [ (6,5) ]
Move 2: S becomes [ (7,5) ]

But wait starting at single cell. So after two moves right, it's a single cell at (7,5). Then move down five times.

So path is moving from (7,5) →(7,4); then to (7,3), etc., each time inserting the new head and removing tail if necessary.

Wait in this case:

From (7,5):

Move 1: DOWN → (7,4). S becomes [ (7,4) ]

Move 2: DOWN → (7,3)

... until move five: arrives at (7,0), eats apple. Now body is [ (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), ... ]?

Wait no—since each move without eating causes the tail to be removed:

Each of these Down moves from (7,5) would result in S being a single cell because starting at single cell.

So after first DOWN: S = [ (7,4) ]

Second DOWN: S = [ (7,3) ]

...

After fifth DOWN: arrives at (7,0). Since this is the apple's position, when moving to it, you eat and don't remove tail. So previous body was empty because each move removed the last element.

So after eating:

S becomes [(7,0)] → wait no—because upon eating, new_head is added without removing tail? Or what?

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this; perhaps regardless of path, as long as movement doesn't cause collision and sufficient moves are made towards apple.

But the initial problem says to assume standard movement rules with possible self-collisions except when growing or in case of eating which increases size. So it's likely that a straight-line approach is feasible without much issue.

So perhaps the solution is:

1. Move RIGHT twice: ends at (7,5)
2. Then move DOWN five times: arrives at (7,0), where apple is located.

Now to confirm no self-collisions during these moves:

Each time moving down or right doesn't cause overlap because snake's body remains single cell until after step 6 when it has five cells.

Wait no—when starting as a single cell and moving down each time without eating:

- After two rights, at (7,5), S is [ (7,5) ]
Move 3: DOWN → (7,4). Insert old head (7,5) to front. Since not eating apple, remove tail.

Wait now with initial move from single cell (7,5):

After moving right twice:

Move 1: [(6,5)]
Move 2: [(7,5)]

Now Move 3: DOWN → new_head = (7,4). Insert old_head at front of S [ ]? No—S is a list that gets modified.

Wait I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to use code-like steps:

Initialize:
current_head = (5,5)
body = []

for each move in moves:
   current_head += direction
   if new_head == apple_pos and eaten_apple is False:
       # eat apple: add old_head at front, do not remove tail
       body.insert(0, old_head)
       # since just ate, mark as having eaten apple
       has_eaten = True
   else:
       # move normally: insert old_head at front, remove last if no eating
       body.insert(0, old_head)
       if len(body) > max_body_length or not eating:
           # wait, is there a maximum body length? Not mentioned.
           # in the problem statement, when you eat apple, you grow. So each move adds one cell unless moving while not eating.

But I'm overcomplicating again.

Alternatively, perhaps after the initial path to (7,5), moving down five times will cause no collisions because during those moves:

- Each time we're at position (x,y). Moving down reduces y by 1.
- As we move from (7,5) →(7,4): no collision since body is single cell.

Similarly for each step. So after eating apple, the body becomes longer but as long as movement is correct, it's okay.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal moves are 2 right and 5 down: total of 7 steps, without any issue except ensuring self-collisions do not occur during these steps.

Wait let me think about each step:

1. Move RIGHT to (6,5): body = [ (6,5) ]
2. Move RIGHT to (7,5 ): body becomes [(7,5)]
3. Move DOWN to (7,4): Insert (7,5), but since not eating apple, remove tail? Wait the initial S after step 2 is single cell.

Wait no: when moving from a single cell, each move without eating causes removal of last element.

So:

Move 1: (6,5) → body = [ (6,5) ]

Move 2: (7,5). Insert (6,5) at front. Now S is [(7,5), (6,5)]. Then remove tail? Because you didn't eat apple. So after move 2:

S becomes [ (7,5) ].

Wait no—each movement appends to the body as a new head and removes last cell if not eating.

But starting from single cell:

Move Right: current_head → insert old_head at front, then remove tail since no eating.

So for two moves right:

After first move: S becomes [ (6,5) ]
Wait wait, initial state is [(5,5)]. Moving RIGHT to (6,5):

body becomes [ (6,5) ] as new_head added without removing tail.

Then moving Right again: current_head →(7,5). Insert old_head at front of body (now has one cell), so S = [ (7,5) ], and since no eating, remove last element. So after two right moves:

S is empty? That can't be.

Wait I think the way it's working is that when you move, without eating, your body list shortens by 1 each time because you add one cell at front but then drop the tail.

But wait, initial S length: 0. After first Right move:
- current_head → (6,5)
- insert old_head (5,5) at front of empty S? So S is [ (5,5), (6,5) ]?
Wait no—initial S was [(5,5)]. Moving right:

Insert old_head into new S. Since you are adding to the front.

Wait I'm getting really stuck on this step-by-step modeling; perhaps better to accept that a straight path without self-collisions is possible and answer accordingly.
</think>

The minimum number of moves required for the snake to reach the apple at (7,0) while avoiding self-collisions is 7. The snake can move two steps to the right and then five steps downward in succession.

$\boxed{7}$
