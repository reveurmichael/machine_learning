Okay, I need to solve this Snake problem where the head is at (3,5), current direction is RIGHT, and the apple is at (3,6). Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the body cells. The snake's body includes positions [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]. So the snake is moving in a way that its body is to the left of the head, which makes sense since the current direction is RIGHT. 

The apple is at (3,6), so it's one step above the head. From (3,5) to (3,6), the y-coordinate increases by 1, meaning we need an UP move.

But wait, the snake is moving RIGHT right now. So the next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction. But since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move must not be DOWN, I think. Wait, no—rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. Oh wait, no: reversing direction would mean moving opposite of current. So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT? Or can you?

Wait, rule 3 says that the snake cannot reverse direction. Reversing direction means moving directly opposite. So if it's moving RIGHT, it can't move LEFT next because that's reversing. Similarly, if moving UP, can't move DOWN next.

So in this case, current direction is RIGHT. Therefore, the first move cannot be LEFT. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But wait, looking at the example from (1,1), when the direction is RIGHT, the next move could be any except the opposite? Or maybe no—rule 3 says if direction is NONE, any move is allowed, else can't reverse. So since current direction is RIGHT, the next move cannot be LEFT.

So first, I need to consider that on the first move, after RIGHT, I can't go LEFT.

The apple is at (3,6), which is one step UP from the head's current position (3,5). So moving UP would directly get us there. But we have to check if that path is safe.

Let me visualize the grid. The snake's body is behind it, and the head is at (3,5). If I move UP to (3,6), which is where the apple is, then that's one step.

But wait, after moving, the body would shift. Let's think about how the movement works. When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So if I move UP to (3,6), which is where the apple is, that would be a valid move as long as the new position doesn't collide with the body or go out of bounds.

Let's check collision. The current body cells are [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]. So after moving UP to (3,6), the new head is at (3,6), and the previous head (3,5) becomes part of the body. The tail would normally be removed, but since we ate an apple, the tail stays.

Wait, no: when you eat an apple, the snake grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't shrink. So after eating, the body increases in size.

But in this case, moving to (3,6) is the first move, which is the apple's position. So that would be a valid move because it's directly towards the apple and no collision with the body.

Wait, but when I move UP from (3,5), the new head is at (3,6). The previous body cells are [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)], so none of them are at (3,6) because all have x=2 except for the first two which are x=1.

So moving UP is safe. Then after that, since we ate the apple, the body grows. So next move would be?

Wait, but in this case, moving UP is the only step needed to reach the apple. So perhaps the sequence is just ["UP"], and then it's done. But let me think about constraints.

The final position check says that the number of RIGHT moves minus LEFT should equal 0 because x starts at 3 and ends at 3. The number of UP minus DOWN should be 1, which matches our case since we have one UP move.

But wait, after moving UP to (3,6), do I need to make sure there's a next move? Because the apple is eaten, the snake grows by one segment. So after eating, does it matter if the next move is possible?

Wait, the constraint says that after eating the apple, ensure at least one legal move afterward. But in this case, once we eat the apple, are there any more moves needed? No, because the objective is to reach and eat the apple.

But perhaps I need to make sure that after eating, the snake doesn't die on the next move. Wait, but if we only have one move, it's just UP.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: current head is at (3,5), direction is RIGHT. Moving UP would change the direction to UP for the next move.

But wait, no—each move changes the direction. So after moving UP once, the direction becomes UP, and then if we have more moves, they must follow that.

Wait, but in this case, do I need more than one move? Because (3,5) is adjacent to the apple at (3,6). So perhaps just one move of UP would suffice.

But let me check again. The body cells are [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]. When I move UP from (3,5) to (3,6), the new head is at (3,6). Then, the previous positions become part of the body. So the body becomes [(3,5), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]. Wait no—when you move, the snake's body segments shift. The tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

But in this case, since we are moving to eat the apple, the tail stays. So after moving UP, the body would be [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)] plus the new head at (3,6). Wait, no—the snake's body is updated each step.

Wait, perhaps I should model the movement:

- Current state: head at (3,5), body is [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]. So the full snake is [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ]? Or wait, no—the body list is given as the positions excluding the head. So the current snake is [(3,5)] + body.

So when moving to (3,6), the new head is at (3,6). The previous head (3,5) becomes part of the body. Then, since we ate an apple, the tail doesn't shrink. But wait, no—the movement step happens after the move. So first, you add the new head, then check if you ate the apple.

Wait, according to the movement rules:

- New head = head + direction
- Head becomes body segment
- Tail is removed unless apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains).

So when moving UP from (3,5) to (3,6), which is where the apple is:

1. New head: (3,6)
2. The old head (3,5) is added to the body
3. Since we ate the apple, the tail is not removed.

But wait, the initial body was [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]. So after moving UP:

- New head: (3,6)
- Body becomes [ (3,5), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ]? Wait no—the body is updated by adding the old head and removing nothing because apple was eaten.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

After moving to (3,6):

- New positions are [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ]

Because the snake grows by one segment. So the body cells after moving would be [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1)] and the head is at (3,6). But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake's body before the move is [head] + body. So when moving, the new head is added, and then the tail is removed unless apple is eaten.

Wait, let me clarify:

Movement steps per move:

1. New head = current head + direction vector.
2. If new head is outside grid or collides with body (excluding old head), die.
3. Else:
   a. Add new head to the snake's segments.
   b. If apple is at new head, score increases and tail isn't removed.
   c. Else, remove the last segment (tail) to keep length same.

So in this case, moving UP from (3,5) to (3,6), which has the apple:

1. New head is (3,6). Check collision: body is [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]. None of these are at (3,6), so safe.
2. Since new head is apple position:
   a. Add to snake segments.
   b. Tail isn't removed.

So the body after this move would be [ (3,5) ] + existing body cells? Or wait, perhaps the new head is added as first element, and since apple is eaten, tail remains.

Wait, initial body is [(1,1), (2,1), ..., (2,5)]. So when moving to (3,6):

- The snake's segments become [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ].

Because we added the new head and didn't remove any tail since apple was eaten. So total length increases by 1.

Now, after eating, I need to ensure that there's at least one legal move afterward. But in this case, since we've already reached the apple with a single move, maybe no further moves are needed. Or perhaps the problem requires the sequence of moves up until reaching the apple.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "Plan a safe path for the head to reach the apple, avoiding collisions." So the output is a list of moves that leads the head to eat the apple.

So in this case, moving UP once would suffice. But I have to make sure that after eating, there's at least one move possible. Wait, no—because once you've eaten the apple, the movement stops? Or do you continue?

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that after eating the apple, the snake can still make a move. Because the constraint says: "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward."

So in this case, after moving UP to eat the apple, I need to check if from (3,6) with the new body configuration, there is at least one valid move.

What is the direction now? After moving UP, the current direction becomes UP. So next move can't be DOWN.

Looking at the new body: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1)]. The head is at (3,6).

Possible moves from (3,6) with direction UP:

- Next move can't be DOWN because that would reverse.

So possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, UP.

Check each:

UP: Moving to (3,7). Is that within grid? Yes. Is it colliding with body?

The body cells after moving are the current body except for the new head being at (3,6). So the body includes (3,5), which is below. So moving UP again would be safe.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating because the problem only requires the moves to reach the apple, not beyond. But according to the constraints, after eating, there must be a legal move.

So if moving UP once gets us to (3,6), and then from there, we can make another move without collision, that's acceptable.

But wait, perhaps in this case, just one move is sufficient because the apple is adjacent. So maybe the moves are ["UP"].

Alternatively, let me think again: current direction is RIGHT. The first move cannot be LEFT (as per rule 3). So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

Moving UP would take us directly to the apple, which seems optimal.

But wait, could there be a situation where moving UP causes a collision with the body after the movement? No, because in the initial state, the body is [(1,1), (2,1), ..., (2,5)], and moving UP from (3,5) to (3,6) doesn't interfere with any of these.

Thus, moving UP once would be safe and reach the apple.

But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in such grid-based problems, the body could block certain paths. But here, since the head is at (3,5), and the apple is directly above, moving UP seems straightforward.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, the snake's body grows, so perhaps any subsequent moves need to consider the new body configuration. But in this case, we're only required to reach the apple, not to continue further.

Therefore, the optimal move is to go UP once.
</think>

The optimal path for the head to reach and eat the apple involves moving upwards once from (3,5) to (3,6). This single move safely navigates around the body segments without collision and successfully reaches the apple's position.
