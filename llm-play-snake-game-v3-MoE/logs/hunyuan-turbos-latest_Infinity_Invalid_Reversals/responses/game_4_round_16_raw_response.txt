{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake must move left to reduce the x-coordinate from 9 to 2 and up to increase the y-coordinate from 3 to 8. The initial moves are all 'LEFT' to avoid the body segments directly above the head, then 'UP' to approach the apple."
