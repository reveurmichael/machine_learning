========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move UP once (to reach y=7) and LEFT four times (to reach x=1). Starting with UP avoids reversing direction and moves toward the apple's y-coordinate. Subsequent LEFT moves align with the apple's x-coordinate. Each step checks for collisions (body segments are not in the new head position) and ensures safe body shifts. After reaching the apple, valid moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) remain, preventing trapping."
