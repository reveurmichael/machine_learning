========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to solve this Snake problem where the head is at (7,8), and the apple is at (9,9). The current direction is "UP", and the body cells are [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. I need to figure out a sequence of moves that will allow the snake to reach the apple safely without colliding with itself or the walls.

First, let me understand the current state. The head is at (7,8). Since the direction is "UP", the next move must not be "DOWN" because you can't reverse directions. So possible moves are "UP", "LEFT", or "RIGHT".

Looking at the body cells, they are all below and to the left of the head. Let's plot them:

- Body1: (7,7) is directly below the head.
- Body2: (7,6), also below.
- Then moving left: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So the body extends all the way to x=3 at y=6.

So, the snake's tail is at (3,6), and it's a long snake—six body segments. Since the apple is at (9,9), which is diagonally up-right from the head, I need to figure out how to navigate there without hitting any body parts or walls.

First, let me see the Manhattan distance: |9-7| + |9-8| = 2+1=3. So, it's three moves away if possible.

But considering the body movement and growth when eating the apple, I need to plan carefully.

Let me try to visualize:

Current head is at (7,8). To get to (9,9), ideally, we'd move right twice and up once. But let's check if that's possible without collision.

The first move can be "RIGHT" or "UP" since current direction is "UP". Wait, no: the movement rules say you cannot reverse. So from "UP", you can't go "DOWN". So possible moves are "UP", "LEFT", or "RIGHT".

Wait, but according to movement rules, after choosing a new direction, it's allowed as long as it's not the opposite of the current direction. Since current is "UP", cannot choose "DOWN" next.

So for the first move, options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Let me consider each option:

1. Move UP: New head would be (7,9). But wait, y=9 is within 0-9? Wait, coordinates go up to 9, but since it's 10x10 grid, I think the maximum x and y are 9. So moving from (7,8) in "UP" direction would be (7,9), which is valid.

But then check for collisions: new_head should not coincide with any BODYi except possibly the tail when it's about to move. Wait, but in this case, if we move UP, the body hasn't moved yet.

Wait, the collision check uses the state before the body shifts. So, after moving, the body will shift.

So, for the first move:

If I choose "UP", new_head is (7,9). Now, does this collide with any body cells? The body is at (7,7), (7,6), etc., so no collision. Also, within grid bounds—yes.

Then, after moving, since we didn't eat the apple yet, because apple is at (9,9), not (7,9). So, we add the old head to the body and remove the tail.

So, after first move "UP", the new head is (7,9), body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)], but wait, no—because when you move, you insert the old head at front of BODY. So previous body was [ (7,7), (7,6), ... ].

Wait, in the movement update rule:

After moving to new_head, if not eating apple, remove tail. Otherwise, grow.

So after first move "UP":

- New head: (7,9)
- Body cells before update: [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]
- Insert old head (7,8) at front → new body list becomes [ (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ]
- Since new_head is not apple, remove tail (3,6). So body becomes [ (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ]

So the snake's new state after "UP" would be head at (7,9), body as above.

But then, from there, I need to get to (9,9). So next move can't reverse. Current direction is now "UP", so next possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

If I choose "RIGHT" next, moving to (8,9).

Again, check collision: new_head (8,9) not in body except possibly the tail when it's about to move. Body after first move:

[ (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ]

So 8,9 is not in any of these.

Then, eat apple? No, because apple is at (9,9). So after moving to (8,9):

- Insert old head (7,9) → body becomes [ (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ]
- Remove tail (4,6). So new body is [ (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]

Next move: again can't reverse direction. Current direction is "RIGHT". So possible moves are RIGHT, UP, DOWN.

Wait, current direction after first two moves: initial was UP, then RIGHT. Now the new head is at (8,9). The current direction is now "RIGHT".

So next move, I can choose any except LEFT, since that's the reverse of RIGHT.

If I choose "RIGHT" again to go to (9,9), which is the apple position.

Check collision: (9,9) not in body except tail when moving. Current body after two moves:

[ (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]

So 9,9 is not in any of these.

Then, since new_head == apple, we grow the snake by adding new head and not removing tail.

So after this move:

- Insert old head (8,9)
- Since eating apple, don't remove tail. So body becomes [ (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ]

Wait, but wait: when you eat the apple, the body grows by 1, so we add the new head to the front and don't remove the tail.

So after this third move "RIGHT":

- Head is at (9,9)
- Body cells before update are [ (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]
- Insert old head (8,9) → body becomes [ (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]
- Since ate apple, don't remove tail. So body length increases by 1.

So now the snake is longer, and we've successfully eaten the apple.

But wait, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn to avoid immediate trapping.

In this scenario, after eating, the head is at (9,9), which is a corner. The body is now:

[ (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]

So next move can't be LEFT or DOWN from "RIGHT". Wait, current direction after moving to the apple was "RIGHT", so the next possible moves are RIGHT and UP/DOWN? Or no—wait, current direction is now "RIGHT" because that's how we moved into the apple.

Wait, movement directions: each move has a direction. So in this case, the last move was "RIGHT", so for the next move, you can't choose LEFT.

But since we just ate the apple at (9,9), which is the top-right corner, any move from there would be either DOWN or LEFT.

Wait, but after eating the apple, the direction is still "RIGHT" as per the last move. So next moves can't be "LEFT".

So possible next directions are UP and DOWN.

But let's check if those positions are valid.

If we choose "DOWN" from (9,9), new head would be (9,8). Check collision:

Body before movement: [ (8,9), (7,9), ... ] so (9,8) is not in the body except possibly the tail when moving. So no collision.

But wait, after eating the apple, the snake's body has grown. Let me confirm the body positions again:

After eating, body cells are [ (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]

So moving down from (9,9) to (9,8): check if any body part is there.

Looking at the body cells: none are at (9,8). So it's safe.

But wait, after moving "DOWN", what happens next? I need to make sure that this move doesn't trap the snake.

Alternatively, maybe choosing "UP" isn't possible because y=9 is already max. So from (9,9), UP would be out of bounds. So only possible moves are DOWN and LEFT, but can't choose LEFT as per direction rules.

Wait, no: current direction after eating was "RIGHT", so next move can't be LEFT. So possible directions are RIGHT's non-reverse, which is any except LEFT? Wait, I'm getting confused.

No, movement rules state that you cannot reverse the last direction. So if you moved last in "RIGHT", you can't choose "LEFT" next.

So from (9,9), after moving "RIGHT" to get there, possible moves are UP and DOWN, because those are not the reverse of RIGHT (which is LEFT).

Wait, no: movement rules say that you cannot move into the opposite direction of your current direction. So if last move was "RIGHT", next move can't be "LEFT".

So from (9,9), you can choose any direction except LEFT.

But UP from 9,9 would go to (9,10) which is invalid. So only possible moves are DOWN and RIGHT, but moving RIGHT again from (9,9) is impossible as x=9 is max.

Wait no: from (9,9), "RIGHT" would take you to (10,9), which is out of bounds. So the only valid move is DOWN to (9,8).

So after eating the apple at (9,9), the next move must be DOWN to (9,8). Is this position safe?

Looking at the body:

After eating, body cells are [ (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]

So moving to (9,8): new head is (9,8). Check collision: the body after movement would be:

- Insert old head (9,9)
- Since didn't eat apple, remove tail (5,6)

But wait, no—after eating, we are in a state where the snake has just eaten, so for the next move, whether we eat again depends on where we go. But in this case, moving to (9,8) doesn't eat an apple.

So collision check is against current body cells before movement: [ (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), ... ] So new_head (9,8): does 9,8 appear in body? The third cell is (7,8). No. So no collision.

Thus, moving DOWN to (9,8) is safe.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move UP to (7,9)
2. Move RIGHT to (8,9)
3. Move RIGHT to (9,9) and eat apple.
4. Then move DOWN to (9,8)

This seems feasible, but I need to check if in step 3, after eating the apple, moving down is possible without collision.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better path.

Let me consider another approach: starting with "RIGHT".

First move: RIGHT to (8,8). Wait, no—current head is at (7,8), so moving right would go to (8,8).

But check for collision. The body cells are [(7,7), ...], so 8,8 isn't in the body.

Also, apple is at (9,9), which is two rights and one up from here.

So after first move: head at (8,8). Then, next move can be UP or RIGHT again.

But I need to make sure that when moving towards the apple, I don't hit my own body.

Wait, but let's think step by step.

Option 1: Start with "UP".

Move 1: UP → (7,9)
Move 2: RIGHT → (8,9)
Move 3: RIGHT → (9,9) [eats apple]
Move 4: DOWN → (9,8)

This works as discussed.

But let's check another possibility. Maybe starting with "RIGHT".

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,8)
Check collision: body is [(7,7), ...]. So no collision.
Apple not yet eaten.

Then, move UP to (8,9).

Body after first move was [ (7,8) added at front ] and tail removed. Wait, no—after moving right to (8,8):

- Insert old head (7,8) → body becomes [ (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (4,6). So new body is [ (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]

Then move UP to (8,9):

Check collision: new head (8,9) not in current body.

Proceed:

Move 2: UP → (8,9)
Body after moving:
- Insert old head (8,8) → [ (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ]
- Remove tail (5,6). So new body is [ (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6) ]

Move 3: RIGHT → (9,9)
Eats apple.
Body after:
- Insert old head (8,9) → [ (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6) ]
- Don't remove tail. So body grows to 6 segments.

Then next move: from (9,9), can't go LEFT (as direction was RIGHT). So choose DOWN or UP? But (9,9) is top-right corner, so only possible move is DOWN.

Move 4: DOWN → (9,8)
Check collision: body cells are [ (8,9), ... ] which don't include (9,8).

This also works. So both starting with "UP" or "RIGHT" seem to get us there in three moves before eating the apple, but actually, wait—no, because in the first scenario, we ate the apple on the third move.

Wait, let me recount:

In the first approach, the sequence is UP → RIGHT → RIGHT (eating), which takes three moves. Then the next move is required to be DOWN, making it four moves total.

But the problem only asks for the sequence of moves up to eating the apple, I think. Because once you eat the apple, the question might be satisfied.

Wait, no—the question says "reach the apple safely", so probably the three moves to get there and eat it.

So both approaches could work, but let's see which one is safer in terms of body positions.

In the first approach:

After move 1: UP → (7,9)
Body: [ (7,8), (7,7), ... ] etc., as before.

Move 2: RIGHT → (8,9)
Body: [ (7,9), (7,8), ... ]

Move 3: RIGHT → (9,9) and eat apple.
No collision in any of these steps.

In the second approach:

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,8)
Move 2: UP → (8,9)
Move 3: RIGHT → (9,9) and eat.

Both seem valid. So either way is possible.

But wait, after eating the apple at (9,9), in the first approach, the body cells are:

[ (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (6,6), (5,6) ]

So from there, moving DOWN to (9,8) is possible.

In the second approach, after eating, body is [ (8,9), (8,8), ... ] etc.

Either way, it's safe.

But perhaps the first approach is more straightforward because it gets closer to the apple in fewer moves.

So I think the sequence would be:

1. Move UP → (7,9)
2. Move RIGHT → (8,9)
3. Move RIGHT → (9,9) and eat the apple.

This sequence seems to work without any collisions and reaches the apple in three moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine a sequence of moves that allows the snake's head at position (7, 8) to reach the apple located at (9, 9) without colliding with its body or the grid boundaries. The snake cannot move in the reverse direction immediately after each move.

### Approach
1. **Initial Analysis**: The snake starts at (7, 8) facing upwards. The apple is at (9, 9), requiring two moves to the right and one move up from the starting position.
2. **Move Constraints**: The snake cannot move in the reverse direction of its last move. Therefore, after moving up or down, it cannot immediately move down or up respectively, and similarly for left and right.
3. **Path Planning**: Calculate the minimal moves required to reach the apple while avoiding self-collision.

### Solution Code
```python
# The sequence of moves to reach the apple
moves = [
    ('UP', 1),
    ('RIGHT', 2),
    ('RIGHT', 3)
]

for direction, step in moves:
    if direction == 'UP':
        new_position = (7 + 0, 8 + step)
    elif direction == 'DOWN':
        new_position = (7 + 0, 8 - step)
    elif direction == 'LEFT':
        new_position = (7 - step, 8 + 0)
    else:  # RIGHT
        new_position = (7 + step, 8 + 0)

print("The snake reaches the apple safely with the moves:", moves)
```

### Explanation
1. **Move UP**: The snake moves from (7, 8) to (7, 9). This is a safe move as it does not collide with any part of its body.
2. **Move RIGHT**: The snake then moves from (7, 9) to (8, 9). Again, this move is safe and brings the snake closer to the apple.
3. **Move RIGHT again**: Finally, the snake moves from (8, 9) to (9, 9), where it reaches and eats the apple.

This sequence ensures that the snake reaches the apple without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds, thus solving the problem efficiently.
