Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem where a snake has to reach an apple without colliding with its own body or the walls. The snake is on a 10x10 grid, starting at (1,1), and the apple is at (9,2). 

First, let me understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (1,1), the direction is "DOWN", and the body has one segment at (1,2). So the full snake would be [ (1,1), (1,2) ].

Since the direction is currently "DOWN", I can't move in the opposite direction, which would be "UP". The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But wait, moving DOWN from (1,1) would take me to (1,0), which is outside the grid? No, because y=0 is allowed since the grid goes from 0 to 9. Wait, no—because in the problem statement, the coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. So moving down from (1,1) would take y from 1 to 0, which is still within bounds.

But I need to make sure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail if it's about to move. Since in this case, the body is only one segment behind the head at (1,2). So moving down to (1,0) would be safe because (1,2) is two steps away.

Wait, but after moving down, the body will update. Let me think about how the body moves. If I move in any direction that's not opposite to current direction, which is "DOWN", so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but since it's the first move and the direction was NONE? Wait no—the initial direction given is "DOWN". So for the first move, can I change direction?

Wait, according to the rules, movement cannot reverse. So if current direction is "DOWN", next move can't be "UP". The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or same as current direction (DOWN). But in this case, we need to find a path that gets us from (1,1) to (9,2).

So the apple is at (9,2), which is 8 units to the right and 1 unit up from the head. So the total moves needed are 8 rights and 1 up, but in some order.

But since the snake can't move into its own body except when growing, I need to make sure that each step doesn't cause a collision with any part of the body after it shifts.

Let me try to plan the path:

Starting at (1,1), direction is DOWN. So first, what are my options?

If I go DOWN, head moves to (1,0). Then, the body would move: since we're not eating an apple, the tail (current body segment) will be removed. The new body segments would be [(1,2)] becomes [(1,1), (1,2)], but wait no—because when moving normally, after inserting the old head into the body, the tail is removed.

Wait, movement steps:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check for collision.
3. Update body:
   a. Insert old head at front of BODY.
   b. If new_head == apple, grow (don't remove tail). Else, remove last element.

So in this case, after moving down to (1,0), the body would be:

- Insert old head (1,1) into front: [(1,1)]
- Since new_head is not the apple, we remove last element. So the body becomes empty? Because initial body was [(1,2)], then insert (1,1) at front to make [ (1,1), (1,2) ], but since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (which is (1,2)), so body becomes [ (1,1) ].

Wait no: initial body was [(1,2)]. After inserting old head (1,1) at front, it's [ (1,1), (1,2) ]. Then since new_head isn't apple, remove last element. So body is now just [ (1,1) ]? But that can't be because the snake has a head and one body segment.

Wait no—the full snake S is [ HEAD, BODY1, ... ]. After moving down:

- New head is (1,0)
- The old head was (1,1), which becomes BODY1.
- Then, check if new_head is apple: No.
- So remove the last element of BODY. Initially, body was [(1,2)], so after inserting (1,1) at front, it's [ (1,1), (1,2) ]. Removing last gives [ (1,1) ].

But then, the new snake would be HEAD = (1,0), and BODY = [ (1,1) ], which is continuous? Because (1,0) to (1,1) is a distance of 1 in y-direction. So that's okay.

So after moving down once, the body is [(1,1)], head at (1,0).

But then I can't move up because it would take me back to (1,1), which is now part of the body. So moving up from (1,0) would cause collision with BODY1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to change direction early on to start moving right towards the apple.

Wait, but initial direction is DOWN, so first move can't be UP, but can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But if I choose to go RIGHT from (1,1), that would take me to (2,1). Let's see:

- new_head = (2,1)
- Check collision: Is (2,1) in any body cell except possible tail? The current body is [(1,2)], which is not same as (2,1), so safe.
- Insert old head (1,1) into front of BODY → [ (1,1), (1,2) ]
- Since new_head != apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (1,1) ]
- So now, snake is at (2,1) with body [(1,1)]

This seems safe.

So perhaps the best approach is to start moving right as much as possible towards the apple.

But let's plan a path that gets us from (1,1) to (9,2). Since the apple is 8 steps right and 1 step up, we need to make sure we can do that without colliding with our body.

One approach is to move right until we reach x=9, then move up once. But let's see if that's possible.

Starting at (1,1), direction is DOWN. So first move options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

If I go RIGHT to (2,1):

- New head: (2,1)
- Body becomes [ (1,1) ]

Next move can be RIGHT again since current direction was RIGHT now? Wait no—the previous direction was changed from DOWN to RIGHT. So movement directions cannot reverse.

Wait, the initial direction is "DOWN", so the first move can't be UP. But after moving in a different direction, say RIGHT, then next moves must not go LEFT if current direction is RIGHT (can't reverse).

But perhaps planning a straight line right is possible.

Let me try:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1), body [(1,1)]

Move 2: RIGHT → (3,1), body [ (2,1) ]

And continue this until x=9.

Each time moving right and updating the body accordingly. But after each move, we need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body except possibly when it's about to move.

Wait, but as we grow towards the apple, do we have enough space? Let's think:

After moving right 8 times, from x=1 to x=9, y remains 1. So moves would be RIGHT 8 times: (2,1), (3,1)... up to (9,1).

Then, from (9,1), move UP once to (9,2) where the apple is.

But wait, after moving right 8 times, the body will have grown? Because each time we're moving towards the apple without eating it yet. Only when we reach (9,2) do we eat it.

Wait no—each step except the last one doesn't involve eating an apple. So until we get to (9,2), the snake's length remains as 1+number of moves minus 1? Wait, initial body is [(1,2)], but after first move right, the body is [ (1,1) ].

Wait, let me re-examine:

Initial state: head at (1,1), body [(1,2)].

Move RIGHT to (2,1):

- new_head = (2,1)
- insert old head into body → [ (1,1), (1,2) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (1,1) ]

So now, the snake is head at (2,1), body [(1,1)].

Next move RIGHT to (3,1):

- new_head = (3,1)
- insert old head (2,1) into body → [ (2,1), (1,1) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (2,1) ]

So the snake is now at (3,1) with body [(2,1)].

This pattern continues. Each right move adds a new head and removes the previous head from the body. So after 8 right moves:

Positions would be:

(9,1), with body being [ (8,1), (7,1), ..., (2,1) ]? Wait no—each time you add a head and remove the last, so the body is always one segment behind.

Wait: initial move to (2,1): body [ (1,1) ]

Move to (3,1): body [ (2,1) ]

So each step, the body follows by one. So after 8 right moves:

head at (9,1), body [(8,1)]

Then, next move would be UP from (9,1) to (9,2):

- new_head = (9,2)
- insert old head (9,1) into body → [ (9,1), (8,1) ]
- check if (9,2) is apple: yes.

So since we ate the apple, the body grows. So after this move:

- body becomes [ (9,1), (8,1) ] + new head? Or wait, step by step.

After computing new_head = (9,2):

Check for collision: are any of the existing body segments equal to (9,2)? Initially, before moving, the body is [(8,1)]. So (9,2) is not in that, so safe.

Then:

- Insert old head (9,1) into front of BODY → [ (9,1), (8,1) ]
- Since new_head == apple, we don't remove the last element. So body remains [ (9,1), (8,1) ]

So now, snake is at (9,2) with body [ (9,1), (8,1) ].

Is that okay? Because from (9,2) to (9,1) is one step down, and then (8,1) is two steps left. So the entire snake is continuous: 9,2 → 9,1 → 8,1.

That's fine.

But now, after eating the apple, the next move could be problematic because the body has grown. But since we're done moving towards the apple, perhaps that's acceptable.

So overall, the path would involve:

- Starting at (1,1), direction is DOWN.
- First move: RIGHT to (2,1). New head (2,1), body [(1,1)].
- Next 7 moves: continue RIGHT each time, reaching (9,1) with body [(8,1)].
- Then move UP to (9,2), eating the apple. Now, body is [ (9,1), (8,1) ].

This seems feasible without any collisions except at the end when we grow by eating the apple.

But wait, what about after moving up, could the next moves cause a collision?

Well, in this plan, once you reach (9,2), the snake is done. So I think this would work.

So the total moves would be 8 rights and 1 up, totaling 9 moves.

But let's make sure that each step doesn't cause any collisions with body segments except when eating the apple.

After moving right each time:

Each move adds a new head and drops the tail. So the body is always one segment behind, so as long as we don't loop back on ourselves, there shouldn't be any collision.

But in this case, since all moves are to the right or up, which are in straight lines, no loops would occur.

Therefore, the minimal number of steps needed is 9: 8 rights and 1 up.

Thus, the path is:

(1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → ... → (9,1) → (9,2)

So in terms of directions: RIGHT x7 times after initial move.

But wait, from (1,1), first direction change can be to RIGHT. So the sequence is:

Move 1: RIGHT

Moves 2-8: RIGHT each time (total 7 more moves) to reach (9,1)

Move 9: UP to (9,2).

So total of 9 moves.

Hence, I think this is a valid path without any collisions.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate the snake from its starting position at (1,1) to the target apple located at (9,2). The snake can move in four directions but cannot reverse direction immediately. We must ensure that each move does not cause the head of the snake to collide with any part of its body except when it grows after eating the apple.

### Approach
The approach involves moving the snake towards the target apple using a combination of right and up movements. The key steps are:
1. **Initial Move**: Change direction from DOWN to RIGHT to start moving towards the apple.
2. **Subsequent Moves**: Continue moving RIGHT until reaching x=9, y=1.
3. **Final Move**: Once at (9,1), move UP to reach (9,2) where the apple is located.

This strategy ensures that the snake progresses directly towards the target without unnecessary detours, minimizing the risk of collision with its own body segments except when it grows after eating the apple.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial position and state
head = (1, 1)
direction = "RIGHT"
body = [(1, 2)]  # Starting body segment

def move_snake(new_direction):
    global head, direction, body
    if new_direction == "UP":
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] + 1)
    elif new_direction == "DOWN":
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] - 1)
    elif new_direction == "LEFT":
        new_head = (head[0] - 1, head[1])
    else:  # RIGHT
        new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])

    # Check collision with body except possible tail if it's moving
    if new_head in body[:-1]:  # Exclude the last element as it will move
        return False

    # Update body
    body.insert(0, new_head)
    if not is_apple(new_head):
        body.pop()

    head = new_head
    direction = new_direction
    return True

def is_apple(position):
    return position == (9, 2)

# Path planning:
# Move right until x=9, y remains 1
for _ in range(8):  # Since we are already at (1,1), need to move right 7 times more after first move
    if direction != "RIGHT":
        move_snake("RIGHT")  # Change direction once
    else:
        move_snake(direction)

# After reaching (9,1), move up to eat the apple
if head == (9, 1):
    move_snake("UP")
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (1,1) with its body segment at (1,2). The initial direction is set to RIGHT after the first move.
2. **Movement Loop**: The loop moves the snake RIGHT seven more times to reach (9,1). Each move updates the head and adjusts the body segments accordingly.
3. **Final Move**: Once at (9,1), the snake changes direction to UP and moves to (9,2) where it eats the apple, causing the body to grow without removing the last segment.

This approach ensures that each move is safe and efficient, leading the snake directly to the target in minimal steps without collisions.
