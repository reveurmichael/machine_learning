{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 6 times to reduce the x-coordinate from 6 to 0, then down once to reduce the y-coordinate from 6 to 5 (apple's position). Each left move avoids body collisions as the body trails behind without blocking the path. The final down move reaches the apple safely, and subsequent moves (e.g., down again) remain possible without trapping."
