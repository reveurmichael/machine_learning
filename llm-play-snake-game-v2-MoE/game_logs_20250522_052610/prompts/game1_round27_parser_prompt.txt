<think>
Okay, so I need to help this snake eat an apple without dying. Let's see what the situation is.

The snake's head is at (5,1), and the current direction is DOWN. The body is behind it at (5,3) and (5,2). So the snake is moving downward from (5,2) to (5,3), with the head at (5,1). Wait, that seems a bit confusing because if the head is at (5,1) and the direction is DOWN, then the body should be in front of it. But according to the given body cells [(5,3), (5,2)], that means after moving, the new head would be at (5,0), which is outside the grid because y=0 is the bottom, so down from (5,1) would take it out of bounds? Wait no, the grid is 10x10, with y going up. So coordinates go from (0,0) as bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.

So moving DOWN from (5,1) would decrease y by 1, taking it to (5,0). But that's still within the grid since y can be 0 or higher. Wait no, wait: according to movement rules, UP is y+1, so moving DOWN would decrease y. So if the head is at (5,1), moving DOWN once would take it to (5,0), which is valid because y=0 is allowed.

Wait, but the current direction is DOWN, and the body cells are [(5,3), (5,2)]. Hmm, that suggests that after the next move, the head would be at (5,0), and then the body segments shift. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the body positions. The body cells list doesn't include the head's current position because it's only the body parts, right? So the snake is currently at [(5,1) as head, followed by (5,2) and (5,3)]. Wait no: if the direction is DOWN, then the head is moving down. But wait, the body cells are given in the order of [(5,3), (5,2)], which suggests that the snake's path is moving upward? That can't be right because the current direction is DOWN.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to visualize this. The head is at (5,1). The body cells are [(5,3), (5,2)]. So when the snake moves, each part follows the next. If it's moving DOWN from (5,1), then after one step, the new head would be (5,0). Then, the body parts would shift: the previous head becomes the first body cell, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me focus on the problem: the snake is at (5,1) with direction DOWN. The apple is at (4,2). So to get from (5,1) to (4,2), the x-coordinate needs to decrease by 1, and y increases by 1.

So the Manhattan distance is |5-4| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. But because of the movement rules, especially the no-reversing direction, I need to plan carefully.

First move options: since current direction is DOWN, the first move cannot be UP (since that's the reverse). So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But wait, the apple is at (4,2), which is to the left and up from the head. But the snake is moving DOWN currently. If I turn LEFT, then next move can't be RIGHT. Wait, no: movement rules say you cannot reverse direction immediately. So if current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. The other directions are allowed.

So from (5,1) in DOWN direction:

If I make a LEFT move first, that would take me to (4,1). Then, next moves could be up towards (4,2).

Alternatively, moving DOWN again would take head to (5,0), which is further away and perhaps not optimal.

Wait, but let's think about the body. The body cells are [(5,3), (5,2)]. So if I move LEFT from (5,1) to (4,1), then the new body will be [ (5,1), (5,3), (5,2) ]? Wait no: when the head moves, each segment follows. So moving left would make the new head at (4,1). Then, the previous head (5,1) becomes part of the body, followed by (5,2) and (5,3). But since the snake's direction was DOWN, moving LEFT is allowed as it's not a reverse.

Wait no: current direction is DOWN. So when the snake moves, if it changes direction, it can't go in the opposite. So moving from DOWN to LEFT or RIGHT is okay, but not UP.

So first move options:

1. Move LEFT to (4,1).
2. Move DOWN to (5,0).
3. Move RIGHT to (6,1).

But moving DOWN would take me further away from the apple's y-coordinate of 2. Since current head is at y=1, moving down takes it to y=0, which is even lower, making it harder to reach y=2.

So perhaps moving LEFT first is better. Then, next move can be UP towards the apple.

But wait: if I move LEFT, then the next direction can't be RIGHT (since that's a reverse). So after LEFT, I could go UP.

Let me outline possible moves:

Move 1: LEFT to (4,1).

Now, body cells become [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]? Or wait, when the head moves, each body part follows. So initial body is [(5,3), (5,2)]. After moving LEFT, the new head is at (4,1). The previous head (5,1) becomes part of the body, so body becomes [ (5,1), (5,3), (5,2) ]? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps when the snake moves, each segment follows. So after moving LEFT from (5,1):

- New head: (4,1)
- Previous head (5,1) becomes first body part
- Then (5,3), (5,2)? No, that doesn't make sense because the body is behind.

Wait, perhaps I should model the snake's movement step by step. Let me think about each move and how the body updates.

Current state:

Head: (5,1)
Direction: DOWN
Body cells: [(5,3), (5,2)]

So the snake is in a straight line moving down from (5,2) to (5,3). But wait, that can't be right because if direction is DOWN, then after each move, the head moves further down. So perhaps the body is [(5,2), (5,3)].

Wait no: when the snake moves in a certain direction, the body follows. So initial positions:

Head at (5,1). The next segment is (5,2) behind it, and then (5,3) after that. So the direction is DOWN, so each move adds to the bottom of this line.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the snake moves step by step. Let's say in the initial state, the snake has a head at (5,1), followed by body segments at (5,2) and (5,3). So when it moves DOWN again, the new head would be (5,0), then body becomes [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]. But wait, that can't be because moving down from (5,1) would take head to (5,0), and then the body segments shift accordingly.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's get back to the problem: the apple is at (4,2). The head needs to move left and up to reach it.

So first move: possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

If I choose LEFT:

- New head: (4,1)
- Direction becomes LEFT
- Body cells update: previous head (5,1) is added to body, so new body is [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]

Wait no: when the snake moves, each part follows. So initial body is [ (5,3), (5,2) ] after moving from those positions. If the head was at (5,1) and direction is DOWN, then perhaps the body cells are in front of it.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body cells are ordered. The body list probably represents the segments following the head. So if the snake's direction is DOWN, after each move, the next segment would be added below the current head.

But regardless, let's focus on planning the moves.

Option 1:

Move 1: LEFT to (4,1). Now, head is at (4,1), direction is LEFT.

Next move can't be RIGHT because it's reversing. So next possible directions are UP or DOWN.

From (4,1), moving UP would take us to (4,2), which is the apple's position.

So let's plan:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,1)
Move 2: UP → (4,2)

But wait, does this cause collision with the body?

After move 1, the new head is at (4,1). The previous head was (5,1), so the body would now include that. So body cells after first move are [(5,1), (5,3), (5,2)]? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, when moving LEFT from (5,1) to (4,1), the previous head is added to the body. So the new body is [ (5,1), (5,3), (5,2) ]?

No, that doesn't make sense because (5,3) was behind (5,2). Maybe I'm not modeling this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the body list represents the segments in the order they are following the head. So initial body is [ (5,3), (5,2) ], meaning that after the head, the next segment is (5,2), then (5,3).

Wait, but if the direction is DOWN from (5,1), moving to (5,0), then (5,2) would be in front? No, because when you move down from (5,1), you go to (5,0). So perhaps the body cells are behind.

This is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach: plan moves that will allow the head to reach the apple without collision and ensure that after eating, there's at least one move left.

So, starting from (5,1), direction DOWN.

Option 1: Move LEFT first to get closer to the apple.

Move 1: LEFT → (4,1). Now, direction is LEFT. Body cells are now [ (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ]? Or perhaps not, but regardless, we need to check for collision.

After moving to (4,1), does this new position collide with any body part?

Current body after first move would be [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]? So the head is at (4,1). None of the body parts are at (4,1), so it's safe.

Next, we need to move towards (4,2).

From (4,1), possible moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse. So options are UP or DOWN.

If I move UP from (4,1) to (4,2):

- New head at (4,2). Now, check body collision.

Body after second move: previous body was [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1)], and the new head is (4,2). So body becomes [ (4,1), (5,3), (5,2) ]? Or perhaps I'm not getting this right. Wait, when moving from (4,1) to (4,2), the previous head (4,1) becomes part of the body.

So after move 2: UP → (4,2). Now, check if (4,2) is in the new body.

The new body would be [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]? Or perhaps it's [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ] when moving LEFT first. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the body cells are always behind the head in the order they were added. So each move adds a new head position to the front and removes from the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So initial state:

Head: (5,1)
Body: [ (5,2), (5,3) ]

Because when moving DOWN, the next segment after (5,1) would be (5,2), then (5,3).

Wait, that makes more sense. So body cells are in order from head to tail? No, usually, the body is behind. So if the snake's direction is DOWN, the segments follow in the same path.

So when moving DOWN again:

- New head: (5,0)
- Body becomes [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ]

But that might cause a collision with itself after several moves. But in this case, we need to move towards (4,2).

Alternatively, perhaps the body cells are the parts behind the head.

So when moving LEFT from (5,1):

- New head: (4,1)
- Body becomes [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ]

Wait no, because before moving, the body was [ (5,2), (5,3) ] behind the head. So when you move LEFT to (4,1), the new body is [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ]. So now, the snake's position is [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)].

But then, moving UP from (4,1):

- New head: (4,2)
- Body becomes [ (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ]

So the new body includes all previous positions except the tail, which is now (5,3). Wait no, because when you move and add a new head, the last segment (tail) is removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, in most snake games, when you move, each part follows the previous one. So:

- Head moves.
- Each body part moves to the position of the preceding part.
- If moving into food, the tail remains; else, the tail moves and may be cut off if there's no food.

But in our case, we're not considering eating yet because the apple is at (4,2).

So when moving from (5,1) to (4,1):

- New head: (4,1)
- Previous body parts [ (5,2), (5,3) ] shift: each part moves to the position of the previous one.

Wait no, that would mean:

After move 1: LEFT to (4,1)

Body becomes [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ]

Because each body part follows the head. So the snake's segments are now at (4,1), then (5,1), then (5,2), then (5,3).

So when moving to (4,2):

- New head: (4,2)
- Body becomes [ (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ]

Wait, no. Let me model it step by step.

Initial state:

Head: (5,1)

Body cells: [(5,2), (5,3)]

So the snake is a line from (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1).

Move 1: LEFT → new head at (4,1). Direction changes to LEFT.

Now, each body part moves:

- The segment behind head (5,1) was at (5,2), which is now moving to (5,1).
- Then the next segment (5,3) moves to (5,2).

So after move 1, the snake's segments are:

Head: (4,1)
Body: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]

Now, check if new head (4,1) is in body? No.

Move 2: UP → new head at (4,2).

Now, each body part moves again:

- Previous head (4,1) moves to (5,1)'s position.
Wait no, the body parts follow the previous positions. So after moving up from (4,1), the new head is (4,2). The segment that was at (4,1) will now be at the next position.

This is getting too complicated; perhaps it's better to find another path.

Alternative approach: Can I reach the apple without moving LEFT first?

Let me see. From (5,1), can I move DOWN, then RIGHT, then UP? Let's try:

Move 1: DOWN → (5,0)

Body cells become [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)].

Check collision with body? No, because new head is at (5,0).

Move 2: RIGHT → (6,0). Body becomes [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ]

No collision.

Move 3: UP → (6,1). Check if this position is in body? The body after move 2 was [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ]. So new head is at (6,1), which is not in the body. Good.

Move 4: UP → (6,2). Again, check if this position is in body? No.

Move 5: LEFT → (5,2). Now, check collision with body.

Body after move 4 was [ ... ] Wait, each time we move, the body shifts.

This approach seems too long. Maybe moving LEFT and UP is more efficient.

Let me go back to the first option:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,1)

Move 2: UP → (4,2) which is the apple's position.

After eating the apple, we need to ensure that there's at least one move left. So after moving into (4,2), the body would have grown unless we decide not to eat, but I think in this case, it's assumed that the apple is eaten.

But wait, no: if you move into a position with food, your snake grows by adding an extra segment at the tail instead of losing one. So after eating the apple, the body increases in length.

But perhaps that's not necessary to model here because we just need to reach the apple without collision, regardless of growth.

Wait, but according to the initial problem, it's just about finding a path where each move doesn't collide with the body, so I can ignore the growth for now.

So the plan is:

1. Move LEFT to (4,1).
2. Then move UP to (4,2).

Check if these moves are possible without collision.

After first move, the head is at (4,1), and body is [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ].

No collision because (4,1) isn't in the body.

Second move: UP from (4,1) to (4,2). Now, check if any of the body parts are at (4,2).

Body after first move is [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ], and the new head is at (4,2). So none of the body cells are at (4,2), so no collision.

Thus, this path works: LEFT then UP.

So the answer would be two moves: LEFT then UP.

Wait, but let me make sure that after moving to (4,1) and then to (4,2), there's at least one more move possible. But according to the problem statement, it's just about reaching the apple without collision, not necessarily having any remaining moves unless specified.

So in this case, moving LEFT then UP gets us to the apple safely.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to find a path for the snake to reach the apple at position (4, 2) without colliding with its own body. The snake starts at position (5, 1) and is initially moving downwards.

### Approach
The approach involves determining two moves that will allow the snake to safely reach the apple:
1. **Move LEFT** from (5, 1) to (4, 1). This move shifts the head left without colliding with any part of the body.
2. **Move UP** from (4, 1) to (4, 2), which is the position of the apple. This second move ensures that the snake reaches the target without hitting any part of its body.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial positions
head = (5, 1)
body = [(5, 2), (5, 3)]
apple = (4, 2)

# Move 1: LEFT to (4, 1)
new_head = (4, 1)
# Check for collision with body after move
if new_head not in [head] + body:
    head = new_head
    # Update body positions accordingly
    # The body shifts as each part follows the previous one
    # This step is conceptual and doesn't affect the collision check

# Move 2: UP to (4, 2)
new_head = (4, 2)
if new_head not in [head] + body:
    head = new_head
    print("Apple reached successfully!")
```

### Explanation
1. **Move LEFT**: The snake moves from its initial position (5, 1) to (4, 1). This move is safe because the new head position (4, 1) does not collide with any part of the body.
2. **Move UP**: From the new position (4, 1), the snake then moves upwards to (4, 2). This second move also avoids collision and successfully reaches the apple.

This approach ensures that each move is safe and leads the snake directly to the target position without any self-collision.
