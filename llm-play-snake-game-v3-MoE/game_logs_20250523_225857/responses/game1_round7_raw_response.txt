========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how the snake can move from (4,4) to eat the apple at (1,2). The current direction is "LEFT", and the body cells are [(5,4), (5,3)]. Let me break this down.

First, the snake's head is at (4,4), facing LEFT. So initially, it can move left towards decreasing x-coordinates. But I need to make sure that every move doesn't cause a collision with its own body or go out of bounds.

The apple is at (1,2). That's pretty far from the current position. Since the snake starts moving left, maybe it can loop around and approach the apple from another direction. But wait, the initial movement to the left might take it towards (3,4), then (2,4), etc., which doesn't directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps turning the direction once it's safe would be better. The snake can't reverse direction immediately, so after moving LEFT a few times, maybe it can turn UP or RIGHT to head towards the apple.

Let me map out possible paths. Starting at (4,4), if I move LEFT:

1. Move LEFT: (3,4). Now, body is [(4,4), (5,4)].
2. Next move could be LEFT again: (2,4). Body becomes [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)] and so on.

But moving straight left might not get me near the apple efficiently. Alternatively, after some moves, turning UP might allow me to go towards the apple's y-coordinate of 2.

Wait, let me calculate the Manhattan distance between head (4,4) and apple (1,2). The difference in x is -3, so 3 steps left, and y is 0. So total steps required are at least 3 LEFT moves. But moving straight left might cause issues with body segments.

Wait, the snake's body is [(5,4), (5,3)]. So when the head moves, it adds a new segment to the front, and if it doesn't eat the apple, the tail moves back. So after each move, the body adjusts.

If I go LEFT from (4,4) to (3,4), the new body would be [(4,4), (5,4)], but then since we didn't eat the apple, the tail (from the initial body) moves back. Wait no, in the first example, when moving LEFT, the old head becomes BODY1, and if it doesn't eat the apple, the tail is removed.

Wait, let me clarify movement step:

When you move, new_head is computed, then:

- Insert old head into BODY as the new front.
- If new_head is the apple, grow by not removing the tail. Otherwise, remove the last element (tail) to maintain length.

So in the initial state, the body is [(5,4), (5,3)]. When moving LEFT to (3,4):

1. New head is (3,4). Check if it's valid: within grid, not colliding with any body except possibly tail.
2. Insert old head (4,4) into BODY as new front → BODY becomes [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)].
3. Since new_head isn't the apple, remove last element of BODY → now [(4,4), (5,4)].
4. Update HEAD to (3,4).

So after first move: body is [(4,4), (5,4)], head at (3,4). Next move: if I go LEFT again to (2,4):

1. New head (2,4): valid.
2. Insert old head (3,4) into BODY → [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)].
3. Since no apple eaten, remove last element of BODY → [(3,4), (4,4)]. HEAD is now (2,4).

Continuing this way, the body segments are getting longer on the left side.

But how does this help me reach (1,2)? I need to get closer in y-coordinate. Maybe after moving LEFT a few times, I can turn UP or RIGHT.

Alternatively, perhaps turning RIGHT initially isn't possible because current direction is LEFT, and reversing would be "RIGHT" next move, which is not allowed immediately.

Wait, no: the rules say you can't reverse directions on the first move. So if current direction is LEFT, first move cannot be RIGHT. But after that, any direction except opposite of current.

So to change direction, I need to have moved in a certain direction first.

But maybe turning UP after moving LEFT a bit could help me get closer to y=2.

Wait, but from (4,4), moving LEFT gets x decreasing. The apple is at (1,2). So perhaps after moving LEFT enough, then move UP.

Let's plan a path:

1. Move LEFT as much as possible until near the top or where turning becomes feasible.
2. Then change direction to UP towards y=2.

But I need to avoid collisions with my own body.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to go right (but that would reverse direction if current is LEFT). Wait, can't do that immediately.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to move down first to reach lower y, but moving DOWN from (4,4) to (4,3), then (4,2), and so on. But let me think about the path.

Wait, the apple is at (1,2). So to get there, x needs to go left 3 steps, y down 2 steps.

But starting at (4,4):

To reach x=1: need 3 LEFT moves. To reach y=2: from y=4, need 2 DOWN moves.

So total 5 moves, but also need to manage the body segments.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving LEFT a few times and then DOWN or UP.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about possible step-by-step movements.

Another approach is to simulate each move and see if it's possible.

Starting at (4,4), direction LEFT.

Move 1: LEFT → (3,4). Body becomes [(4,4), (5,4)]. Tail was originally [(5,4), (5,3)], but after removing tail, it's now [(4,4), (5,4)].

Wait no, initial body is [(5,4), (5,3)]. After first move:

- Insert old head (4,4) → new BODY: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)].
- Since didn't eat apple, remove last element → [(4,4), (5,4)].

So body after first move is [(4,4), (5,4)]. Head at (3,4).

Move 2: LEFT → (2,4). New BODY:

- Insert old head (3,4) → new front is (3,4).
- Remove tail if not eaten. So current body was [(4,4), (5,4)].

After moving to (2,4):

- Insert (3,4) at front: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)].
- Since didn't eat apple, remove last element → [(3,4), (4,4)].

Body now is [(3,4), (4,4)]. Head at (2,4).

Move 3: LEFT → (1,4). Check if valid:

- New head (1,4) is within grid.
- Check body: current body is [(3,4), (4,4)].

So new_head isn't in the body except possibly the tail. Since (1,4) is not occupied by any part of the body except maybe the tail after this move. But wait, the tail was (4,4). So no collision.

Proceeding:

- Insert old head (2,4) → new front: [(2,4), (3,4), (4,4)].
- Since didn't eat apple, remove last element (4,4): body becomes [(2,4), (3,4)].
- HEAD is now (1,4).

Move 4: Now at (1,4). Next move options are LEFT or UP or DOWN (since current direction was LEFT, can choose any except RIGHT? Or can I choose any except LEFT's opposite which is RIGHT.

Wait, movement rules: cannot reverse directions. So if current direction is LEFT, next can be anything except RIGHT.

So from (1,4), possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

If I move LEFT again, x would go to 0, which is allowed, but then the snake's head is at (0,4). But that's far from the apple. Alternatively, moving UP or DOWN might be better towards y=2.

But from (1,4), moving UP: (1,5) which is outside grid? Wait no, coordinates go up to 9. So (1,5) is valid.

Wait, but that would take me further away from the apple's y=2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe after moving to (1,4), I can turn DOWN to go towards y=2.

So move 5: DOWN → (1,3). Check if valid:

- Within grid.
- Body is [(2,4), (3,4)].
- New head (1,3) isn't in body.

Proceeding:

- Insert old head (1,4) into BODY as front: [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)].
- Since didn't eat apple, remove last element → [(1,4), (2,4)].
- HEAD is now (1,3).

Move 6: DOWN → (1,2). That's the apple! So I need to check if this move would cause a collision.

At this point:

- New head is (1,2).
- Check body: current body is [(1,4), (2,4)].
- So new_head isn't in the body.

Then proceed to eat the apple. Since it's eaten, I don't remove the tail.

So after move 6:

- Insert old head (1,3) into BODY: [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].
- Because we ate the apple, we keep all body segments, so no removal of tail.

Now, HEAD is at (1,2). Next moves can be any direction except RIGHT since current is DOWN.

But from here, I need to manage the body. However, since I've eaten the apple, next move will have a longer body.

Wait, but perhaps it's possible now to continue moving towards other directions.

Alternatively, after being at (1,2), maybe I can change direction and start moving UP or RIGHT to clear any potential blockage with my own body.

But wait, if the snake is now sitting on (1,2) with body segments [1,3; 1,4; 2,4], perhaps it's better to start moving rightwards to clear the path.

So move 7: RIGHT → (2,2). Check validity:

- Within grid.
- Body is [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].
- New head (2,2) isn't in body.

Proceeding:

- Insert old head (1,2) into front: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].
- Since we ate apple, don't remove tail. So body remains as is, but new front added.

Wait no: when you eat the apple, the next move keeps the body length same as before? Or does it allow adding segments without removing?

I think when you eat the apple, the tail doesn't get removed in subsequent moves. So from then on, each move adds a new segment to the front without removing the last one.

So after move 6:

- Body is [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].
- Next move: insert (1,2) at front → [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)].
- Then, in the next moves, each time you'll add a new segment to the front without removing.

So now, at (1,2), body is longer. To clear it, I can start moving right or up.

But perhaps moving UP:

Move 8: UP → (1,3). Wait, but we already have body at (1,3).

No, can't move to same spot as body segment.

Alternatively, perhaps first move to (2,2) and then manage the body.

But maybe a better approach is needed. Alternatively, I could have turned earlier.

Wait, let me recount the steps so far:

Move 1: LEFT → (3,4), body [(4,4), (5,4)]

Move 2: LEFT → (2,4), body [(3,4), (4,4)]

Move 3: LEFT → (1,4), body [(2,4), (3,4)]

Move 4: DOWN → (1,3), body [(1,4), (2,4)]

Move 5: DOWN → (1,2) [EAT APPLE]

Then from here, manage the body.

But after eating the apple at move 6, every subsequent move adds a new segment without removing any. So to avoid collision, I need to make sure the head doesn't go into any of the body segments except possibly the tail.

So perhaps moving UP or RIGHT is better.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible to clear the path by moving in opposite direction from where the body is.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe there's another way.

Alternative approach: after moving to (1,4), instead of moving DOWN, try moving UP to (1,5). Then move LEFT or something else. But that seems further away.

Alternatively, perhaps a different initial path.

Wait, starting over:

From (4,4):

1. Move DOWN → (4,3): is this allowed? Current direction is LEFT, so can't reverse immediately.

Wait no: movement rules say you can't reverse directions on the first move. So if current is LEFT, next move can be anything except RIGHT.

So moving DOWN would require that as the initial move.

But wait, initial direction is set when you start moving. Wait no, in this problem, it's not specified how the snake moves; you have to choose the movement sequence.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that from (4,4), any first move except RIGHT is allowed, since current direction is undefined until moved.

Wait, actually, maybe the initial direction can be chosen freely. So perhaps I should consider that as a possible strategy: choosing an alternative initial direction.

But no, movement rules state you can't reverse directions on the first move. So if your first move is LEFT, next cannot be RIGHT; but if first move is DOWN, then next can be any except UP.

Hmm, maybe moving down initially allows more flexibility towards the apple's y=2.

So alternative approach:

1. First move: DOWN → (4,3). Now direction is DOWN.

Body becomes [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)]. Then, since no apple eaten, remove last element → body is [(4,4), (5,4)].

2. Next move: can't reverse direction from DOWN to UP. So options are LEFT or RIGHT or continue DOWN.

But moving further down isn't helpful as the apple is at y=2, which is above current y=3.

So perhaps:

Move 2: LEFT → (3,3). Check validity:

- Within grid.
- Body is [(4,4), (5,4)].
- New head not in body.

Proceeding:

- Insert old head (4,3) into front of body → [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4)].
- Since no apple eaten, remove last element → [(4,3), (4,4)].
- HEAD is now (3,3).

Move 3: LEFT → (2,3). Check:

- Validity.
- Body becomes [(4,3), (4,4)].
- New head not in body.

Proceeding:

- Insert old head (3,3) → [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4)].
- Remove tail → [(3,3), (4,3)].
- HEAD is now (2,3).

Move 4: LEFT → (1,3). Now at x=1. Check:

- Validity.
- Body becomes [(3,3), (4,3)].
- New head not in body.

Proceeding:

- Insert old head (2,3) → [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)].
- Remove tail → [(2,3), (3,3)].
- HEAD is now (1,3).

Move 5: Now at (1,3). Direction was LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT.

Options: LEFT or DOWN (since current direction is LEFT, cannot reverse to RIGHT immediately. Wait, movement rules say you can't reverse directions on the first move after a previous direction. So if current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT. But if moving from LEFT to something else, like DOWN, is allowed.

So at (1,3):

Move 5: DOWN → (1,2). Apple found!

Check validity:

- New head (1,2) not in body [(2,3), (3,3)].
- So valid move.

Proceeding:

- Insert old head (1,3) into front → [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3)].
- Eaten apple: keep body as is without removing tail. So body becomes [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3)].
- HEAD is now (1,2).

So this seems a better path:

Move 1: DOWN to (4,3)

Move 2: LEFT to (3,3)

Move 3: LEFT to (2,3)

Move 4: LEFT to (1,3)

Move 5: DOWN to (1,2) and eat apple.

Then, from there, manage the body by moving appropriately.

So this path uses 5 moves to reach the apple. Let me see if it's possible without collision:

- Move 1: From (4,4) down to (4,3). Body after: [(4,4), (5,4)]. Tail was (5,3), but moved back? Wait no.

Wait, initial body is [(5,4), (5,3)].

Move 1: DOWN → new head (4,3).

- Insert old head (4,4) into front: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)].
- Since didn't eat apple, remove last element (tail): so body becomes [(4,4), (5,4)].

HEAD is now (4,3).

Move 2: LEFT → new head (3,3). Check body [(4,4), (5,4)]. Valid.

Proceeding:

- Insert old head (4,3) into front: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4)].
- Remove tail: body becomes [(4,3), (4,4)].

HEAD is now (3,3).

Move 3: LEFT → new head (2,3). Check:

- Validity.
- Body becomes [(4,3), (4,4)].
- Insert old head (3,3): [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4)].
- Remove tail: body is [(3,3), (4,3)].

HEAD is now (2,3).

Move 4: LEFT → new head (1,3). Check:

- Validity.
- Body becomes [(3,3), (4,3)].
- Insert old head (2,3): [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)].
- Remove tail: body is [(2,3), (3,3)].

HEAD is now (1,3).

Move 5: DOWN → new head (1,2). Check:

- Validity. Body is [(2,3), (3,3)].
- New head not in body.
  
Proceeding:

- Insert old head (1,3) into front: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3)].
- Eaten apple: keep this body without removing.

Thus, successfully reached the apple at move 5.

So the sequence of moves is:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. DOWN

This should reach the apple without collision. Let me visualize the snake's path:

- Starting position: (4,4)
- Move 1: down to (4,3), body becomes [(4,4), (5,4)]
- Move 2: left to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (4,4)]
- Move 3: left to (2,3), body becomes [(3,3), (4,3)]
- Move 4: left to (1,3), body becomes [(2,3), (3,3)]
- Move 5: down to (1,2)

Yes, each move is valid and doesn't collide with the body. So this seems like a viable path.

I think this works.
</think>

The snake successfully reaches the apple at position (1,2) by following the sequence of moves: DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, and then DOWN. 

**Answer:** The snake can reach the apple in 5 moves by moving down first, then left three times, and finally down again.

$\boxed{\text{DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN}}$
