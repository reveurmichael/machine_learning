You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>We have to produce valid answer as JSON object with keys "moves" which is list of moves and "reasoning". We have a game state described. Let's re-read the problem statement:

"You are an AI agent controlling a snake in classic Snake on 10x10 grid. Coordinates range from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. You are given: head position: (5,5), current direction: NONE (so we can choose any move), body cells [] (empty list), apple at (5,0)." So the snake is basically a head with no tail. The apple is directly below the head by 5 cells? Wait, coordinates: Head position is (5,5) and apple position is (5,0). That means we need to move down 5 times. But careful: The movement rule says "cannot reverse direction", but current direction is NONE so that restriction doesn't matter for first move.

The moves: from head at (5,5), if we want to reach apple at (5,0) then we must plan safe path with minimal collisions etc. But since the snake body is empty, there's no risk of collision. The only possible hazards are walls boundaries and maybe reversing directions. Also "must not reverse direction on first move", but that means if previous direction was set, cannot choose opposite of it, but current direction is NONE so any move is allowed.

We must plan a safe path to apple at (5,0) from head at (5,5). There are multiple ways: simply go DOWN 5 times. But then check the constraint "Must not reverse direction on first move." That means if we want to go directly down repeatedly, that's valid because it's only one direction.

Wait but there is detail in problem statement: The snake dies if collides with its body or goes outside grid. But snake's body is empty. Also "Avoid hugging walls unnecessarily, especially near apple" so maybe a more direct path is safe enough. However the sample requirement: The total number of moves must match required net movement.

Given that head at (5,5) and apple at (5,0), the difference in x coordinate is 0 (5-5=0) so no net left/right difference needed; difference in y coordinate is negative 5 because we need to move down by 5. So we can simply do "DOWN" repeated 5 times.

But check constraint: "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." But since body becomes increased after apple eaten, but that doesn't matter for planning immediate safe path. Also need to consider "Plan a safe path avoiding collisions with snake body and walls". We can simply go down 5 times.

However, maybe the answer expects a different solution because it's a detour? Actually wait, check movement rule "If the direction is 'NONE', any move is allowed" so that means you can choose to start with any valid move. But if I just do DOWN five times from (5,5) then I'll get path: (5,6)? Wait careful: going "DOWN" means y - 1. Let's simulate:

Start at head = (5,5). If we do "DOWN", new head becomes (5,4), then next move "DOWN" gives (5,3), etc. But wait I must check coordinates for apple: Apple is at (5,0). So if we apply DOWN repeatedly, we need to do that 5 times. Let's simulate:

- At start: head = (5,5).
- Move 1: DOWN -> new position becomes (5,4).
- Move 2: DOWN -> new position becomes (5,3).
- Move 3: DOWN -> new position becomes (5,2).
- Move 4: DOWN -> new position becomes (5,1).
- Move 5: DOWN -> new position becomes (5,0).

Thus we arrive exactly at apple's position. So "DOWN" repeated five times yields a valid path.

But wait! Check coordinate details: Apple is at (5,0) and grid bottom row is y=0? Yes, it's allowed because bottom row is 0.

Additionally, check constraints: The snake moves always to new head and tail is removed if apple not eaten. But when apple is eaten, the body grows by one segment, meaning that in subsequent move after eating, you can't necessarily have a collision with itself? There's constraint "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." That means we must plan path so that after apple eaten (i.e., snake length increases) there is still at least one possible safe move from new head position. But here since it's only a single segment snake and apple being eaten will extend the body, but then the game state resets? Actually check the update rule: When apple is eaten, tail remains (so the snake grows by 1). And also if there is no legal move after eating, that would be dangerous because snake can't move. But given that grid is relatively large and snake length is short, one must ensure at least one adjacent cell from new head that is not blocked (i.e., not part of snake's body) exists after apple eaten.

We are in a trivial state: Body is empty (only head). When the apple is eaten, the snake becomes of length 1? Actually, wait, what happens exactly when apple is eaten:
- New head = current head + direction. Then head becomes body segment, and tail is removed unless apple was eaten (in that case, tail remains). So if we do a move downward:
Step by step: 
Initial state: snake has only head at (5,5).
After first "DOWN" move: new head becomes (5,4), old head becomes part of body. But the list of body cells is initially empty. So then after move 1, snake's full body becomes [head_old] maybe? Actually let’s simulate carefully:
At start: snake = [head], tail not present because it has no body?
But wait, problem says "body cells" are provided (excluding head). Given input, it's [].
So initial snake: head at (5,5), body segments none.

After move 1 ("DOWN"): new head becomes (5,4).
Now what is the new state? According to movement update:
- New head = old head + direction. Then the old head becomes a body segment. And tail is removed unless apple was eaten. But apple is not eaten yet because we haven't reached apple's position. So then tail is removed normally (but if snake only had one cell, there is no tail). So now snake becomes [body: (5,5), new head at (5,4)]? That seems reversed order maybe?
Actually typical snake simulation: The snake has a list of segments; the head is leading. After moving, the old head becomes the first element in body list. If there's no tail removal then the snake length remains same.

Let's check "movement update" explicitly:

Snake movement update:
- New head = head + direction.
- Head becomes body segment (so it is appended to beginning of body).
- Tail is removed unless apple is eaten.

So after first move: initial state: head (5,5), no body. After moving:
New head = (5,4). The old head (which was (5,5)) becomes a body segment. And tail is removed but since snake has only one segment, nothing to remove.
Thus new snake state: head = (5,4), body = [(5,5)].

Then after move 2 ("DOWN"): new head becomes (5,3). The previous head (which was now (5,4)) becomes a body segment. And tail is removed if needed. But then the snake's full state becomes: head at (5,3), body now includes previously head at (5,4) and also the old body remains? But wait, careful: the update is: snake = [head] + body where new head is appended to beginning of list that was not removed except tail. Let’s simulate:

After move 1:
Snake: Head: (5,4)
Body: [(5,5)].
Total length: 2 segments.

After move 2:
New head becomes (5,3).
Then the old head (which is now (5,4)) becomes a body segment appended to beginning of body list.
But then we remove tail if needed. But snake has 2 segments now; if no apple eaten, tail removal means removing last element in the sequence order (body list might be in order from head's previous positions) but it's ambiguous ordering though simulation is not necessary.

After move 5: new head becomes (5,0), and the body would become [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)] plus old head? Actually let’s recalc properly:

Let's simulate snake positions over moves:
State initially: Only head at (5,5). 
After move 1 "DOWN": New head = (5,4) ; body becomes [old head=(5,5)]. So snake occupies cells: Head: (5,4), Body: (5,5).
After move 2 "DOWN": New head = (5,3); then previous head which is now at (5,4) becomes a new body segment appended in front of the existing body list; so body becomes [(5,4), (5,5)]; tail removed? But snake length is now 3. 
After move 3 "DOWN": New head = (5,2); then previous head (5,3) becomes new body segment, and tail removal removes last segment of the current snake if needed to keep constant length because apple not eaten.
So after move 3: Snake: Head=(5,2), Body = [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)] but then tail removal would remove one at the end? But wait let's simulate in detail how the snake update works:
We have initial state with list representing body segments order that is "head" is separate and then body segments come after. At each move: new head = old head + direction; then old head becomes a body segment, and if apple not eaten, remove tail (last element). So after each move, snake length remains constant until eating apple.
Given initial snake: head: H0=(5,5), body list empty. But maybe we assume the snake always has at least one cell? Actually given input "Body cells: []", that means no segments aside from head. That is allowed.

After first move:
New head = (5,4)
Old head becomes body segment.
No tail removal because length=2 now, so new state: Head=(5,4), Body=[(5,5)].
After second move:
New head = (5,3) 
The previous head (which is at (5,4)) becomes a body segment. Now snake has 3 segments total if we don't remove tail? But rule says "Tail is removed unless apple eaten". So then we remove the last element from the body list.
So before removal: Body = [(5,4), old Body=(5,5)] but wait careful ordering:

We simulate in more detail:
Let snake be represented as a queue with head at front and tail at back? But instructions say "Head becomes body segment" so that means we add new cell to the beginning of the body list. And then if apple not eaten, remove tail from the sequence. So initial state: 
head = (5,5), body = [].
After move 1:
- New head = (5,4)
- Then old head becomes a body segment, so list temporarily [ (5,5) ]
- Remove tail? But since length of snake would be 2 if apple not eaten. We check: The snake should remain same length as before moving except for when apple is eaten.
But wait, "unless apple is eaten", then tail remains and length increases by one. Initially snake length was 1. After a move without eating apple, snake remains length 1? But that contradicts typical snake behavior where the snake moves forward with no growth, so length remains constant if not eating apple because head moves and tail moves accordingly.
But here initial state: head is only cell, so body = [] means there's no tail to remove. However, movement rule says "Tail is removed unless apple is eaten" meaning that normally you always remove the tail after moving (if there is a tail) but if snake length is 1 then nothing happens because there's no tail? Wait, let’s check typical snake simulation: When the snake moves without eating, it adds new head and removes last segment which is tail. But in our case, since body list only has segments excluding head, maybe we assume snake always has at least one body cell after first move if no apple eaten?
We need to simulate carefully:
Initial state: snake length = 1 (only head).
After first move without eating apple, new head is added, and then the tail is removed. But there is only one segment in the snake's total representation, so removal would remove that tail cell, but maybe it means no change? Actually, let’s re-read the movement update: 
"Snake movement update (per move):
  * New head = head + direction
  * Head becomes body segment
  * Tail is removed **unless** apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains)
"
So if snake has only one cell, then after adding new head and making old head become a body segment, we have two segments. But then if tail is removed, we remove one of them to keep the length constant. Which one is removed? Typically, in snake simulation, you add new head at front and pop tail from back (which is the last segment). So that means after move, snake remains same length as before move.
So initial state: length=1. After first move without eating apple, we will have two segments temporarily if we don't remove tail? But then we remove one tail to maintain constant length, so final state's length becomes 2. Let’s simulate:
Initial snake representation (for simplicity): list of positions in order from head to tail. Initially: [ (5,5) ].
After move "DOWN": 
- New head = (5,5) + (0,-1)? Actually direction DOWN means y decreases by 1 so new head becomes (5,4).
Now snake before removal: [ (5,4), (5,5) ]. Then tail removal means remove last element? But which one is the tail? In a typical simulation, the first element in list is head and the last element in list is tail. So then after move, we get [ (5,4) ] if we remove tail. But that would lose the old head.
Wait, I'm mixing up ordering conventions.

Let's define: snake state as list of segments with head at index 0 and tail at end (index -1). Initially, snake = [(5,5)].
Movement update "head becomes body segment" means new head is added to front. Then if not eating apple, remove the last element (tail) so that length remains constant.
After first move:
New head = (5,4).
Then temporary state: [ (5,4), (5,5) ].
Remove tail => remove last element? But then snake becomes [ (5,4) ] which is only one segment. That doesn't add any body segments.
But that's how typical snake simulation works when not eating apple: the snake moves forward and the tail moves forward as well. Actually wait, in typical snake simulation, if you move without eating, new head is added at beginning, and then the last element (tail) is removed from the end so that length remains same.
So initial state: [ (5,5) ]
After move "DOWN": 
New head = (5,4). Then add old head to list? But if we add it then remove tail, then snake becomes just new head only. That means the snake doesn't have any body segments because it never accumulates.
However, typical snake simulation: The snake always has at least one segment, so initial state is often considered as length 1 with no body? I'm confused.

Let's re-read movement update instructions:
"Snake movement update (per move):
  * New head = head + direction
  * Head becomes body segment
  * Tail is removed **unless** apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains)
"
It says "head becomes body segment", which implies the old head gets appended to a list representing body segments. But then it also says "tail is removed" meaning that if you have a snake longer than one cell, after moving without eating, you remove the last element in the snake's list of positions.

I think we don't need to simulate further because the concern about having at least one legal move after apple eaten is usually about not getting trapped due to body occupying adjacent cells. But since our snake is very short and grid is sparse (with no other obstacles mentioned), the safe move check probably only matters if there are walls or boundaries? There's mention of "grid" but not explicitly how many rows and columns are in grid; maybe it's like 10x10 or something.

Let’s consider simpler: The question asks: "What is the first move to make?" given that initial state has a single snake at (5,5) and an apple at (4,4). We want to get closer without risk. Options:
- Move up from (5,5) gets you to (5,4)? Wait, check directions properly: Directions are typically "up", "down", "left", "right". But the grid coordinates? If we assume standard coordinate system with top-left as (0,0) then increasing y means going down. But it's not specified.

Let's analyze relative positions:
Apple is at (4,4), snake head is at (5,5). The vector from snake to apple: apple - snake = (4-5, 4-5) = (-1, -1). That means the apple is diagonally up-left of the snake. But you can't move diagonally in a grid game with cardinal directions. So the snake must choose one of four moves: up, down, left, or right.
What are possible moves from (5,5)? 
- Up leads to (5,4)
- Down leads to (5,6)
- Left leads to (4,5)
- Right leads to (6,5)

Which of these is closer to the apple at (4,4)? Let's compute Manhattan distance if we assume grid movement with cardinal moves:
Distance from snake head to apple: |5-4| + |5-4| = 1+1=2.
Check each move:
If move up: new position becomes (5,4). Distance from (5,4) to (4,4)= |5-4| + |4-4|= 1. So Manhattan distance becomes 1.
If move left: new position becomes (4,5). Distance: |4-4|+|5-4|=0+1=1.
Other moves:
If move down: (5,6) then distance = |5-4| + |6-4|= 1+2=3. If move right: (6,5), then distance = |6-4|+|5-4|= 2+1=3.

So both up and left reduce Manhattan distance by 1. Which one is safer? Well, if you go "up" to (5,4), what are the adjacent cells that would become part of your body after subsequent moves? After moving up, snake head becomes (5,4) and the old head (5,5) becomes a body segment. That means now snake occupies (5,4) as head and (5,5) as body. Then next move if you try to go left from (5,4), you'll be going into where? Actually, let's simulate both possibilities:

Case 1: Move "up"
State after move:
New position: (5,4)
Body: [(5,5)]
Now apple is at (4,4). Next possible moves from (5,4) would include left to (4,4) which is apple. But then moving into apple square will grow snake length.
But are there any traps? The head is now at (5,4), the body segment behind it is at (5,5). If you move down from (5,4), that leads back to (5,5), but that's occupied by your own body if not removed? But then maybe that move is invalid. 
Wait, need to consider safe moves after apple eaten.
After eating apple at (4,4) when moving left from (5,4), what are adjacent squares?
Let's simulate:
After first move "up", state: head=(5,4), body=[(5,5)].
Now if we take second move "left": new head = (4,4) which is apple. So after that move, since apple eaten, the snake grows by one and tail remains.
So new state becomes:
Head becomes (4,4).
The previous head (which was at (5,4)) becomes a body segment.
And we do not remove tail because apple was eaten.
So then snake occupies: head=(4,4), body=[(5,4)] but also plus the old body? Actually, wait: Let's simulate properly:
At state before move 2: snake = [ (5,4) ] as head and [(5,5)] as body. In many implementations, you keep a list that always has at least one element for head and then possibly others for body.
After move "left":
New head = (5,4)+(-1,0)= (4,4).
Then add old head (which is now (5,4)) to the front of body list. And do not remove tail because apple eaten. So new snake state becomes: [ head=(4,4), body starting with (5,4) and then what? The previous body was [(5,5)].
So final snake positions become: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) ]. 
Now check if there is at least one legal move. What are adjacent squares to new head (4,4)? They are:
Up from (4,4): (4,3)
Down from (4,4): (4,5)
Left from (4,4): (3,4) but that's off grid if grid boundaries exist? But grid might be large enough.
Right from (4,4): (5,4). But (5,4) is occupied by body segment at index 1. Also possibly not allowed to go into self. So then legal moves are: up and down and left if within bounds. So likely there's a move available. But we need to check collisions with walls maybe? The question does not mention walls explicitly though.

Case 2: Move "left" first:
State after move "left":
New head = (4,5)
Body becomes [(5,5)].
Now apple is at (4,4). Then next move if we try "up": new head = (4,5) + (0,-1)= (4,4), which is the apple.
Then simulate: state after second move:
Head becomes (4,4)
Body becomes [(4,5)] and then previous body? Actually, similar simulation as case 1 but with positions swapped. 
But now what are adjacent squares to new head at (4,4)? They would be (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5). But (4,5) is occupied by your own body segment from before.
Which option gives a better chance for safety? We need to consider possible traps. 
After move "up", state: head=(5,4), body=[(5,5)]. The adjacent cells to head are: up from (5,4): (5,3) if exists; left: (4,4) which is apple but then that's eaten and becomes safe? Not sure.
After move "left": state: head=(4,5), body=[(5,5)].
The differences:
- In case 1, the snake's head is at (5,4) and its body is directly below it at (5,5). In case 2, the snake's head is at (4,5) with body to the right at (5,5).
Which one is safer in terms of available moves after eating apple? Let's check potential collisions:
For state after move "up": head=(5,4), body=[(5,5)]. If we then go left to eat apple, new head = (4,4). Then the positions become: head=(4,4), body becomes [(5,4)] and also previous body is still there? But wait, if snake length was 2, after move up it's 2. After eating apple, it grows to 3.
Let's simulate with coordinates explicitly:
Case "up" then "left":
Initial: head = (5,5)
After move up: new head = (5,4), and body becomes [(5,5)] if we remove tail? But wait, let’s decide on snake simulation convention. Typically, initial snake might be just the head if it's a one-cell snake. When moving, you add the new head and then remove the tail unless apple eaten.
So after first move "up":
snake positions = [ (5,4) ] because we add new head to beginning, but then remove tail? That would mean we lose the old head?
I need to recall typical snake mechanics:
- Initially, snake is one cell at (5,5).
- When moving without eating apple: New head is added at front. Then if length > 1, tail is removed so that length stays constant.
But for a one-cell snake, adding new head and then removing tail results in the same position? That doesn't work.
Maybe with one cell, you always add the new head and do not remove any tail because there's no body yet. So after first move "up", snake becomes two cells: [(5,4), (5,5)] where (5,4) is new head and (5,5) is old head.
Then if apple eaten on next move, you add new head but do not remove tail so length becomes 3.

So simulation:
Case 1: Move up then left.
After move "up": snake positions = [ (5,4), (5,5) ] with head at index0.
Now from (5,4), if we move left to (4,4) which is apple, then new head becomes (4,4). Then since apple eaten, do not remove tail. So snake becomes: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) ].
Now check adjacent cells from head at (4,4):
Possible moves: up -> (4,3); right -> (5,4) which is body; down -> (4,5) maybe free? left -> (3,4) maybe free. So there are moves available. But also need to consider if any move leads into self immediately.
Case 2: Move left then up.
After move "left": snake positions = [ (4,5), (5,5) ] with head at index0.
Then from (4,5), if we move up to (4,4) which is apple, then new head becomes (4,4). Since apple eaten, do not remove tail. So snake becomes: [ (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ].
Now check adjacent cells for head at (4,4):
Possible moves: up -> (4,3); down -> (4,5) which is body; left -> (3,4) free maybe; right -> (5,4) free? But wait, (5,4) might be occupied by the previous snake from case 1? No, not relevant.
Which one seems more "open"?
Let's check potential trap: In case 1, after eating apple, the snake positions are (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). The body is arranged vertically. That might trap you if you try to move left or up? Let's see:
For head at (4,4):
- If you move right: (5,4) is occupied.
- If you move down: (4,5) is not in the snake positions because they are (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)? Actually check: if moving down from (4,4), that's (4,5). But (4,5) is not in this list? Wait, our case 1 after eating apple: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) ]. So (4,5) is free.
- If you move up: (4,3) free.
- If you move left: (3,4) free.
So seems fine.

Case 2: After eating apple, snake positions become [ (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ]. For head at (4,4):
Possible moves:
- Move right -> (5,4): Is that occupied? No, because the body is (4,5) and (5,5). So (5,4) might be free.
- Move up -> (4,3): free.
- Move left -> (3,4): free.
- Move down -> (4,5): but that's occupied by body at index 1. 
So both cases yield similar options. Which one is "safer"?
The question likely expects: "up" move first because the apple is diagonally up-left from snake head, so moving either up or left would reduce Manhattan distance, but then you want to be cautious of your own body.
However, if we consider what moves are immediately safe from self-collision in the next turn? 
After initial move, the snake's new position is adjacent to its old head. That might cause a potential trap if not careful.
Let's analyze:
- If you go up first: head becomes (5,4). Then your body occupies (5,5) behind you. So if on the subsequent move, you try to reverse direction (i.e., move down), that would put you into your own body at (5,5). But since apple is at (4,4), going left from (5,4) is the intended plan. After eating the apple, snake grows and then might trap itself if no moves available.
- If you go left first: head becomes (4,5). Then your body occupies (5,5). That means if you try to reverse direction by moving right, that would put you back into (5,5). But again, the plan is to move up next to get apple. 
Which one might lead to a trap later? 
We need to consider "safe moves" after eating the apple: The snake's new head will be adjacent to its body in both cases.
Let’s check potential collisions with walls or boundaries if any exist:
The grid likely has walls at some boundaries, but we don't know them. But maybe it is an open field? Possibly not.

Maybe we consider that moving "up" first might be more natural because the apple is up-left relative to snake head. 
But which one gets you closer? Both get you 1 step away in Manhattan distance.
However, if we choose "left" as first move, then after that, from (4,5) your available moves would be: up -> (4,4), down -> (4,6) maybe free, right -> (5,5) is body, left -> (3,5). 
If we choose "up" as first move, then from (5,4) available moves: left -> (4,4), down -> (5,5) is body, right -> (6,4), up -> (5,3).
So both are symmetric if grid boundaries are not considered. But which one is more likely to trap you? 
Consider the following: after moving "up", your snake is oriented vertically with head at (5,4) and tail at (5,5). That means your body occupies a column. When you then try to get the apple by moving left, your new head will be at (4,4), which is adjacent diagonally to your body? Wait, check positions: after "up", snake = [(5,4), (5,5)]. Then if move left, new head becomes (4,4). So now snake becomes [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5)].
Now what are the coordinates relative to each other? They form an L shape: 
- Head at (4,4)
- Body segments at (5,4) and (5,5).
This means your body occupies two adjacent squares in a column along x=5. The gap between head and tail: The segment at (5,4) is directly to the right of head if you consider horizontal difference, but actually (4,4) to (5,4): that's one unit to the right.
Then tail is at (5,5), which is below (5,4). So your body forms a 2x? shape. This might trap you in some scenarios because if there is a wall to the left of head or above head, then moving up or left might be dangerous.
Now consider case "left" first: after move left, snake = [(4,5), (5,5)]. Then if move up, new head becomes (4,4). So snake becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)].
This forms an L shape rotated 90 degrees: 
- Head at (4,4)
- Body segments at (4,5) and (5,5).
Now the body occupies a row on y=5 with head below that row. That might be different in terms of available escape routes depending on boundaries.

Without additional info about grid boundaries or walls, we can't definitively say which is safer.
However, perhaps the intended answer is "up" because it's the first move that minimizes Manhattan distance to apple and doesn't immediately reverse direction relative to snake body. But wait, moving up results in head (5,4) and tail (5,5). That means if there is a wall or obstacle on one side, which might cause trap? 

Let’s simulate potential next moves after eating apple:
Case 1: After "up" then "left", snake = [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5)].
From head at (4,4):
- If move left: new head becomes (3,4). Check collision with body segments? They are at (5,4) and (5,5). That is safe if not adjacent to walls. 
- If move up: new head becomes (4,3). That seems safe.
- If move right: would go to (5,4) which collides.
- If move down: goes to (4,5) which is free? Actually (4,5) is not in the snake positions because they are (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). So that's safe too.

Case 2: After "left" then "up", snake = [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)].
From head at (4,4):
- If move up: new head becomes (4,3) safe.
- If move left: new head becomes (3,4) safe.
- If move right: new head becomes (5,4) safe? But wait, check collision with body segments: They are at (4,5) and (5,5). (5,4) is diagonally adjacent but not colliding if no rule about diagonal collisions. 
- If move down: would be (4,5) which collides.

So both cases provide similar options after eating apple.
Maybe the intended answer is simply "Up" because it's the most direct move that reduces Manhattan distance to apple. But note that the apple is at (4,4), and snake head is at (5,5). The difference vector is (-1,-1). So if you could move diagonally, that would be perfect. But since only axis-aligned moves are allowed, you have to choose either up or left first. Which one should you choose? 
Often in such puzzles, the recommended strategy is to not trap yourself by not reversing direction relative to your body. In a one-cell snake, there's no body constraint yet because there's only head.
But if we consider that after the move, the snake will have two segments, and then it might trap itself if it moves in a way that reverses its previous move. 
In case 1 ("up" then "left"): The first move is up; reversing direction (down) would be unsafe because tail is behind you, so down is not allowed anyway.
In case 2 ("left" then "up"): The first move is left; reversing it (right) would also be disallowed.
So both are similar.

Maybe we need to consider future moves: After eating the apple, the snake will have three segments. Which configuration gives more escape routes? 
Let's analyze the geometry:
For case 1 ("up" then "left"): snake positions = [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5)].
What are the relative positions?
- Head at (4,4)
- Body segment A at (5,4) is directly to the right of head.
- Body segment B at (5,5) is diagonally down-right from head? Actually (5,5) is one unit down and one unit right from (4,4). So it forms an "L" shape that's turned 45 degrees relative to axes. 
For case 2 ("left" then "up"): snake positions = [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)].
Here:
- Head at (4,4)
- Body segment A at (4,5) is directly above head? Actually (4,5) relative to (4,4): it's one up.
- Body segment B at (5,5) is to the right of that body segment and diagonally from head. So now the body forms a horizontal line on y=5 with the tail at (5,5) and the middle at (4,5), while the head is below them.

Which configuration might be more prone to trapping? 
Consider potential moves:
In case 1: Head at (4,4). The adjacent cells are: up: (4,3); right: (5,4) [occupied]; down: (4,5); left: (3,4).
So available moves from head: Up, Down, Left.
But note: if you move down to (4,5), is that safe? Check: body positions: (5,4) and (5,5). (4,5) is not occupied by the snake. But what about future collisions? Hard to tell without a simulation of subsequent moves.
In case 2: Head at (4,4). Adjacent cells: up: (4,3); right: (5,4); down: (4,5) [occupied]; left: (3,4).
So available moves from head: Up, Right, Left.
Which one might be more natural given the apple was originally at (4,4)? Actually after eating the apple, you don't need to move toward it anymore. But then what? Possibly you want to avoid reversing direction relative to your body.

The question doesn't provide additional context of walls or snake length beyond 1 cell initially, so maybe the simplest answer is: The Manhattan distance from (5,5) to (4,4) is 2, and since moves are axis aligned, either "up" or "left" will reduce that distance by 1. Which one should be chosen? 
Maybe you want to avoid reversing your previous move. But initially, there's no previous move, so it doesn't matter.
However, if we consider typical snake behavior, you wouldn't want to immediately reverse direction because then you'll collide with your tail. But since the snake only has one segment, reversing is not an issue yet.
Maybe the intended answer: "Up" because after moving up, your next move should be left to get the apple. 
But wait: if you choose "up", then from (5,4) you can move left and get to (4,4). If you choose "left" first, from (4,5) you would need to move up to get to (4,4), which is also possible.
Which one gives a better chance of not trapping yourself? 
Consider potential wall collisions. If there's a wall on the left side, then moving left might be dangerous. But we don't know that either.

Maybe the intended answer is simply "Up" because it is more straightforward: (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (4,4). That path has no reversal of direction and seems natural.
Additionally, if you move up first, your body will be behind you in a column, which might allow more options when avoiding self-collision later on. 
I recall that many snake puzzles suggest to always avoid reversing the previous move because it leads to collision with tail. But since initially there's no tail issue, it doesn't matter.

However, maybe we need to consider which adjacent cell is closer to the apple after one move. Let's compute Manhattan distances:
If you go "up": new head = (5,4). The distance from (5,4) to (4,4) is |5-4| + |4-4| = 1.
If you go "left": new head = (4,5). Distance from (4,5) to (4,4) is |4-4| + |5-4| = 1.
So both are equal.

Maybe consider Euclidean distance:
For "up": distance from (5,4) to (4,4) is 1.
For "left": distance from (4,5) to (4,4) is also 1.
So they're identical.

Since the apple lies diagonally from your head, you have two choices. Which one might be more favorable? 
I lean towards "Up" because then the subsequent move will be left, which gives a natural path that avoids immediate reversal since the previous move was up (and reversing would be down). In case 2, if you go left first, the next move is up. But then the snake's orientation might matter: after "up", in case 1, your body is oriented horizontally (tail to the right) whereas in case 2, your body is oriented vertically (tail above head). Which one gives more room? 
If there are walls, maybe having the body on the side rather than directly in front or behind might be advantageous.

Consider potential future moves: if you have a longer snake and you're trying to avoid collisions, you want to keep open space. The configuration after "up" then "left" (case 1) places your tail at (5,5) which is diagonally away from the head but might block movement in that quadrant. In case 2, after "left" then "up", your body occupies (4,5) and (5,5). That puts a segment directly above the head if you consider vertical alignment? Actually, check: head (4,4), then (4,5) is exactly one unit up. That might be more restrictive because moving further up would bring you closer to the tail.

I lean that "Up" is the safer move initially.

Thus answer: The optimal first move is "up". Therefore next_move = "up".

I will provide reasoning in plain text explanation and then final answer "up".</think>Fundamentally, you’re at (5,5) while the apple is at (4,4). Since moves are axis‐aligned only, you cannot go “diagonally” directly. The difference vector is (–1, –1), so you must make one move that decreases one coordinate and then a subsequent move to decrease the other.

Here’s one way to look at it:

• If you go “up”, your head moves from (5,5) to (5,4). Now the Manhattan distance from (5,4) to (4,4) is |5–4| + |4–4| = 1. Your next move can then be “left” to reach (4,4).

• Alternatively, if you go “left” first, your head goes from (5,5) to (4,5). The distance from (4,5) to (4,4) is also |4–4| + |5–4| = 1 and then a move “up” will take you to the apple.

Both options are equivalent in terms of immediate progress. However, many strategies advise avoiding an immediate reversal of your previous move because that can lead to a collision with your tail when your snake grows longer. (In this case your snake only has one segment so it isn’t an issue yet—but as soon as you add segments the “don’t reverse” rule becomes important.) 

Choosing “up” first sets you up for a subsequent “left” move without risking a reversal if, later on, other factors (like nearby walls or obstacles) come into play. In many snake puzzles and games the natural inclination is to “snipe” the apple by reducing one coordinate then the other in such an order.

Thus, the optimal first move here is “up”.

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (5, 0).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
