# Task-0 Core Refactoring for Extension-Friendliness

> **Status:** Updated Based on Heuristics v0.04 Implementation  
> **Priority:** High  
> **Impact:** All Future Extensions (Tasks 1-5)

## üéØ **Core Problem Diagnosis**

While the current architecture is strong and heuristics-v0.04 demonstrates successful extension implementation, further abstraction and standardization will make it much easier to add new extensions and ensure all outputs (game_N.json, summary.json) are consistent and robust.

---

## ‚úÖ **What's Working Well (Heuristics v0.04 Success)**

### **Architecture Achievements**
- **Base Class Architecture:** Clean inheritance, clear separation of concerns, and SOLID/DRY principles
- **Extension-Specific Data/Logic:** Extensions can add their own metrics, explanations, and round management without polluting the base classes
- **Dataset Generation:** Modular utilities and schema-compliant outputs (JSONL/CSV) with rich explanations
- **Forward-Looking Design:** No backward compatibility baggage; extensions are self-contained

### **Heuristics v0.04 Success Highlights**
- **Clean extension structure** with dedicated `game_rounds.py`
- **HeuristicRoundManager** properly extends base functionality
- **No pollution** of base classes with extension-specific code
- **Forward-looking design** with no backward compatibility baggage
- **Rich JSONL datasets** with detailed step-by-step explanations
- **Clean CSV datasets** with all required features
- **No redundant fields** (removed `natural_language_summary`)
- **Clear conclusions** in all explanations
- **Automatic incremental updates** after each game
- **Task-0 compatible** game logs
- **No dataset-specific pollution** in game files
- **Clean architecture** with proper separation of concerns
- **Canonical end reasons** without remapping
- **Robust error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Efficient data processing** with minimal overhead
- **Consistent behavior** across different algorithms
- **Scalable architecture** for future extensions

## üö© **Key Problems to Address**

1. **JSON/game summary generation is duplicated**: Each extension implements its own `generate_game_summary()` logic, leading to code repetition and inconsistencies
2. **Statistics collection is manual and error-prone**: Step stats, time stats, and other metrics are managed by hand in each extension
3. **File/session management is scattered**: Logic for saving game/session files is spread across multiple classes and not standardized
4. **Extension logic requires method overrides**: Extensions must override or duplicate methods to add custom logic at various lifecycle points
5. **Extension-specific data/config validation is inconsistent**: Each extension manages its own data/config validation, leading to inconsistencies

---

## üöÄ **Unified Refactoring Solution**

### 1. **Universal JSON/Game Summary Generator**
- Implement `BaseGameSummaryGenerator` (e.g., `core/game_summary_generator.py`) using Template Method/Strategy Patterns
- All tasks/extensions use this generator for summary creation, with extension-specific fields handled via subclassing or hooks
- Ensures consistency, reduces boilerplate, and supports Task-0 compatibility

### 2. **Standardized Statistics/Data Collection**
- Implement `GameStatisticsCollector` (e.g., `core/game_statistics_collector.py`) using Observer/Facade Patterns
- Automatically aggregates and manages all relevant statistics, with extension-specific collectors pluggable as needed
- Integrate with `BaseGameData` so all moves/game ends are recorded through the collector

### 3. **Unified File and Session Management**
- Create `UniversalFileManager` (e.g., `core/game_file_manager.py`) to provide a single API for saving game files and session summaries
- File manager uses the summary generator and stats collector to ensure all outputs are consistent and up-to-date

### 4. **Extensibility Hooks and Callbacks**
- Add a callback/hook system to `BaseGameManager` (e.g., `register_extension_callback(event, callback)` and `_trigger_extension_callbacks(event, **kwargs)`)
- Extensions register logic for events like `pre_game`, `post_game`, `pre_move`, `post_move`, and `dataset_update`
- The base manager triggers these hooks at the appropriate times

### 5. **Extension-Specific Data Storage and Validation**
- Add `extension_data` and related methods to `BaseGameData` for standardized extension-specific storage
- Implement `ExtensionConfig` and `ExtensionConfigManager` for standardized configuration validation

---

## üìã **Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1 (High Priority)**
1. Implement `BaseGameSummaryGenerator` and refactor all summary generation to use it
2. Integrate `GameStatisticsCollector` into `BaseGameData` and all extensions
3. Refactor file/session management to use `UniversalFileManager`
4. Add extensibility hooks/callbacks to `BaseGameManager`

### **Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**
5. Add extension-specific data storage and validation to `BaseGameData` and `core/extension_config.py`
6. Standardize data export interfaces for all extensions

### **Phase 3 (Long-Term)**
7. Add advanced monitoring, dependency management, and performance tracking as needed
