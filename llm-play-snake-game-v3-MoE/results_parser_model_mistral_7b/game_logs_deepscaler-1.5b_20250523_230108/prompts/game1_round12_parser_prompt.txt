Okay, I need to plan a safe path for the snake's head from (3,5) to eat the apple at (6,5). The current direction is "DOWN", and the body cells are given as [(3,6)]. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state. The snake's head is at (3,5), which is moving "DOWN" because the current direction isn't listed yet but from the input, perhaps it's determined by the next move. Wait, maybe I need to figure out the movement first.

The body cells are [(3,6)], meaning that after the head (3,5) comes body segment (3,6). But since it's ordered as [head, body1], the snake has at least two segments: head and body1. So the full snake S is [ (3,5), (3,6) ].

The apple is at (6,5). The movement rules say that if new_head coincides with any body except tail's current cell when moving, it dies. Wait, no—rule 2 says if new_head is outside or coincides with a body segment except the tail will move. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

The initial direction is "DOWN", but since the body includes (3,6), which is below the head's y-coordinate? Wait, wait. The head is at (3,5), and the next cell in the body is (3,6). That would mean that moving "UP" or something else?

Wait, perhaps I need to determine the initial direction first. Since the snake is moving down from (3,5) but has a body segment at (3,6), maybe it's actually moving up because the next cell in the body is higher y-coordinate? Wait no, because if the head is at (3,5) and the next cell is (3,6), that would be moving "UP" direction. But wait, the initial direction given is "DOWN". Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is determined by the movement from head to body1. Since the snake's S list includes [head, body1], which are (3,5) and (3,6), that means moving up because y increases? Wait no, wait: (3,5) to (3,6) is increasing in y, so direction would be "UP"? But initial direction given is "DOWN". This seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the problem as given.

The snake has a head at (3,5), body cells are [(3,6)], and it's moving down. The apple is at (6,5). So to reach the apple, which is to the right of the head, perhaps moving in the direction that allows the snake to extend its body towards the apple.

Since movement rules say that when moving, if new_head coincides with any body except tail when moving, it dies. But since we're planning a move now, perhaps we can proceed step by step.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The head is at (3,5), direction is "DOWN". So next possible moves are to go down further or adjust direction if necessary.

But wait, from the body cells given [(3,6)], perhaps the snake's length is 2: head and one body segment. Therefore, moving from (3,5) to (3,6) would be in a different direction than "DOWN". Hmm, maybe I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is not given yet because it's determined by movement rules. But since the problem says that the current direction is given as "DOWN", perhaps we can proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps the head is at (3,5), and it moves down to (3,6) which is part of the body. So perhaps the initial direction was actually "UP" because moving from (3,5) up would go to (3,4), but maybe not. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the movement rules and possible paths.

The snake's goal is to reach (6,5). The head starts at (3,5), needs to move right twice to get to x=6. Since each move can only change one coordinate by 1, moving right two times would take it from (3,5) to (4,5), then to (5,5), and finally to (6,5). But the snake's body might block this.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is "UP" because from (3,5) to (3,6) as part of the body. Wait no, that would require moving up, but the head is at (3,5), and if it moves up, y decreases by 1 each time? No, wait: movement directions are given as per coordinates.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's consider that the snake has a length of at least two segments because it starts with body cells [(3,6)]. So the head is (3,5), and the next cell in the body is (3,6). That suggests that moving from (3,5) up would go to (2,5), but perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with the steps:

The snake starts at (3,5), direction "DOWN". The apple is at (6,5).

To reach the apple, we need to move in the x-direction rightwards. Since each step can only change one coordinate by 1, moving from (3,5) to (4,5), then (5,5), and finally (6,5). But due to the body's position, which includes (3,6), perhaps we need a path that doesn't block.

Let me outline possible moves:

Option 1: Move right each time without changing direction. Let's see if this is feasible.

Step 1: From (3,5) moving "DOWN" would take us to (3,4). But wait, the initial direction is given as "DOWN", but perhaps in this case, since we are starting at (3,5), moving down would go beyond the grid? Wait no, because y=9 is the max. So moving down from (3,5) could be possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about each move step by step.

Since the snake's current direction is "DOWN", but we might need to change direction if necessary due to collision rules.

Let me try to plan a path:

1. Current position: head at (3,5), moving "DOWN". The next possible move is to go down further into y=6 or beyond, but perhaps not immediately because the body has other positions.

But wait, perhaps the initial direction isn't given yet because it's determined by movement rules. Alternatively, maybe we can proceed with moving right as much as needed, adjusting directions if necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is "UP" because the snake needs to extend its body towards the apple.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move right twice from (3,5) to (4,5), then (5,5), and finally (6,5). But we need to ensure that the body doesn't block.

But since the snake's body includes [(3,6)], perhaps moving into that area would cause issues.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is "UP" because from (3,5) up could go towards the apple at (6,5), but wait no, moving up decreases y, which would take us to (3,4), then down again. Hmm.

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to follow the movement rules and plan steps accordingly.

Given that the snake's direction can't reverse on first move unless it's "NONE", perhaps we need to adjust direction if necessary.

But let me proceed step by step:

1. The head is at (3,5), moving "DOWN". Let's see where this would take us.

If we choose "DOWN" again, new_head would be (3,4). But then, the body cells list has (3,6) as a segment before that. Wait, perhaps the snake's direction can't change unless it's allowed by movement rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is already given, and we need to adjust based on the body's positions.

This is getting too tangled. Let me instead consider that the snake needs to reach (6,5) from (3,5). So in x-direction, it needs to move 3 steps right. Since each step can be either right or up/down/left, but considering the movement rules and body constraints, perhaps moving right three times is possible.

But let's check for collisions:

If we move right each time without changing direction, the new_head would be (4,5), then (5,5), then (6,5). We need to ensure that none of these positions are occupied by the snake's body segments except possibly when moving into them.

Given the body cells [(3,6)], perhaps moving down from (3,5) is possible. Let's try:

Move 1: Move down to (3,4). But wait, the body includes (3,6), so this might cause a collision if the new_head is adjacent but not in the body.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move right first.

Let me outline a possible path:

Step 1: From (3,5) moving down to (3,4). But wait, let's check for collisions. The snake's body includes [(3,6)], so if new_head is (3,4), which isn't in the body yet except perhaps as a previous step.

Wait, perhaps it's better to move right first.

Let me try moving right each time:

Move 1: From (3,5) to (4,5). Check for collisions. The body after this move would have new_head at (4,5), and the body becomes [(3,6), (4,5)]. Wait no, because when moving, we remove the old head from the body.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement process.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for a path that extends the snake towards the apple without blocking itself.

Given that the initial direction is "DOWN", perhaps after some steps, changing direction to move right would be necessary.

But this seems too vague. Perhaps another approach: since the problem requires us to output movement commands, let's assume we need to move in such a way that each step brings us closer to (6,5).

Given that, perhaps moving right three times is feasible:

Move 1: Right → (4,5)
Check for collision: The snake's body includes [(3,6)], which is not adjacent. So no problem.
Then Move 2: Right → (5,5)
No collision with existing body segments except possibly the next one.
Move 3: Right → (6,5). Check if this position is free.

But wait, the new_head would be at (6,5), and since it's beyond y=9? No, because initial head is at y=5. Wait, perhaps moving down from (3,5) to (4,5), then again to (5,5), then to (6,5). But let's see:

If the snake moves in direction "UP" three times: but maybe that would be too far.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move right first and adjust direction if necessary.

But given the complexity, perhaps I need to outline a possible sequence of moves based on movement rules and body constraints.

Given that, let me try:

Move 1: From (3,5) moving "UP" would take us to (2,5). But let's see if this is allowed. Since direction isn't given yet, but perhaps we can adjust it.

Alternatively, maybe the initial direction is "DOWN", so first move down to (3,4), then proceed right.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach: since the problem requires moving steps and directions, perhaps list possible moves step by step based on constraints.

From the movement rules:

- When moving, if new_head coincides with any body segment except tail's current position when moving, it dies.
Wait, perhaps more accurately, rule 2 says that if new_head is outside grid or if it coincides with a body segment (other than the tail) during movement, it dies.

But since we're planning steps now, perhaps let's assume each move must not cause immediate death and adjust direction as needed.

Let me outline possible moves:

1. Move down to (3,4). Check for collision: The body includes [(3,6)], so moving from (3,5) to (3,4) would make the new_head at (3,4), which is adjacent but not in the body except as a previous step. Wait, perhaps no collision.

2. Move right to (4,4). Check for collision: The snake's body includes [(3,6)], so moving here might be okay unless it collides with any existing segment.

But this seems too vague without knowing exact movement steps and positions.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should consider that the initial direction is "DOWN", and we need to adjust direction if necessary because of the body's position at (3,6).

Let me try:

Move 1: Move down from (3,5) → (3,4). Now, new_head is (3,4), which isn't in the body yet. So it's safe.

But wait, perhaps moving down again would take us beyond y=9? Wait no, because initial head is at y=5.

Alternatively, let me consider that after each move, we need to ensure that the new_head doesn't conflict with any existing segments except for possibly being a previous step.

Given this complexity, perhaps it's better to look for a path that allows us to reach (6,5) without blocking the body.

Since moving right three times would take us from x=3 to x=6, which is needed. Let's assume we can move right each time without issues.

So possible moves:

1. Move down → Check if new_head is allowed.
But perhaps it's better to proceed with moving right first.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is "UP", and then adjust as necessary.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should outline a possible sequence of movements as follows:

Move 1: Right → (4,5)
Check for collision: The body includes [(3,6)], which isn't adjacent to (4,5), so okay.
Move 2: Right → (5,5)
Again, not in the body except perhaps previous step. Wait, no, because after moving right once, the new_head is at (4,5), and the body becomes [new_head]. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for a path that allows us to move right three times without conflicting with the body positions.

Since each movement step must not cause immediate death, perhaps moving in such a way that after each move, we have enough space in our body segments.

Given all this complexity, perhaps the answer is to move right three times: "RRR".

But let's verify:

Starting at (3,5), moving right each time:

1. Right → (4,5)
2. Right → (5,5)
3. Right → (6,5)

We need to ensure that none of these new positions are adjacent or overlapping with the snake's body segments.

Given that the body includes [(3,6)], which is at y=6, moving down would take us into lower y, but perhaps it's okay.

Alternatively, if we move down first:

1. Down → (3,4)
But then to reach (6,5), we might need more steps.

This seems too tangled without a clear path.

Given the time constraints and the problem's complexity, perhaps I should proceed with moving right three times as the solution.
</think>

The snake needs to move from (3,5) towards (6,5). Given movement constraints and body positions, it's best to move right each step. 

Step-by-step plan:

1. Move down first? Maybe not necessary if moving right is possible without issues.

But perhaps a better approach is:

Each move should be planned such that the new position doesn't interfere with existing segments except when needed for direction changes.

After careful consideration, the optimal path is to move three times to the right from (3,5):

1. Move Right → (4,5)
2. Move Right → (5,5)
3. Move Right → (6,5)

Thus, the commands are:

RRR

But considering possible movement rules and constraints, perhaps moving down first could be necessary if not blocked. However, given the complexity, the most straightforward path is to move right.

Final Answer:
RRR
