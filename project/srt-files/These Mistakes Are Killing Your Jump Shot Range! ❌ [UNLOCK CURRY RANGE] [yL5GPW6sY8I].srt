have our elbow in line with our body so
 

45
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,709
have our elbow in line with our body so
we're connected to the basketball with

46
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
we're connected to the basketball with
 

47
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,069
we're connected to the basketball with
our feet nice and wide so we have a good

48
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:41,079
our feet nice and wide so we have a good
 

49
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,229
our feet nice and wide so we have a good
stance now we're in the best position

50
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:43,239
stance now we're in the best position
 

51
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:44,910
stance now we're in the best position
possible to be able to move through our

52
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:44,920
possible to be able to move through our
 

53
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,990
possible to be able to move through our
shot later with in your preparation I

54
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,000
shot later with in your preparation I
 

55
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,549
shot later with in your preparation I
see a lot of mistakes when people have

56
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
see a lot of mistakes when people have
 

57
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,350
see a lot of mistakes when people have
their hand on top of the basketball so

58
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,360
their hand on top of the basketball so
 

59
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,590
their hand on top of the basketball so
their wrist isn't fully loaded and their

60
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:52,600
their wrist isn't fully loaded and their
 

61
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,910
their wrist isn't fully loaded and their
elbow is too far away from their body

62
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:54,920
elbow is too far away from their body
 

63
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,790
elbow is too far away from their body
this will cause issues later on within

64
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
this will cause issues later on within
 

65
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,670
this will cause issues later on within
your shot another issue I see is with

66
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:58,680
your shot another issue I see is with
 

67
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,229
your shot another issue I see is with
their arm away from their body so when

68
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
their arm away from their body so when
 

69
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,110
their arm away from their body so when
they get set up a lot of younger players

70
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,120
they get set up a lot of younger players
 

71
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,109
they get set up a lot of younger players
like to have the ball higher and further

72
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:04,119
like to have the ball higher and further
 

73
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:06,350
like to have the ball higher and further
away so now this will cause a pull

74
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,360
away so now this will cause a pull
 

75
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,109
away so now this will cause a pull
within your shot as well we want to get

76
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,119
within your shot as well we want to get
 

77
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,070
within your shot as well we want to get
nice and low bring that elbow back

78
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
nice and low bring that elbow back
 

79
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,870
nice and low bring that elbow back
aligning it with our body with our hand

80
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:11,880
aligning it with our body with our hand
 

81
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,030

the best way possible so if we get set

86
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:17,400
the best way possible so if we get set
 

87
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,070
the best way possible so if we get set
up in that proper position so we're

88
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,080
up in that proper position so we're
 

89
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,749
up in that proper position so we're
preparing ourselves with a chest up chin

90
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:20,759

spot we have now set ourselves up for
Success now we're flowing into our

96
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
Success now we're flowing into our
 

97
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,550
Success now we're flowing into our
second portion which is in how we move

98
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
second portion which is in how we move
 

99
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,950
second portion which is in how we move
now when we want to move the basketball

100
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:29,960
now when we want to move the basketball
 

101
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,710
now when we want to move the basketball
but we want to have the ball lead first

102
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:31,720
but we want to have the ball lead first
 

103
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,590
but we want to have the ball lead first
keeping our hips low so once we get to

104
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
keeping our hips low so once we get to
 

105
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,230
keeping our hips low so once we get to
our set point that's when we use our

106
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,240
our set point that's when we use our
 

107
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,230
our set point that's when we use our
legs common misconception people have

108
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,240
legs common misconception people have
 

109
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,590
legs common misconception people have
when it comes to shooting is they like

110
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:38,600
when it comes to shooting is they like
 

111
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,950
when it comes to shooting is they like
to think about everything being in one

112
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
to think about everything being in one
 

113
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,310
to think about everything being in one
motion it's less about one motion and

114
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,320
motion it's less about one motion and
 

115
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,270
motion it's less about one motion and
more about the order and how you move

116
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
more about the order and how you move
 

117
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,270
more about the order and how you move
within your shot so a lot of people mess

118
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
within your shot so a lot of people mess
 

119
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,149
within your shot so a lot of people mess
up because they get low and then when

120
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:49,159
up because they get low and then when
 

121
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,550
up because they get low and then when
they go to shoot everything raises up at

122
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:51,560
they go to shoot everything raises up at
 

123
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,950
they go to shoot everything raises up at
the same time your hips have a shorter

124
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:53,960
the same time your hips have a shorter
 

125
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,630
the same time your hips have a shorter
distance to travel than the ball does

126
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:55,640
distance to travel than the ball does
 

127
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,910
distance to travel than the ball does
from your hips to your set point also a

128
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
from your hips to your set point also a
 

129
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,910
from your hips to your set point also a
lot of people pull the ball away from

130
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
lot of people pull the ball away from
 

131
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,670
lot of people pull the ball away from
their body and then they have to bring

132
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
their body and then they have to bring
 

133
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,149
their body and then they have to bring
it back so we are trying to create One

134
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
it back so we are trying to create One
 

135
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,550
it back so we are trying to create One
Direction within our shot and move in

136
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
Direction within our shot and move in
 

137
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,430
Direction within our shot and move in
the proper way how we really want to

00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,440
the proper way how we really want to
 

139
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,029
the proper way how we really want to
move within our shot what we want to put

140
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,039
move within our shot what we want to put
 

141
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,390
move within our shot what we want to put
our focus on is getting low in that

142
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
our focus on is getting low in that
 

143
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,589
our focus on is getting low in that
proper position getting prepared right

144
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:14,599
proper position getting prepared right
 

145
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,390
proper position getting prepared right
now when we move we want the ball to

146
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
now when we move we want the ball to
 

147
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,309
now when we move we want the ball to
lead once we get to our set point now we

148
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:19,319
lead once we get to our set point now we
 

149
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,150
lead once we get to our set point now we
have stacked our power points on top of

150
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,160
have stacked our power points on top of
 

151
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,949
have stacked our power points on top of
each other this is where we are strong

152
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
each other this is where we are strong
 

153
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,470
each other this is where we are strong
at with our arms we're powerful here but

154
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,480
at with our arms we're powerful here but
 

155
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,390
at with our arms we're powerful here but
we also are powerful with our legs in

156
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,400
we also are powerful with our legs in
 

157
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,270
we also are powerful with our legs in
this position so we want to make sure we

158
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
this position so we want to make sure we
 

159
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,270
this position so we want to make sure we
stack both these on top of each other so

160
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
stack both these on top of each other so
 

161
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,750
stack both these on top of each other so
when we go up all the energy goes into

162
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
when we go up all the energy goes into
 

163
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,110
when we go up all the energy goes into
the basketball at the same time remember

164
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,120
the basketball at the same time remember
 

165
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,309
the basketball at the same time remember
this basketball has no power on its own

166
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
this basketball has no power on its own
 

167
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,630
this basketball has no power on its own
so it's all up to us on how we create

168
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
so it's all up to us on how we create
 

169
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,390
so it's all up to us on how we create
energy with the ball a common

170
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
energy with the ball a common
 

171
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,070
energy with the ball a common
misconception people have with this

172
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
misconception people have with this
 

173
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,110
misconception people have with this
thought process about shooting is they

174
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,120
thought process about shooting is they
 

175
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,190
thought process about shooting is they
think you have to get to your set point

176
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,200
think you have to get to your set point
 

177
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,430
think you have to get to your set point
and stay here and pause for a second or

178
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:50,440
and stay here and pause for a second or
 

179
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,470
and stay here and pause for a second or
two and then jump at the same time

180
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
two and then jump at the same time
 

181
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,190
two and then jump at the same time
that's not true it's about passing

182
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,200
that's not true it's about passing
 

183
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,910
that's not true it's about passing
through this point but letting the ball

184
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
through this point but letting the ball
 

185
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,309
through this point but letting the ball
move and lead to this point first so as

186
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
move and lead to this point first so as
 

187
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,550
move and lead to this point first so as
your low when the ball gets gets here

188
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
your low when the ball gets gets here
 

189
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,550
your low when the ball gets gets here
now it gets to about a set point as it's

190
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
now it gets to about a set point as it's
 

191
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,229
now it gets to about a set point as it's
still traveling that's when you start to

192
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
still traveling that's when you start to
 

193
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,509
still traveling that's when you start to
jump up and then extend into your shots

194
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:06,519
jump up and then extend into your shots
 

195
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,430
jump up and then extend into your shots
so you're not pausing down at the bottom

196
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,440
so you're not pausing down at the bottom
 

197
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,750
so you're not pausing down at the bottom
which some of you might need as a

which some of you might need as a
 

199
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,990
which some of you might need as a
beginner to introduce this but as you

200
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
beginner to introduce this but as you
 

201
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,949
beginner to introduce this but as you
advance on you no longer pause and you

202
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:13,959
advance on you no longer pause and you
 

203
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,789
advance on you no longer pause and you
just flow through that shot so our next

204
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:15,799
just flow through that shot so our next
 

205
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,710
just flow through that shot so our next
topic is in how we finish so if we've

206
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:17,720
topic is in how we finish so if we've
 

207
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,589
topic is in how we finish so if we've
prepared properly we've moved through

208
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
prepared properly we've moved through
 

209
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,270
prepared properly we've moved through
our shot in the best way now we need to

210
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
our shot in the best way now we need to
 

211
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,309
our shot in the best way now we need to
finish our shot so as we go to flick our

212
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:23,319
finish our shot so as we go to flick our
 

213
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,869
finish our shot so as we go to flick our
wrist we're want to finish with our

214
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
wrist we're want to finish with our
 

215
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,270
wrist we're want to finish with our
elbow above our eyebrow a lot of people

216
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
elbow above our eyebrow a lot of people
 

217
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,990
elbow above our eyebrow a lot of people
have issues with finishing the shot in

218
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,000
have issues with finishing the shot in
 

219
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,789
have issues with finishing the shot in
the correct place because they started

220
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
the correct place because they started
 

221
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,750
the correct place because they started
moving wrong in the first place so like

222
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:32,760
moving wrong in the first place so like
 

223
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,830
moving wrong in the first place so like
we said we want to start here move the

224
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:34,840
we said we want to start here move the
 

225
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,630
we said we want to start here move the
ball first pushing it up and then

226
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
ball first pushing it up and then
 

227
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,470
ball first pushing it up and then
getting to our set point a lot of people

228
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
getting to our set point a lot of people
 

229
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,630
getting to our set point a lot of people
like to start with the ball out and then

230
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
like to start with the ball out and then
 

231
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,710
like to start with the ball out and then
pull the ball in when you do that that

232
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
pull the ball in when you do that that
 

233
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,869
pull the ball in when you do that that
creates more of an opportunity for you

234
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
creates more of an opportunity for you
 

235
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,789
creates more of an opportunity for you
to just push the ball out at a flatter

236
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
to just push the ball out at a flatter
 

237
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,949
to just push the ball out at a flatter
angle we want to start low with our body

238
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
angle we want to start low with our body
 

239
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,630
angle we want to start low with our body
in the right spot push up to get here

240
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:51,640
in the right spot push up to get here
 

241
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,550
in the right spot push up to get here
now once we get our wrist underneath we

242
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:53,560
now once we get our wrist underneath we
 

243
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,270
now once we get our wrist underneath we
can finish our shot by pushing through

244
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
can finish our shot by pushing through
 

245
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,789
can finish our shot by pushing through
the middle flicking through our wrist

246
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
the middle flicking through our wrist
 

247
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,429
the middle flicking through our wrist
and finishing High remember the ball

248
00:03:58,429 --> 00:03:58,439
and finishing High remember the ball
 

249
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,110
and finishing High remember the ball
needs to do three things to go in the

250
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,120
needs to do three things to go in the
 

251
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,309
needs to do three things to go in the
ball needs to go up out and straight so

252
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
ball needs to go up out and straight so
 

253
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,229
ball needs to go up out and straight so
if we can follow through at the correct

254
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
if we can follow through at the correct
 

255
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,309
if we can follow through at the correct
angle that will ensure that the ball

256
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
angle that will ensure that the ball
 

257
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,069
angle that will ensure that the ball
does all three of those things so if we

258
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:08,079
does all three of those things so if we
 

259
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,190
does all three of those things so if we
can get our elbow to our eyebrow that

260
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,200
can get our elbow to our eyebrow that
 

261
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,190
can get our elbow to our eyebrow that
makes the ball go out but it also makes

262
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,200
makes the ball go out but it also makes
 

263
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,270
makes the ball go out but it also makes
sure it gets enough Arc to go Above the

264
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,280
sure it gets enough Arc to go Above the
 

265
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,350
sure it gets enough Arc to go Above the
Rim and then we just want to push

266
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
Rim and then we just want to push
 

267
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,789
Rim and then we just want to push
through the middle to make sure it goes

268
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
through the middle to make sure it goes
 

269
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,909
through the middle to make sure it goes
straight the last thing we're going to

270
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
straight the last thing we're going to
 

271
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,310
straight the last thing we're going to
dive into is how to properly practice on

272
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
dive into is how to properly practice on
 

273
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,990
dive into is how to properly practice on
how to increase your range a lot of

274
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
how to increase your range a lot of
 

275
