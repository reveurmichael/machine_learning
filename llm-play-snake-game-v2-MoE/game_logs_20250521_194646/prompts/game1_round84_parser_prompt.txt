Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the AI agent should move the snake to eat the apple without dying. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's look at the current state:

- The snake's head is at (1, 1).
- It's currently moving in the RIGHT direction.
- The body cells are a long list starting from (6,8) down to (0,1). So, the body seems to be coiling downwards and leftwards. Wait, actually, looking at the coordinates: (6,8), (5,8)... all the way to (0,8), then (0,7), etc., so it's a vertical line along x=0 from y=8 down to y=1. So the snake is long and wraps around on the left side.

The apple is at (7,6). The goal is to move the head from (1,1) to (7,6) without colliding with the body or going out of bounds, while ensuring that after eating the apple, there's still a safe path.

Constraints:

- Can't reverse direction. So since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.
- After moving, the head becomes part of the body, and the tail either shrinks unless an apple is eaten, in which case it grows by one segment.

So, the snake's path must avoid its own body at each step. Let me visualize the grid:

The snake's body is along x=0 from y=8 down to y=1. The head is at (1,1), moving RIGHT initially. So, after each move, the body segments shift towards the new head position.

Wait, but since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT because that's a reversal. So first move options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

But wait, the current direction is RIGHT, so the snake was moving right before this step. But in the initial state, the head is at (1,1), and the body starts from (6,8) down to (0,1). That seems confusing because if it's moving right, how did the body get all the way up?

Hmm, perhaps the movement history has been such that the snake moved up a lot, creating this vertical line on x=0.

But regardless, let me focus on planning the path from (1,1) to (7,6).

The apple is at (7,6). The head needs to move right 6 units and up 5 units. So the required net movement is +6 in x and +5 in y.

So the moves must have a total of RIGHTs - LEFTs = 6 and UPs - DOWNs = 5.

Now, considering the current direction is RIGHT, but after that, we can't reverse, so the next move can't be LEFT. So first move options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

But let's see what's in front of the head. If the head moves right to (2,1), does it collide with any body part? Looking at the body list: the snake is along x=0 from y=8 down to y=1, so moving right to (2,1) doesn't hit any body parts except perhaps itself in subsequent steps.

Wait, but when the head moves, the body follows. So after moving right, the previous head position becomes part of the body. But looking at the body list, does it include (1,1)? No, because the body is [(6,8), ..., (0,1)], so (1,1) is the head and not part of the body yet.

So moving RIGHT to (2,1) is safe initially.

But let's think about the path. From (1,1), moving right towards x=7 would be a direct path, but we have to avoid the snake's own body as it moves.

Wait, but if the snake continues moving right, will it collide with its body?

Because after each move, the body shifts. So let me think about how the body evolves:

- Current head: (1,1), direction RIGHT.
- Body is from (6,8) to (0,1). So when the head moves to (2,1), the previous positions become part of the body.

But since we're moving right, and the body is along x=0 on the left side, perhaps moving towards higher x values is safe as long as we don't run into our own path.

Wait, but after several moves to the right, the snake's body might start overlapping with its own path. So I need to plan a path that doesn't cause self-collision at any step.

Another approach: since the apple is at (7,6), which is far in x and y directions, maybe moving up first before moving right would help avoid the body.

Wait, but the current direction is RIGHT, so if we turn UP or DOWN on the first move, that's allowed as long as it doesn't reverse. So let me consider possible paths.

Option 1: Move UP first to (1,2), then start moving towards the apple.

But let's check what happens after each move.

First, current position is (1,1). If I move UP, new head is (1,2). Then next moves can be RIGHT or other directions. But we have to make sure that as the body follows, it doesn't collide with itself.

Alternatively, moving DOWN from (1,1) would take us to (1,0), which is on the grid edge. But then, the body might block further movement if not careful.

Wait, but the snake's body includes (0,8) down to (0,1). So after moving UP, the head is at (1,2), and the body will shift accordingly.

But perhaps a better strategy is to move right as much as possible because the apple is far in that direction. But let me think about how the body might block.

Wait, looking at the body list: it's [(6,8), (5,8)...(0,8), then down y-axis]. So the snake is forming a vertical line on x=0 from y=1 to y=8, and extends to x=6, y=8. That suggests that the snake was moving up along x=0 and then perhaps turned right once.

Wait, but how can the head be at (1,1) while the body starts at (6,8)? Because if the snake moved from (6,8) down to (0,8), then continued moving left, it would have a long tail on the left side. Then, perhaps the head is moving right again.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to sketch a possible path.

From (1,1):

First move options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.

Option A: Move UP to (1,2).

Then, from there, start moving RIGHT towards x=7, y=6.

But let's see the steps:

1. Move UP to (1,2). Now, body becomes [(6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,8), (0,7), ... , (1,1) becomes part of the body? Or does the head add a new segment each time.

Wait, no: when you move, the head moves, and then the body follows. So after moving UP, the new body includes all previous segments plus the old head.

So, initial body is [(6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,1)]. After moving UP to (1,2), the body becomes [(6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,2)] + [head's old position (1,1)], but wait, no—each move shifts all body segments towards the head.

Wait, perhaps each move appends a new segment at the head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten. But in this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so the tail should be moving as well.

Wait, no: according to the movement rules, after eating the apple, the body grows by one segment (tail doesn't shrink). So normally, each move causes the head to add a new position and the tail is removed. But if an apple is eaten, the tail isn't removed—so the body grows.

In this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so each move will shift the body: all segments move towards the head, and the tail is lost.

So when moving from (1,1) to (2,1), the new body will be [(6,8), ..., (0,1)] becomes shifted right by one? Or wait, no—each segment follows the next. So when the head moves RIGHT, each body part moves into the position of the previous one.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a list where each move appends the new head position and removes the last element (unless apple is eaten). But since we haven't eaten the apple yet, each move would shift the body accordingly.

But for planning the path, I need to ensure that after each move, the new head position doesn't collide with any part of the updated body.

So, initial body: [(6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1)].

After moving UP from (1,1) to (1,2):

- The new head is (1,2).
- The body becomes [(6,8), ..., (0,2), (1,1)]. So the tail at (0,1) is removed because we didn't eat an apple yet.

Wait no—each move shifts all body parts towards the head. So the new body would be [ (5,8), (4,8), ..., (0,2), (1,1) ], since each segment moves into the next position. Or perhaps it's that the entire body follows the head, so the previous positions are added to the body.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again:

When you move, the head moves in the direction. Then, each body part follows the path of the previous one. So if the head is at (1,1) and moves UP to (1,2), then the next body part (which was at (0,1)) moves into (1,1). The rest follow accordingly.

Wait no—the body is a list where each subsequent element is the next segment. When you move, all segments shift towards the head. So if the head is at (x,y) and moves to (x+dx, y+dy), then each body part becomes the position of the previous one.

So after moving UP from (1,1) to (1,2):

- The new body will be [ (6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,2), (1,1) ] plus the new head at (1,2). Wait no—because the movement adds a new position at the head and removes the last one unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, actually, when you move without eating an apple:

- The new head is added.
- All body parts shift forward by one, so each part becomes the position of the previous one.
- The tail is removed to make room for the new head.

So initial body: [B1, B2, ..., Bn] where B1 is (6,8), B2 is (5,8), etc., down to Bn being (0,1).

After moving UP:

- New head is (1,2).
- The new body becomes [(1,2)] + all previous body parts except the last one.

Wait no—when you move, the body follows. So each segment moves into the position of the segment in front of it. So the entire body shifts towards the head, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So after moving UP from (1,1), the new body would be:

[(6,8) becomes (5,8), (5,8) becomes (4,8), ..., (0,2) becomes (1,1), and then the head is at (1,2). But wait, that can't be right because each segment moves into the next position.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving up, all body segments move up as well. So the new body positions would adjust accordingly.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to model the snake's body after each move and ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any part of the updated body.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I can plan a path that moves the snake towards the apple while avoiding its own body.

Let me try to outline a possible sequence:

Start at (1,1), direction is RIGHT.

Possible first move: DOWN? Wait, no—because moving DOWN from (1,1) would take us to (1,0). But let's see if that's safe. The body after the move would include all previous positions except the tail, which is (0,1). So moving down to (1,0): does this collide with any part of the new body? Since the new body would be [(6,8), ..., (0,2), (1,1)], but the head is at (1,0). Does (1,0) collide with any body parts?

Looking at the new body after moving DOWN:

The head is at (1,0). The previous positions are [(6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,2), (1,1)]. So none of these are (1,0). Therefore, it's safe. But wait, moving DOWN from (1,1) would take us to (1,0), which is on the grid edge. Then, perhaps we can proceed.

But then, after that move, the direction changes to DOWN, but according to movement rules, the next move cannot be UP because that's a reversal. Hmm, but the current direction was RIGHT; moving DOWN isn't a reversal because the opposite of RIGHT is LEFT. So from RIGHT, the first move can't be LEFT.

Wait no—the initial direction is RIGHT. The possible first moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

So if I choose to move DOWN first, that's allowed.

But wait, when moving from (1,1) DOWN to (1,0), then in the next step, the current direction becomes DOWN, so the next move can't be UP. That might limit our options later on.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move UP or RIGHT first.

Let me try another approach: plan a path that moves up as much as possible before moving right, avoiding the body.

But given that the apple is at (x=7, y=6), which is far to the right and above, maybe it's best to move right as much as possible.

So first move: RIGHT to (2,1).

Check if this is safe. The new head is at (2,1). The body after moving will be [(5,8), ..., (0,1)], plus (1,1) becomes part of the body? Or no—because when you move right, all body parts shift towards the new head.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about how the body updates. To avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to assume that after each move, the body includes all previous positions except the tail, shifted accordingly.

Therefore, moving RIGHT from (1,1) would result in a new body where each segment is one step closer to the new head.

But given that the initial body is on the left side (x=0), moving right might cause the body to extend towards the apple without blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to move UP first to get out of the way of the body and then move right.

Let me try this:

1. Move UP from (1,1) to (1,2).

Now, check for collision: new head is at (1,2). The body becomes [(6,8), ..., (0,2)] plus [ (1,1) ], but wait, no—each move shifts the body.

Wait, perhaps after moving UP, the body would be:

[ (5,8), (4,8), ..., (0,2), (1,1) ] because each segment moves into the next position. So the new head is at (1,2), and the body segments are now from (5,8) down to (1,1).

Therefore, the new head is safe as it's not in any of those positions.

Then, next move: RIGHT to (2,2). Check for collision with updated body.

The body after moving right would be [ (4,8), ..., (0,2), (1,1) ] shifted again. So the new head at (2,2) is not in any of those positions.

Continue moving right:

3. Move RIGHT to (3,2). Check: safe.
...
Continue until x=7, y=6.

Wait, but we need to reach (7,6), which is higher than our current y=2. So after reaching x=7 at y=2, then move up towards 6.

But perhaps moving right as much as possible first would be better.

Alternatively, since the apple is at (7,6), maybe it's better to go diagonally: up and right alternately.

But I need to plan a specific path.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move UP from (1,1) → (1,2)
2. Move RIGHT → (2,2)
3. Move UP → (2,3)
4. Move RIGHT → (3,3)
5. Move UP → (3,4)
6. Move RIGHT → (4,4)
7. Move UP → (4,5)
8. Move RIGHT → (5,5)
9. Move UP → (5,6)
10. Move RIGHT → (6,6)
11. Move UP → (6,7)
12. Move RIGHT → (7,7)
13. Then move DOWN twice to reach y=6.

Wait, but that's a lot of moves and might involve unnecessary steps. Also, I'm not sure if the body will block some paths after several moves.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go straight right as much as possible:

1. Move RIGHT → (2,1)
2. Move RIGHT → (3,1)
...
Continue until x=7, then move up.

But let me see if this is safe.

After moving right from (1,1) to (2,1):

- New head at (2,1). Body becomes [(5,8), ..., (0,1)]. So (2,1) isn't in the body. Safe.

Move RIGHT again to (3,1): check if (3,1) is not in the new body, which is now [(4,8), ..., (0,1)] shifted right by one. Wait no—the body shifts such that each segment moves into the next position. So after moving from (2,1) to (3,1):

- The body segments become [ (5,8), ..., (0,1) ] shifted? I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps a better way is to model this as a list where each move appends the new head and removes the last element unless an apple is eaten.

So initial body: B = [(6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,1)]

Move 1: RIGHT from (1,1) → (2,1). New body: [ (6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,2), (1,1) ] but wait—actually, when moving right, the head moves to (2,1), and all body parts shift towards the new head. So the new body would be:

[ (2,1) ] + B[:-1] ?

Wait no—the body is a list of positions from tail to head. Each move shifts them.

Alternatively, perhaps the body is a deque where each move appends the new head and pops the last element unless an apple is eaten.

Assuming that, when moving without eating:

- New head is added.
- Tail is removed.

So initial body: [ (6,8), (5,8), ..., (0,1) ] plus the head at (1,1). Wait no—the head is separate. Hmm.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe for this problem, the key is to ensure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any of the body segments except the last one if an apple was eaten.

But since we haven't eaten the apple yet, each move removes the tail, so as long as the path towards the apple doesn't cross any previous positions (except possibly the last one), it should be safe.

Therefore, perhaps moving straight right is the most efficient way:

1. Move RIGHT to (2,1)
2. Move RIGHT to (3,1)
...
Continue until x=7.

But when we reach x=7 at y=1, then move up towards y=6.

Let me count the steps needed:

From x=1 to x=7 is 6 moves right.

Then from y=1 to y=6 is 5 moves up.

Total of 11 moves. Plus any possible adjustments if the body blocks the way.

But I'm not sure if this will cause the head to collide with the body after several moves.

Alternatively, maybe a better path is to move up first to get out of the body's way and then move right.

Let me try:

1. Move UP from (1,1) → (1,2)
2. Move RIGHT → (2,2)
3. Move UP → (2,3)
4. Move RIGHT → (3,3)
5. Continue this pattern until reaching x=7 and y=6.

This might take longer but ensures that the path is clear of the body.

But let's see:

After moving up to (1,2), then right to (2,2), etc., each time ensuring that the new position isn't in the updated body.

But since the body shifts with each move, as long as we're not crossing our own path beyond a certain point, it should be okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the safest way is to go straight up to y=6 first and then right, but given the apple's position, moving right is necessary.

I think I've thought enough and will proceed to outline a possible sequence of moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position (1,1) to the target position (7,6), avoiding collisions with its own body. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. Each move shifts the body segments towards the head, and if an apple is eaten, the tail doesn't shrink. However, since we haven't eaten any apples yet, each move will remove the last segment of the body.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (1,1). The body of the snake is a list of positions starting from the farthest point and ending just before the head.
2. **Movement Strategy**: To avoid collisions with its own body, the snake should move in such a way that it doesn't cross over any part of its body after each move. 
3. **Path Planning**: The goal is to reach (7,6) efficiently. A viable strategy is to move right as much as possible and then up to reach the target.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial position of the head
head = (1, 1)
# Initial body segments excluding the head
body = [(i, 8) for i in range(6, -1, -1)] + [(0, j) for j in range(7, 0, -1)]
# Target position
target = (7, 6)

# List to keep track of moves
moves = []

while head != target:
    # Calculate possible next positions
    possible_moves = [
        (head[0] + 1, head[1]),  # Right
        (head[0], head[1] + 1),  # Up
        (head[0] - 1, head[1]),  # Left
        (head[0], head[1] - 1)   # Down
    ]
    
    for move in possible_moves:
        # Check if the new position is safe and leads towards the target
        if move not in body and ((move[0] > head[0]) or (move[1] > head[1])):
            new_head = move
            break
    else:
        # If no valid move found, break the loop (though this shouldn't happen)
        break
    
    # Update moves list
    moves.append(new_head)
    
    # Update body and head for next iteration
    body.insert(0, new_head)
    body.pop()
    head = new_head

print(moves)
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The snake starts at (1,1). The initial body is set up from the farthest point to just before the head.
2. **Movement Loop**: In each iteration, possible moves are calculated in a specific order (right, up, left, down) to prioritize moving right or up towards the target.
3. **Safety Check**: Each potential move is checked against the current body segments to ensure it doesn't collide with itself.
4. **Update Position**: Once a safe move is found, the head is updated, and the body shifts accordingly by removing the last segment.

This approach ensures that the snake moves efficiently towards the target while avoiding collisions with its own body.
