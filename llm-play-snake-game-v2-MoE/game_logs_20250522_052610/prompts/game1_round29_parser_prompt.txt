Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is currently at (4,2) and needs to reach the apple at (8,3). The current direction is UP, and the body cells are [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]. 

First, I need to figure out the path from the head to the apple without colliding with the body or going outside the grid. Since the snake can't reverse direction immediately, the first move can't be DOWN because it's currently moving UP.

Looking at the movement rules, the snake can only change direction by turning left or right, not reversing. So from UP, possible next directions are LEFT or RIGHT. But wait, the current direction is UP, so after the first move, I can't go DOWN. Wait, no—the rule says you can't reverse direction on the first move if the direction isn't NONE. Since the current direction is UP, the first move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or maybe even UP again (though that would be staying in place). But since we need to move towards the apple, which is at x=8 and y=3, moving UP initially might not be helpful.

Wait, the head is at (4,2), and the apple is at (8,3). So the snake needs to move right by 4 units and up by 1 unit. The Manhattan distance suggests a path that prioritizes moving right as much as possible while avoiding obstacles.

Now, looking at the body cells: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]. These are behind the head, so when moving forward, the snake's body will shift. So I need to ensure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body.

Let me visualize the grid. The snake is at (4,2), and the apple is at (8,3). To get there, the snake needs to move right several times and up once. But the current direction is UP, so the first move can't be DOWN. So possible first moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

If I choose to move RIGHT first, that would take the head to (5,2), which is currently occupied by the body cell (5,2). Wait, no—because when moving, the body shifts. The current body cells are [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)], so after moving, the head becomes the new position, and each body part moves forward. But in this case, since we're moving right, the next cell is (5,2), which is already a body cell. That would cause collision.

So moving RIGHT first isn't possible because it's blocked by the body. Alternatively, moving LEFT from UP would take the head to (3,2). Let's see if that's safe. From (4,2) moving LEFT to (3,2), which is empty as per the current body cells. That seems okay.

Wait, but after moving left, the next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse direction, right? Or wait—the movement rules say you can't reverse direction on the first move unless it's NONE. So in this case, since the current direction is UP, and I'm changing to LEFT for the first move, that's allowed.

After moving left to (3,2), the next directions could be up or down, but let's plan a path that gets us to (8,3). Alternatively, maybe moving up first would allow us to move right more freely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider possible paths.

Option 1: Move RIGHT to (5,2), but that's blocked by the body, so can't do that immediately.

Option 2: Move UP to (4,3). Is that safe? The current direction is UP, and moving up would take us to (4,3). Let's check if that's within grid bounds. Since y ranges from 0 to 9, yes, it's valid. Now, after moving up, the new head is (4,3), and the body becomes [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] shifted. Wait no—the body cells are [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)], so when the head moves up to (4,3), the body will shift as follows: (5,2) becomes (5,3), but wait that's not correct because movement is per direction.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about how the snake moves. When the head moves in a direction, each body segment follows the next one. So for example, if the head moves up to (4,3), then the first body cell (5,2) would move to where the head was, but wait no—the movement is that each body part moves into the position of the previous one.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the snake's body updates after a move. When the head moves, each segment follows. So if the head is at (4,2), and it moves up to (4,3), then the body cells [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] would shift as follows:

- The new head is (4,3).
- The first body cell (5,2) becomes where the head was: (4,2).
- Then, the next body cell (5,1) moves to (5,2), and so on.
- So after moving up, the body cells would be [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)], but wait that doesn't make sense because each segment follows.

Wait no—actually, when the head moves, each body cell takes the position of the previous one. So if the head is at H and moves to H', then the first body part B1 moves to H, B2 moves to B1's old position, etc. If the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move.

So in this case, after moving up from (4,2) to (4,3), the new body cells would be [(5,2) → (4,2), (5,1) → (5,2), (4,1) → (5,1)]. So the new body is [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)].

Wait, but that's conflicting because (4,3) is now the head, and (4,2) is part of the body. But in this case, moving up to (4,3) would have the body including (4,2), which is adjacent but not overlapping. So it's safe.

But wait, after moving up, the new head is at (4,3). The previous head was at (4,2), which is now part of the body. So as long as we don't move back into that position, we're okay.

So perhaps moving UP first is possible. Then from (4,3), the next moves can be RIGHT towards (8,3).

But let's check the required movement counts. The snake needs to have 4 more RIGHT moves than LEFT and 1 more UP than DOWN.

If I move UP once to (4,3), then I need to make sure that overall, after all moves, the total RIGHTs minus LEFTs is 4, and UPs minus DOWNs is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to plan a path that goes right several times and up once, ensuring that we don't collide with the body.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let's list all possible moves step by step.

Current head: (4,2), direction UP, body at [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)].

Possible first moves:

- Move RIGHT to (5,2). But that cell is occupied by the body cell (5,2). So collision—can't do that.
- Move LEFT to (3,2). That's safe because it's not in the body cells. After moving left, the new head is (3,2), direction becomes LEFT (since we moved from UP to LEFT without reversing? Wait no—the initial direction is UP; after first move, can't reverse. So moving LEFT is allowed because it's a 90-degree turn.

Wait, actually, the movement rules say you can't reverse direction on the first move unless direction was NONE. Since current direction is UP, first move cannot be DOWN. So from UP, possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.

So after moving left to (3,2), the new direction is LEFT.

Now, next moves:

From (3,2), direction LEFT—can't reverse, so next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves: UP or DOWN.

But wait, I'm not sure about that because after changing direction once, you can change again as long as it's not reversing. So from LEFT, you can go UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

Wait no—the rule says you cannot reverse direction. Reversing would mean going in the opposite direction of your current movement. But since we're moving LEFT now, the next move can't be RIGHT, which is the opposite. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.

So from (3,2), moving UP to (3,3). Is that safe? The body after first move would be:

- After first move: head at (3,2), direction LEFT.
- Body cells become [(4,2), (5,1), (4,1)]—wait no, because when you move, each body cell follows. So initial body is [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]. After moving left to (3,2), the new head is (3,2). The previous head was at (4,2), which becomes part of the body.

So the new body cells after first move would be [(4,2), (5,1), (4,1)], but wait no—each body cell moves to where the previous one was. So initial body is [B0=(5,2), B1=(5,1), B2=(4,1)]. After moving left to H'=(3,2):

- B0 moves to H's old position: (4,2).
- B1 moves to B0's old position: (5,2).
- B2 moves to B1's old position: (5,1).

So the new body is [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)].

Wait no—no. When the head moves, each body part takes the place of the previous one. So:

H was at (4,2) moving to H'=(3,2).
B0 (5,2) → moves to (4,2).
B1 (5,1) → moves to B0's old position: (5,2).
B2 (4,1) → moves to B1's old position: (5,1).

So after first move, the body is [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. So H'=(3,2), body cells are [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)].

So from H'=(3,2), direction LEFT. Now, moving UP to (3,3). Let's check if that's safe. The body after second move would be:

- New head is (3,3).
- B0 moves to (3,2) → which was the previous head.
- B1 moves to B0's old position: (4,2).
- B2 moves to B1's old position: (5,2).

So body cells are [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2)]. So H'=(3,3) is not in the body. Safe.

But moving UP from (3,2) would take us away from the apple at (8,3). We need to move rightwards. Maybe a better approach is to move down first or find another path.

Alternatively, perhaps moving up once and then right multiple times.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach.

Let me calculate the required number of moves. From (4,2) to (8,3):

x needs to increase by 4, so RIGHT moves minus LEFT moves = 4.

y needs to increase by 1, so UP moves minus DOWN moves = 1.

So total moves: at least 5, but considering the body and path, perhaps more.

Another idea is to plan a direct path towards the apple without any detours. But given the initial position and direction, that might be tricky.

Let me consider moving up first to (4,3). That's safe because it's not in the body cells (body is at (5,2), etc.). After moving up, the body shifts:

- H moves from (4,2) → (4,3).
- B0 (5,2) → (4,2).
- B1 (5,1) → (5,2).
- B2 (4,1) → (5,1).

So new body cells are [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)].

Now, from (4,3), the next move can't be DOWN because that would reverse direction. So possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT or UP.

Moving right to (5,3) is safe? Let's check. Body cells after moving up are [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. The new head is at (4,3). If I move right to (5,3), that cell isn't in the body yet. So it's safe.

After moving right:

- H moves from (4,3) → (5,3).
- B0 (4,2) → (4,3).
- B1 (5,2) → (4,2).
- B2 (5,1) → (5,2).

So body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)].

Now, from (5,3), the next move can't be LEFT. So possible moves: UP or RIGHT or DOWN.

But wait, we need to go towards (8,3), so moving right again would help.

So let's move right to (6,3). Is that safe? The body after second move is [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)], but I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to plan the moves as follows:

Move 1: LEFT from (4,2) → (3,2).

But wait, moving left from UP isn't allowed because you can't reverse direction. Wait no—initial direction is UP; after first move, direction changes to LEFT, which is allowed.

Wait, the rule says you cannot reverse direction on the first move. Reversing would mean going back in the opposite direction of your current movement. So if you're moving UP and decide to go DOWN, that's reversing and not allowed on the first move.

But moving from UP to LEFT or RIGHT is allowed because it's a 90-degree turn, not a reversal.

So after moving left to (3,2), direction is now LEFT.

Next moves:

Move 2: Move UP to (3,3). Now, we're at (3,3) with body cells [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)].

But this seems like a detour. Let's try moving down instead.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first is better.

Move 1: Move UP to (4,3). Safe.

Move 2: Move RIGHT to (5,3). Safe.

Now, from (5,3), direction is RIGHT.

Next moves:

Move 3: Move RIGHT to (6,3).

Move 4: Move RIGHT to (7,3).

Move 5: Move RIGHT to (8,3).

So total moves: 5.

But let's check if all these positions are safe after each move.

After Move 1: H=(4,3), body=[(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)].

Wait no—after moving up, the body cells shift as follows:

Initial body: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)].

After moving up to (4,3):

- B0 moves to (4,2).
- B1 moves to (5,2).
- B2 moves to (5,1).

So new body is [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)].

Move 2: Move right from (4,3) → (5,3). Safe because (5,3) isn't in the body.

After move 2:

- H=(5,3).
- B0 moves to (4,3).
- B1 moves to (4,2).
- B2 moves to (5,2).

So new body is [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)].

Move 3: Move right from (5,3) → (6,3). Safe because body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2)]. So (6,3) is not occupied.

After move 3:

- H=(6,3).
- B0 moves to (5,3).
- B1 moves to (4,3).
- B2 moves to (4,2).

Body: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)].

Move 4: Move right from (6,3) → (7,3). Safe.

After move 4:

- H=(7,3).
- B0 moves to (6,3).
- B1 moves to (5,3).
- B2 moves to (4,3).

Body: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3)].

Move 5: Move right from (7,3) → (8,3). Safe.

After move 5:

- H=(8,3).
- B0 moves to (7,3).
- B1 moves to (6,3).
- B2 moves to (5,3).

Body: [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3)].

So all moves are safe and result in the required displacement of RIGHT 4 and UP 1. So this is a valid path.

But wait, the initial direction was UP; after moving up once, we changed direction to RIGHT. Then continued moving right four times. That's acceptable because each move only changes direction if necessary, without reversing.

So the sequence would be:

UP (move 1), then RIGHT ×4 (moves 2-5).

But wait, let me recount the moves. Move 1 is UP, which uses one UP and no DOWN, so total UPs =1, DOWNs=0. Then four RIGHTs: so RIGHTs=4, LEFTs=0.

Thus, UP - DOWN =1, RIGHT - LEFT=4. So satisfies the condition.

Therefore, this sequence works.
</think>

The optimal sequence of moves to reach the target while avoiding collisions is as follows:

UP → RIGHT × 4

This ensures that you end up at (8,3) with the correct number of directional changes without hitting any part of your body. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. **Move UP**: From (4,2) to (4,3). Body shifts safely.
2. **Move RIGHT four times**: Each move is safe and progresses towards the target.

Final answer:

\boxed{\text{UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT}}
```
