========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to get the snake from (8,5) to eat the apple at (8,6). Let's look at the given information.

The current head is at (8,5), and the body cells are [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. The direction is "UP", but I can't reverse, so I can't go DOWN immediately. Wait, no—the current direction is "UP", which means the snake was moving upwards before this step. So according to movement rules, I can't choose the opposite direction on the next move. Therefore, my first move cannot be "DOWN".

The apple is at (8,6), which is directly above the head. Since the snake's body is behind it, I need to check if moving up would cause a collision.

Looking at the body cells: [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. The next segment after the head is (8,4). So if I move up to (8,6), that's two steps. Wait, no—each move is one step. So the new head would be (8,6) if I move UP from (8,5).

But wait, the current body cells are [(8,4), ...], which is directly below the head. If I move UP to (8,6), that's a safe position because it's not part of the body except perhaps when considering the tail movement.

Wait, the body list is from BODY1 to BODYN. So in this case, BODY1 is (8,4). The tail is at (7,2). When I move up, new_head is (8,6). Now, check if new_head collides with anyBODYi except possibly the tail's current position when it moves.

In this case, after moving, the body would shift. So the old head becomes part of the body. The body list before movement is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. After inserting the old head, it becomes [ (8,5) ] + [ ... ]. Wait no—the step says to insert the old head at front of the BODY list.

So after moving, new_head is (8,6). The body before movement is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. After inserting the old head (which was (8,5)), the body becomes [ (8,5) ] + existing body. But wait, no—the initial body list is from BODY1 to BODYN, which are behind the head.

Wait, in movement step 3a: Insert the old head position at front of the BODY list. So after moving, the new body would be [old_head] followed by current BODY list.

So when I move UP:

new_head = (8,6).

Check collision: is (8,6) in any of the BODY cells? The body before movement is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. So no, (8,6) isn't part of the current body.

But after inserting old_head (8,5) into the body list, the new_body becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ].

Wait, but during collision check, we only consider the state before body shifts. So in step 2: Check if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

In this case, after moving up, new_head is (8,6). The current BODY cells are [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. So none of these except perhaps (8,5) if it's part of the body. Wait no—the old head is not yet part of the body during this check.

So collision check is safe because new_head (8,6) isn't in any current BODYi. Also, the apple is at (8,6), so moving up would eat it.

Then, since we ate the apple, step 3b: grow—don't remove the tail.

So the body after eating becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ] plus the new head is added, making the full snake as [ (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ].

Wait, no. Let me think again. The body list before movement is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. Inserting the old head at front makes it [ (8,5) ] followed by these. So after inserting, the new body list becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ]. Then, since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So the new body remains as [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ].

Wait, but after eating, do I add a new segment? Or is it that when I eat, I insert the old head and don't remove the tail. So the body becomes longer by one.

So in this case, moving UP would result in the snake growing to length 6 (since original body was 4 segments plus head).

Now, after eating, the next move must have at least one legal direction. Let's see what happens next.

But since I'm only required to plan up to eating the apple, maybe just one move is sufficient here.

So moving UP seems safe because it leads directly to the apple without collision.
</think>

The snake can safely eat the apple by moving "UP". This move doesn't cause any collisions and allows the snake to grow. 

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP"],
  "reasoning": "Moving UP from (8,5) to (8,6) is safe as it directly reaches the apple without causing any collisions."
}
```
```

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (8, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (8, 6). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
