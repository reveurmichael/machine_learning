========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where my snake's head is at (7,8) and it needs to reach the apple at (2,8). The snake can't reverse direction on its first move. Let me think through how to plan the path.

First, the snake's current position is (7,8), facing UP. Since I can't reverse direction right away, my first move has to be either LEFT or RIGHT because moving DOWN would make it face a different way, but wait—no, the initial direction is UP, so the next move cannot be DOWN if we're following rule 3 correctly. Wait no, rule 3 says you can't reverse direction, meaning from UP, you can only move to LEFT, RIGHT, or stay in place (NONE). So for the first move after being at (7,8) facing UP, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

But if I go RIGHT, that would take me towards increasing x, which is away from the apple's x of 2. That might not be efficient. If I go LEFT, that takes me to (6,8), moving closer to x=2. But then after that, can I continue moving LEFT? Let's see: each move affects the head.

Wait, but if the snake moves LEFT, its body would shift every step. So starting at (7,8) facing UP. If it moves LEFT to (6,8), the next position is (5,8), and so on until x=2. But I also need to check for collisions with the body.

Wait, initially, the only body cell is at (7,7). So moving LEFT from (7,8) would go to (6,8), which isn't blocked yet except by the body if any of those cells are already occupied. Since the snake's body is only at (7,7), it doesn't affect (6,8).

So step 1: move LEFT to (6,8). Now the snake's head is at (6,8), and its body will shift to include where it was before except for the new head.

Next, I can again move LEFT because it didn't reverse. So now moving to (5,8). Then again, same direction—LEFT to (4,8), then to (3,8), then to (2,8), which is the apple's position.

Wait, but how does that work? The snake's body would have shifted each time. After the first move, the body was at (7,7) and now includes (6,8). Then when moving LEFT again, the new head is (5,8), so the tail would drop unless it eats the apple.

But if I continue moving LEFT without eating the apple, after a few steps, will the snake collide with its own body? Let me see: each time the snake moves, the head goes to the next position and the tail is removed. So after moving LEFT multiple times, does any of those new positions coincide with existing body parts?

Wait, in this case, since I start at (7,8), move LEFT to (6,8). The body was only at (7,7) before that move; now it's shifting behind as the snake moves. So when moving from (7,8) to (6,8), the tail is removed—since we didn't eat anything—the next positions will be along x decreasing by 1 each time.

But let me check step-by-step:

Initial state:
Head: (7,8)
Body: [(7,7)]
Apple: (2,8)

Move LEFT to (6,8). New head is (6,8), body shifts so it's now at (7,7) and the next positions. Wait no, when a move happens:

- The new head becomes (new_x, new_y).
- Then, the body segments shift—each segment moves behind the previous one.

But in this case, since there was only the head initially beyond the body, after moving LEFT once, the tail is at (7,7), and the new head is (6,8). The next move would then be to move to (5,8), with the tail shifting from (6,8) to ... Wait no—each move appends a new segment as the head moves.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each step:

1. Initial position:
   - Head: (7,8)
   - Body: [(7,7)]
   
2. Move LEFT from (7,8) to (6,8):
   - New head is (6,8)
   - The tail was at (7,7), which becomes the new body's second segment.
   So after this move:
   - Head: (6,8)
   - Body: [(7,7), (6,8)]
   
Wait no—that can't be right because each time you move, only one cell is added to the tail. Wait perhaps it's that when moving, the head moves, and then the body follows in order.

Actually, in most snake games, after moving, the new head is at the previous head position plus movement vector, and the rest of the body follows. So each step adds a new segment at the end as the old tail.

Wait perhaps I should model it as:

Each time you move, the new head is added to the front of the body list, and the last element (tail) is removed unless the move results in eating food.

But in this case, since we're not eating anything, each step would just shift the entire body backward by one.

So initial steps:

- Head: (7,8)
- Body: [A], where A is (7,7)

After moving LEFT:
- New head at (6,8)
- Body becomes [(7,7), ... ? Wait no—it's a list of all previous positions. Or perhaps the body includes only the segments behind.

Wait maybe it's simpler to model that each move adds a new segment as the head moves, and removes the tail unless food is eaten.

So initial:

Body: [ (7,8) ]

After moving LEFT:
- New head at (6,8)
- Body becomes [ (6,8), ... ? Or just appends, but in reality, each step adds a new segment as the head moves forward and the old tail is removed if no food.

Wait perhaps I should think of it like this: Each time you move, the snake's body extends by one cell at the end. So after moving left once:

- Head: (6,8)
- Body: [7,7], now becomes [6,8] added to the list? No—wait no.

Wait maybe I'm getting confused with how the body is represented. Maybe it's better not to get bogged down in that and instead focus on ensuring each step doesn't collide with existing positions except for food eaten.

So moving from (7,8) left to (6,8):

- Now head at (6,8)
- The previous tail was at (7,7), but since we're moving left, the body is now [(7,7)] shifted by one?

Wait perhaps it's better not to think in terms of a list and just make sure that each new position doesn't collide with existing positions.

In this case:

Starting at (7,8) facing UP. Possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT because moving DOWN would reverse direction if allowed—but wait no: initial direction is UP; you can only move to LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE as per rule 3—so first step after being UP cannot be DOWN.

So for the first move:

Option 1: LEFT → (6,8)

Is this safe? Yes, because body was at (7,7), so no collision. So proceed.

Then next move from (6,8): can still move LEFT to (5,8). No problem as (5,8) is not occupied by the snake's body except for previous positions which are now behind.

Proceeding in this way:

Move 1: LEFT → (6,8)

Move 2: LEFT → (5,8)

Move 3: LEFT → (4,8)

Move 4: LEFT → (3,8)

Move 5: LEFT → (2,8) – which is the apple.

Wait! That's exactly what I want. So in five moves:

- Move 1: LEFT to (6,8)
- Move 2: LEFT to (5,8)
- Move 3: LEFT to (4,8)
- Move 4: LEFT to (3,8)
- Move 5: LEFT to (2,8)

So each move is LEFT, and after moving five times left from the initial position, we reach (2,8), which is where the apple is.

But what about collision? Each time we're moving to a new x-coordinate. Let's check if any of these positions interfere with the body:

- After first move: body includes (7,7) and (6,8)
Wait no—the initial body was only at (7,7). Moving LEFT once: head is now at (6,8), so tail moves from (7,7) to ... Actually, wait—if we're moving left five times without eating any apple, will the snake collide with itself?

Yes, because after each move, the entire body shifts behind.

So let me simulate each step:

Step 0:
- Head: (7,8)
- Body: [ (7,7) ]

Step 1:
Move LEFT to (6,8):
- New head is at (6,8)
- The tail was at (7,7), which will be removed unless food is eaten.
Wait no—if you're moving left once, the new body would have:

Previous positions: [ (7,8) ] → after moving LEFT:
New positions are [(6,8)] + previous body except for the first. Wait perhaps it's that when moving without eating, each segment moves forward by one, and the tail is removed.

So initial steps:

Step 0:
- Body segments: [(7,8)]

Step 1:
- Move LEFT → (6,8)
- New body becomes [ (7,8), ... ]? No—wait perhaps it's better to think of each move as adding a new segment and removing the last.

No. Wait maybe in this case:

Each time you move, regardless of direction, unless food is eaten, the tail segment is removed.

So initial step 0: body has only (7,8). Then moving LEFT:

Step 1:
- New head at (6,8)
- Previous tail was at (7,8), which becomes a new segment
Wait perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think differently: when you move left once without eating, the snake's body would have two segments.

But since in our case, moving multiple times to reach apple, we need to make sure that after each step, none of the previous positions are occupied by the new head except for food eaten.

So initial position:

Step 0:
- Head: (7,8)
- Body: [(7,8)]

After first move LEFT:

- Head at (6,8)
- New body is [ (7,8), ... ]? Or perhaps I should think of it as the snake's body adding a new segment each time.

Wait maybe for this purpose, we can model the snake's body as always having one more segment than before when moving without food. So:

Step 0:
- Body: [(7,8)]

After move LEFT (step1):
- Head at (6,8)
- New body is [ (7,8), ...? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to model each step as the snake's head moves and adds a new segment in front. So:

Start:
- Body: [A] = [(7,8)]

After moving LEFT once:
- New head at (6,8)
- New body is [B], which includes previous segments except tail.

Wait no—this isn't clear.

Perhaps the key point here is that we're starting with one segment (the head) and when moving without eating food, each move adds a new segment in front of the current head. Therefore:

Move 1: LEFT → body becomes [ (6,8), previous head ]

So perhaps more accurately, each move adds a new cell as the first element of the body list.

But this seems getting too detailed for my consideration; maybe it's better to proceed with simulation.

Each time moving left without food eaten, the snake's position is such that:

Step 1: (6,8)

Check if any previous positions are occupied by current head. Since initial was at (7,8), which is now behind, so no collision.

Move 2: LEFT → (5,8). Check if (5,8) is not in the body segments except food position. So far, body has:

After step1:
- Head: (6,8)
- Body includes previous head at (7,8)

So after moving to (5,8):

Check if any of these positions are already occupied by other parts.

But since each time you move left without eating, the tail is lost but another segment is added in front. Wait no—if it's just the head that moves and the body follows, then each step adds a new cell at the position one to the left, effectively creating an extended chain behind.

So after five such moves:

Each move will extend the snake further without any collision because all positions are moving uniformly towards the apple.

But wait: starting from (7,8), moving LEFT once gets us to 6,8. Then again to 5,8; and so on until we reach 2,8 in five steps.

So perhaps this is safe as each step moves left without crossing any previous positions except for the tail which is lost unless food is eaten.

Therefore, with no obstacles or food along the way, moving LEFT multiple times should get us to apple safely.

But wait: do I need to make sure that when I move from (7,8) to (6,8), that cell isn't already part of the body except for where it will be?

Wait in step 0:

Body is [(7,8)]

After step1:
- Move LEFT → head at (6,8)
- The rest is previous positions. Wait but I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each time you move left without food eaten, your new position adds to the front of the body list and removes the last element—so it's a shifting process.

But in that case:

Step0:
Body: [ (7,8) ]

After moving LEFT once (step1):
- New head at (6,8)
- Body becomes [(7,7), ...? Or is it [ (6,8) ] and the tail was removed?

Wait no—if you're moving left without eating food, your body is extended by adding a new cell to the front.

So initial body after step0: [(7,8)]

After moving LEFT once:

- New head at (6,8)
- Body becomes [ (6,8), ... ]

But this doesn't make sense because you're only supposed to add one segment. Maybe each move adds one segment in front of the current body.

So initial steps:

Step0: [(7,8)]

After step1: [(6,8), 7,8]

Wait but that would mean two segments? So how does this work?

Perhaps it's better not to model the entire snake's body and just focus on the head movement. Because in reality, each time you move without eating, your head moves left by one cell, but since there's nothing blocking, you can go straight.

So if I'm moving LEFT multiple times from (7,8), will that cause any collision?

Let me imagine:

Start at position 7,8

Move LEFT to 6,8. Is this position unoccupied? Yes, because only the head was there before. The previous head is now behind as a tail.

Then move LEFT again: 5,8. Again, no issue since nothing is in that position yet.

Continue until we reach 2,8:

7 →6→5→4→3→2

Yes, all these positions are empty because the snake has only its own body moving along; thus each movement to a new left cell doesn't conflict with any other part of itself as it's just following in a straight line.

So this would work without any issues. Therefore, moving LEFT multiple times step by step from (7,8) should reach 2,8 safely without getting stuck or colliding with own body parts.

Hence, the minimal number of moves is 5 steps to the left.
</think>

To determine the minimum number of moves required for the snake to reach the apple at position (2,8), we analyze its current direction and plan an optimal path. The snake starts at position (7,8) facing a direction that allows it to move towards decreasing x-coordinates.

1. **Current Position**: (7,8)
2. **Direction Facing**: Left
3. **Target Position**: (2,8)

Each move to the left decreases the x-coordinate by 1 while keeping the y-coordinate constant at 8. The snake can safely move in this direction without encountering any obstacles since there are no other segments blocking its path.

Calculating the number of moves needed:
- From 7 to 6: 1 move
- From 6 to 5: 2nd move
- From 5 to 4: 3rd move
- From 4 to 3: 4th move
- From 3 to 2: 5th move

Thus, the snake requires exactly five moves to the left to reach its destination.

$\boxed{5}$
