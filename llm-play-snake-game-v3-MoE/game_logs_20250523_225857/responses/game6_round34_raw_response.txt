========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without getting trapped or colliding. The snake is currently at (3,7), facing right, and the apple is at (7,6). 

First, I need to consider the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction on the first move if it's moving in a specific direction. Since the current direction is "RIGHT," the next move can't be "DOWN" because that would be reversing.

The goal is to get from (3,7) to (7,6). So, the head needs to move right 4 times and down once. Each move should be planned carefully to avoid collisions with the body segments or walls.

Looking at the current state, the snake's body cells are [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]. The snake is hugging the left side of the grid, which might make it difficult to move right without getting blocked. However, since the head is at (3,7), moving right first is possible.

I should calculate the Manhattan distance, which is |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5 moves. But I need to ensure that each step doesn't cause a collision and that the body segments move appropriately.

Since the apple is at (7,6), moving right from (3,7) will lead towards it. After moving right twice, the head would be at (5,7). Then, moving down once brings it to (5,6). From there, moving right again would take it closer to the apple.

I also need to check if the snake can grow by eating the apple. If the head moves to (7,6), that's the apple, so the body will grow, adding one more segment without removing the tail. This ensures the snake doesn't get stuck immediately after eating.

Now, considering the path:

1. Move right from (3,7) to (4,7). This is safe as there's no collision.
2. Move right again to (5,7).
3. Then move down to (5,6), avoiding any body segments.
4. Continue moving right towards (6,6) and then to (7,6).

Each step should be checked for collisions with the current body and future positions. The body will shift each time, so I need to make sure that after each move, the new head isn't colliding with any of the body segments except when growing.

Also, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move left. So, after reaching (7,6), the next move should be possible without getting trapped.

Finally, I'll outline the moves step-by-step to ensure each direction is valid and leads safely towards the apple.

{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake will move right twice, then down once, and then right two more times to reach the apple while avoiding collisions with its own body. This path ensures the head moves towards the target while maintaining a clear path."
