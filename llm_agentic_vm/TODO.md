In the JSON file, for write a Python program of 100 lines of code,
- instead of `{"command": "echo <100 lines of code>"}`
- we will do `{"command": "echo < ONE line of code>"}` 100 times.

In this way, we will have much less JSON extraction issues. For this moment, for multiple lines of code, JSON extraction is a big issue (fails almost 100% of the time).
