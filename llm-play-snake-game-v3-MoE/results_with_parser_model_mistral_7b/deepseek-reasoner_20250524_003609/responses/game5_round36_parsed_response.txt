{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "UP", "UP"], "reasoning": "The apple is located four spaces right and one space down from the snake's current position. To reach it, the snake must first move three times to the right to position itself directly above the apple (x = 9, y - 1). Since the snake cannot go through its own body segments, it needs to move down first before moving up to the apple. After eating the apple, it can then move up twice."}
