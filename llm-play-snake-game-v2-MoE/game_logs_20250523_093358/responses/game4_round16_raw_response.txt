========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

To plan a safe path for the snake's head from (1, 4) to eat the apple at (6, 5), we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Direction Constraint**: The current direction is DOWN. We cannot move UP on the first step.
2. **Collision Avoidance**: The snake must avoid colliding with its body and the walls of the grid.
3. **Path Planning**: We need a sequence of moves that will take us from (1, 4) to (6, 5).

Let's break down the path planning:

- Start at (1, 4).
- Current direction is DOWN, so we can move: RIGHT or DOWN initially.
- From (1, 4), moving UP is not possible due to direction constraints.

We need to reach (6, 5):
- We must move RIGHT multiple times and UP once.

To move from (1, 4) to (6, 5), we should:
- Move RIGHT until x = 6
- Then adjust y by moving UP

Let's construct the path:

### Step-by-Step Path Construction:

1. Start at (1, 4)
2. Move RIGHT: (2, 4)
3. Move RIGHT: (3, 4)
4. Move RIGHT: (4, 4)
5. Move RIGHT: (5, 4)
6. Move RIGHT: (6, 4)
7. Move UP: (6, 5)

This path avoids all body cells and grid boundaries.

Here's the JSON output with the path:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move RIGHT five times to reach x=6, then UP once to reach y=5."
}
```

This plan ensures we move safely from (1, 4) to (6, 5).
