<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (3,6) to the apple at (5,0). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (3,6), and it's moving RIGHT. The body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So looking at these positions, the snake seems to be a bit spread out but there might be some overlap I need to avoid.

First, I should note that after moving, the head becomes part of the body, and the tail either shrinks or stays if it ate an apple. The apple is currently not eaten yet, so after the first move where it eats the apple, the snake will grow by one segment, meaning the tail won't shrink on the next move.

The direction can't be reversed unless it's NONE. Since the current direction is RIGHT, I can't go LEFT immediately. So from (3,6), the possible initial moves are UP or DOWN, but wait—no, because if current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. Wait no: rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. So since it's moving RIGHT now, next move can't be LEFT. But according to the problem statement, direction vectors are given, so from RIGHT, the possible moves would exclude LEFT?

Wait, no—the initial direction is RIGHT. The movement rules say that you can't reverse direction, meaning if you're going UP, you can't go DOWN next. So since the current direction is RIGHT, I think the first move can be any direction except LEFT because that's reversing. Wait no—rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. If the current direction is RIGHT, then the next direction can't be LEFT (since that would be a 180-degree turn). But in this problem statement, when the snake is moving in a certain direction, the next move can't be the opposite. So from RIGHT, next moves can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again, but not LEFT.

Wait, no—rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT, and vice versa. So initial direction is RIGHT, so first move can't be LEFT. So the possible moves from (3,6) are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But looking at the body cells, I need to make sure that moving in a certain direction doesn't cause collision with any part of the body. Let's list all possible next positions:

If I go UP from (3,6), new head is (3,7). Now, checking if (3,7) is in the body: yes, because (3,7) is one of the body cells. So moving UP would cause collision—so that's not allowed.

If I go DOWN from (3,6), new head is (3,5). Is (3,5) part of the body? The body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So no, it's not in the body. But wait—since the snake moves, when the head moves down to (3,5), the body will shift. Wait, but for collision detection, do I check if the new head position is already occupied by any part of the body? Because if so, then moving DOWN would be safe because (3,5) isn't in the current body.

Alternatively, perhaps when considering the next move, we need to ensure that after moving, the new head doesn't collide with any part of the updated body. But I'm not entirely sure how collision detection works here. Wait, rule 4 says the snake dies if it collides with its body—so the new head position must not be in the current body.

So for the first move:

- UP leads to (3,7), which is in body → invalid.
- DOWN leads to (3,5), which isn't in body → valid.
- RIGHT leads to (4,6). Is (4,6) in body? The body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), ...], so no. So moving right is also an option.

So initial possible moves: DOWN or RIGHT.

But according to rule 3, since current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT—so I can choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But from above analysis, UP is invalid because of collision, so first move options are DOWN and RIGHT.

Now, looking at the apple's position (5,0), which is quite far down and to the right. From (3,6) to (5,0), the x increases by 2, and y decreases by 6. So we need a net of two rights and six downs.

But I also have to consider that after each move, the snake's body changes. Let me think about possible paths.

Let me consider both options:

Option 1: Move DOWN first to (3,5).

Then, from there, what can I do? Next direction cannot be opposite of current. Since we moved DOWN, next moves can't be UP unless the direction is NONE—wait no, each move's direction is determined based on the previous move.

Wait, movement rules say that you can only change direction if it doesn't reverse. So after moving DOWN from (3,6) to (3,5), the current direction becomes DOWN. Then next moves cannot be UP unless direction is NONE—but since we've changed direction, next move can be any except UP? Or wait, no: rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. If current direction is DOWN, then next move can't be UP.

Wait, I think each move's direction must not be the opposite of the previous move's direction unless it's NONE. So after moving DOWN, next move can't be UP. So from (3,5), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

But let's see where we need to go: from (3,6) → (5,0). We need two rights and six downs. But since the snake is currently at (3,6), moving down would reduce y by 1 each time.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to move right first because the apple is further in x direction. Alternatively, maybe a combination of moves.

Alternatively, another approach: let's see what the Manhattan distance says. The current head is at (3,6), and the apple is at (5,0). So the distance is |5-3| + |0-6|= 2+6=8 steps. But that doesn't account for obstacles.

Looking back, I need to plan a path that avoids collision with body parts as the snake moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the current body and see where the snake is. The body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So the snake is a bit spread out but seems to have a tail that's moving towards lower x and higher y.

Wait, perhaps drawing the grid would help.

Let me sketch the grid:

- The head is at (3,6). Moving right leads to (4,6), which is not in body.
- If I go right first: new head is (4,6). Body becomes [(4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] plus the old head at (3,6) but wait no—the snake's body includes all cells except the head. So when moving right, the new head is (4,6), and the previous head (3,6) becomes part of the body.

Wait, after each move:

- The new head = head + direction.
- The old head becomes part of the body segments (except for when an apple is eaten).
- If an apple is eaten, the tail doesn't shrink, so the snake grows by one segment.

So in this case, since we haven't eaten the apple yet, after each move, the tail will shrink unless we eat the apple. So moving right would make the body include (3,6) as a new segment, and the tail (2,6) is removed.

Wait no: when you move, the head becomes the new position, and all body segments shift forward. The tail is removed except if an apple was eaten in that step. So after moving right from (3,6), the body would be [(4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7), (3,6)], but wait no—that's not correct.

Wait, let me think again: each move, the head moves, and all body segments follow. So when moving from (x,y) to (x', y'), the previous head becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed if no apple was eaten.

So initial state:

Head: (3,6)

Body: [(4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]

If we move right to (4,6):

New head: (4,6)

The body becomes [head_old] + all previous body except the last element. So new body is [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7)].

Wait no—because when you move, each segment follows the next one. So the head moves to (4,6). Then, the first body cell (4,7) moves to where the head was (3,6)—no, wait: no, the movement is that each part of the body follows the previous one.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model how the body updates after a move. Each time the snake moves:

1. New head = current head + direction vector.
2. The new body consists of all segments except the last one (tail), but if an apple was eaten in this move, the tail remains.

So for example, initial body: [B0, B1, B2, B3, B4] where each Bi is a coordinate.

After moving right:

- New head = H + RIGHT vector.
- The new body is [H] + B0, B1, B2, B3], but only if the apple was not eaten. If it was eaten, then the body becomes [H] + B0, B1, B2, B3, B4].

So in our case, since we haven't eaten the apple yet, after moving right, the body will include the old head (3,6) and the first four body cells except the last one.

Wait no—no: the initial body is given as [(4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]. So when we move right to (4,6), the new body becomes:

- The old head (3,6) added to the beginning of the body.
- Then all previous body cells except the last one.

So new body is [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7)].

Wait no—actually, each segment moves into the position of the next. So when you move right, the head goes to (4,6). The first body cell (4,7) moves to where the head was: (3,6). Then the next cells follow accordingly. Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a queue.

The snake is a list of segments in order from head to tail. When moving, each segment follows the previous one. So for example:

Original snake: H (3,6), B0 (4,7), B1 (3,7), B2 (2,8), B3 (2,7), B4 (2,6).

Wait no—the body cells are given as a list—probably in order from head to tail. So the head is followed by body segments.

So when moving right:

- New head: (4,6).
- The new snake becomes [new_head] + original_body[:-1], if not eating apple. So the new body would be [(4,7), (3,7), (2,8), (2,7)] plus the old head at (3,6)? Wait no—that can't be right.

Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me think of it as each segment follows the one in front. So when the head moves to a new position, each body part moves into the position where the previous part was.

So for example:

Original positions: H (3,6), B0 (4,7), B1 (3,7), B2 (2,8), B3 (2,7), B4 (2,6).

If head moves right to (4,6):

- New head is at (4,6).
- B0 was at (4,7) moves to where H was: (3,6). So new position of B0 is (3,6).
- Then B1 (3,7) moves to where B0 was: (4,7).
- B2 (2,8) moves to where B1 was: (3,7).
- B3 (2,7) moves to where B2 was: (2,8).
- B4 (2,6) is the tail and, since no apple was eaten, it's removed.

So after moving right, the snake would be:

H: (4,6)

B0: (3,6)

B1: (4,7)

B2: (3,7)

B3: (2,8)

And the tail is gone. So the body cells are [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8)].

Wait that makes sense because each segment follows the one in front. So now, after moving right, the snake's body includes all previous segments except the last one.

So when considering collision, I have to make sure that the new head position is not occupied by any of these new body cells.

In this case, moving right from (3,6) would take the head to (4,6). The body after move would be [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8)].

So checking if (4,6) is in body: no. So moving right is safe.

Similarly, moving down from (3,6) to (3,5):

After the move:

- H becomes (3,5).
- B0 (4,7) moves to (3,6).
- B1 (3,7) moves to (4,7).
- B2 (2,8) moves to (3,7).
- B3 (2,7) moves to (2,8).
- Tail (2,6) is removed.

So body becomes [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8)].

Again, the new head is at (3,5), which is not in the body.

So both moving right and down are safe first moves.

But wait, we need to choose a path that leads us towards (5,0) while avoiding collision with the body as it evolves.

Let me consider moving right first.

After move 1: H=(4,6); body=[(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8)].

Now, next moves cannot be to the opposite direction. Since we moved right last, next can't be left unless it's NONE, but since each direction change is only allowed as long as it's not reversing.

Wait no—the rule is that you can't reverse direction in a single move. So if your previous direction was RIGHT, you can't go LEFT next; if it was DOWN, you can't go UP, etc.

But wait the problem statement says: "You are not allowed to reverse directions (e.g., from right to left or down to up)."

Wait no—the original problem says:

"You are not allowed to reverse direction. For example, you cannot move right and then immediately move left."

So that means after moving in a certain direction, you can't move in the exact opposite direction in the next step.

But you can change direction to any other non-opposite direction.

For instance, if you moved RIGHT, next you can move UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT, but not LEFT.

Similarly, if you moved DOWN, next you can move LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN, but not UP.

So this constraint applies only to immediate reversals. So in our case, after moving right, the next moves can be right, up, down, but not left.

But wait—what is considered an allowed direction change? It's any change except for the exact opposite.

So moving from RIGHT to LEFT is disallowed; moving from RIGHT to DOWN or UP is allowed.

Similarly, moving from DOWN to UP is disallowed; moving from DOWN to LEFT or RIGHT is allowed.

Okay, so considering that:

After move 1: H=(4,6); last direction=RIGHT.

Possible next directions: RIGHT, UP, DOWN.

But we need to get towards (5,0), which requires moving right and down.

So let's consider possible paths.

Option 1: Move right again from (4,6) → (5,6). Then check if this is safe.

After move 2:

- H=(5,6)
- Body becomes [ (4,6), (3,6), (4,7), (3,7) ] plus any new segments? Wait no: when moving right again from (4,6), the body will shift as follows:

Body before move 2 is [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8)].

Wait no, after first move, body is [ (3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8) ].

So when moving right again:

- New head: (5,6)
- Previous head (4,6) becomes part of the body.
- The rest of the body shifts accordingly.

Wait no—I think I need to model this more carefully.

After move 1:

H=(4,6), last direction=RIGHT, body=[(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8)].

When moving right again in move 2:

- New head: (5,6)
- The previous head (4,6) becomes the first body cell.
- Then each subsequent body cell moves to where the previous one was.

So after move 2:

Body cells are [(4,6), (3,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

Because:

- New head is (5,6)
- Previous head (4,6) becomes first body
- Then the next cell was (3,6)—moves to where previous head was?
Wait no—wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to think that each segment follows the one in front of it.

So after move 1:

H=(4,6), B0=(3,6), B1=(4,7), B2=(3,7).

When moving right again:

- H becomes (5,6)
- B0 moves to where H was: (4,6)
- B1 moves to where B0 was: (3,6)
- B2 moves to where B1 was: (4,7)

So body after move 2 is [(4,6), (3,6), (4,7)].

Wait that doesn't make sense because the tail should be removed unless apple eaten. But since we didn't eat an apple in move 2, the tail is removed.

But wait, when moving from (4,6) to (5,6):

- H becomes (5,6)
- B0 was at (3,6)—moves to (4,6)
- B1 was at (4,7)—moves to (3,6)
- B2 was at (3,7)—moves to (4,7)

But wait that can't be because each segment moves into the position of the previous one.

Wait, I think a better way is:

Each body cell follows the cell in front. So when you move right, all body cells shift right as well.

So for example, after first move: H=(4,6), B0=(3,6), B1=(4,7), B2=(3,7).

Then moving right again:

- H becomes (5,6)
- B0 was at (3,6)—moves to where H was: (4,6)
- B1 was at (4,7)—moves to where B0 was: (3,6)
- B2 was at (3,7)—moves to where B1 was: (4,7)

So after move 2:

H=(5,6), body=[(4,6), (3,6), (4,7)].

Wait that seems inconsistent because (3,6) would be next after (4,6). So the positions are H=(5,6), B0=(4,6), B1=(3,6), B2=(4,7).

But this creates a loop perhaps? Because now (3,6) is followed by (4,7), which may cause collision.

Wait no—collision occurs if the new head's position is in the body after the move. So let's check:

After move 2, H=(5,6). The body cells are [(4,6), (3,6), (4,7)].

Is (5,6) in the body? No. So it's safe.

But then we can continue moving right again to (6,6):

Move 3: direction=RIGHT again.

H becomes (6,6)

Body cells become [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6)] because each segment moves into the position of the previous one.

Now, H=(6,6) is safe as it's not in the body.

But we need to get to (5,0). So moving right further won't help. Perhaps a better approach is to start moving down after some rights.

Let me think:

After move 1: H=(4,6), body=[(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8)].

Move 2: direction=DOWN from (4,6) → (4,5).

Check if this is allowed. Since last direction was RIGHT, next direction can't be LEFT, but DOWN is allowed.

So new H=(4,5). Now, what's the body?

After move 2:

H=(4,5)

Body becomes [(4,6), (3,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

Wait no—no: when moving down from (4,6) to (4,5):

- H moves to (4,5)
- B0 was at (3,6)—moves to where H was: (4,6)
- B1 was at (4,7)—moves to where B0 was: (3,6)
- B2 was at (3,7)—moves to where B1 was: (4,7)

But wait no—this might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the body shifts such that each segment follows. So:

Original after move 1: H=(4,6), body=[(3,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,8)].

Moving down from (4,6) to (4,5):

- New H=(4,5)
- B0 was at (3,6)—moves to where H was: (4,6)
- B1 was at (4,7)—moves to where B0 was: (3,6)
- B2 was at (3,7)—moves to where B1 was: (4,7)

But this seems conflicting because now some cells are overlapping.

Wait no—each body cell moves into the position of the previous one. So:

After moving down from (4,6):

H=(4,5)

B0 follows H, so it's at (3,6) → where? No—I think I'm getting confused.

Perhaps a better approach is to realize that each move affects the body as follows: when you move in direction D, all body cells shift towards your previous position.

Wait no—that might not be correct. Maybe each cell moves to the next cell's position from the front.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the snake's movement step by step, keeping track of the head and body positions after each move.

But given that this is time-consuming, maybe I should outline a possible path:

Option 1:

Move right, then down multiple times.

Let me see:

Start: H=(4,6), last direction=RIGHT

Move down to (4,5). Check if safe. Body after move 2 is [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)] → no collision with H=(4,5).

Then continue moving down to (4,4). Is this allowed? Last direction was DOWN.

Wait—no: last direction was RIGHT in move 1, then we moved DOWN in move 2. So next moves can be any except UP or the opposite of current direction.

But if we're at move 2 and moved DOWN, our previous direction is DOWN, so next can't be UP.

So for move 3, directions allowed are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

But moving further down would take us towards (4,5)→(4,4), etc., which is in the desired path to (5,0).

Wait no—wait, our target is (5,0). So perhaps after getting into position (5,6), we need to move down multiple times.

Alternatively, maybe a better path is:

Move right once, then move down until reaching row 0, then move right again if needed. But that seems inefficient.

Wait no—target is (5,0), so from start at (4,6), moving right to (5,6) and then moving down six times would reach (5,0). That's a total of seven moves: right once, then down six times.

But each move must not reverse direction. Since after the first move right, we can't go left again; but moving down is allowed as it's not reversing.

So possible path:

Move 1: RIGHT → H=(5,6), body=[(4,6)]

Wait no—wait, initial position was (4,6). After moving right once, body includes the previous positions.

Wait let me model this step by step:

Initial state:
H=(4,6)
Body segments: none? Or is there a tail?

Wait wait, in snake-like movements, when you move, your body follows. So after first move, the head moves, and the tail either grows or shortens depending on whether food is eaten.

But in this problem, I don't think we're considering growth; perhaps it's just moving without growing, which would mean that the body follows as a queue.

Wait no—the original problem doesn't specify whether the snake is growing or not. It might be a standard snake movement where each move shifts all segments forward, with the head moving and the tail either staying the same length (if no food) or growing (if food is eaten). But since there's no mention of eating, perhaps we can assume that the snake's length remains constant.

Wait wait, in the problem statement for the other example, when the snake moves from (4,6) to (5,6), the body positions are given as [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)], which suggests that the body is moving and not growing—meaning the snake's length remains the same.

So in our case, perhaps the initial position has a certain number of body segments, but for simplicity, maybe we can assume that the snake starts with just the head at (4,6) and no body. But that might not be accurate because when it moves right, the previous positions are part of the body.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify:

When a snake moves forward, each segment follows the one in front. So if the snake is at H=(4,6), B0=(3,6), etc., moving right would cause all segments to shift right by one, with the head moving to (5,6) and the tail dropping off.

But perhaps for our problem, we can model it as the body following the head without changing length. So each move appends a new head position and removes the last segment unless food is eaten, which isn't applicable here.

Wait no—the problem doesn't mention eating food, so I think the snake's length remains fixed, meaning that when you move, each segment moves forward, and the tail stays in place unless there's growth. But without food, perhaps the snake's length remains constant. Hmm.

I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Move right from (4,6) to (5,6). Now, body includes (4,6), which was previous head.
2. Then move down six times: each time moving the head down and shifting the body.

Each down move would take us closer to row 0.

So possible moves:

1. RIGHT → H=(5,6)
   Body segments after this move: [(4,6)]

But wait, initially, there were no body segments? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake starts with a certain length. In the example given in the problem statement (the other one), moving right from (4,6) results in body positions [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)], which suggests that the initial snake had three segments: H=(4,6), B0=(3,6), B1=(4,7), etc.

But without knowing the initial length, it's hard to model accurately. Maybe for our problem, we can assume that after each move, the body follows by shifting positions, and the tail is removed unless food is eaten (which isn't the case here).

So perhaps moving right once gets us to (5,6), with body at (4,6). Then moving down six times would take us to (5,0).

But let me check for each move if it's allowed and safe.

Move 1: RIGHT → H=(5,6). Body=[(4,6)].
- Allowed since we can change direction from initial (no prior direction) or assuming initial direction was something else; but in this case, the first move is right, so no issue.
- Safe because body is at (4,6), not interfering.

Move 2: DOWN → H=(5,5). Body shifts to [(5,6), (4,6)]? Wait that doesn't make sense. Maybe after moving down from (5,6) to (5,5), the previous head (5,6) becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed.

Wait no—if the snake's length remains fixed, say three segments, then after each move, all segments shift forward.

But without knowing the initial length, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the snake only has the head moving, and there are no body segments to worry about unless the snake is longer than one segment.

Wait in the problem statement example, when the snake moves right from (4,6) to (5,6), the body positions are given as [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)], which suggests that the initial length was three segments. So perhaps in this case, we can assume a similar starting point.

But I think I'm overcomplicating; maybe it's better to outline moves without worrying too much about body positions, focusing on direction changes and reaching the target.

Another approach is to realize that from (4,6), moving right twice gets us to (6,6), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, move right once to (5,6) then down six times to reach (5,0).

But let me check if this is allowed without reversing direction:

- Move 1: RIGHT → H=(5,6). Last direction=RIGHT.
- Move 2: DOWN → allowed since not opposite of previous. Now last direction=DOWN.
- Subsequent moves can continue DOWN as long as needed because we're not reversing.

So after six DOWN moves from (5,6), we reach (5,0).

But wait, moving down once takes us to row 5, then another down to 4, and so on until row 0. So that's six moves: from 6→5→4→3→2→1→0.

Yes, that would take six DOWN moves after the initial RIGHT move.

So total moves:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN
7. DOWN

But wait, seven moves: one right and six downs.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient path exists by moving down first then right.

But from (4,6), moving down to (4,5) is possible, but then moving right would require not reversing direction. Let's see:

Move 1: DOWN → H=(4,5). Last direction=DOWN.
- Body shifts accordingly.
Move 2: RIGHT → allowed since previous was DOWN, and RIGHT isn't opposite. Now at (5,5).
Then continue moving down to reach row 0.

But that would require more moves than necessary.

Wait no—starting from (4,6), moving right once takes us to (5,6) in one move, then six downs to reach (5,0). Total of seven moves.

Alternatively, moving down first to (4,5), then right to (5,5), and then five more downs: total of 1+1+5=7 moves as well. So same number of moves either way.

But direction changes are important—can we make fewer moves?

Wait no, because from row 6 to row 0 is six steps down. Plus one right step: seven total.

So the minimal number of moves would be seven.

Thus, a possible sequence is:

1. RIGHT → (5,6)
2. DOWN → (5,5)
3. DOWN → (5,4)
4. DOWN → (5,3)
5. DOWN → (5,2)
6. DOWN → (5,1)
7. DOWN → (5,0)

Now, checking for direction reversals:

- After move 1: direction=RIGHT.
- Move 2: direction changes to DOWN—not a reversal since previous was RIGHT, opposite is LEFT.
- From then on, all moves are DOWN; no reversals.

So this sequence is valid.

Alternatively, another possible path could be moving right twice and then down five times:

Move 1: RIGHT → (5,6)
Move 2: RIGHT → (6,6) [but target is (5,0), so not efficient]
Wait no—this would take us away from the target. So better to move right once, then down.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves is seven.

The snake starts at position (4, 6). To reach (5, 0) without reversing direction and ensuring each move is valid, the optimal path involves moving right once followed by six consecutive downward moves. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Move Right**: The head moves from (4, 6) to (5, 6).
2. **Move Down Six Times**: Each down move decreases the y-coordinate by 1 until reaching y=0.

This results in a total of seven moves: one right and six downs.

**Answer**: \boxed{7}

## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6)], to eat the apple at (5, 0).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
