Extension-specific concepts, in each folder "extensions/blablabla_v0.0N", should remain visible (# TODO:very very important, very very much visible because we want to learn things just by looking at the code of each extension and each of its version, without even going to the common folder, because common stuffs are just too common, that's why it's named "common")










Shared Utilities: Common code should be properly placed in extensions/common/
No Cross-Extension Sharing: Extensions should share via common only
Standalone Principle: Extension + common = standalone
