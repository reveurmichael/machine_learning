========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to get the snake from (0,4) to eat the apple at (1,3). Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the current state. The head is at (0,4), and it's moving LEFT. The body cell is [(1,4)]. So, the snake's body goes from (0,4) to (1,4). That means the tail is at (1,4).

The apple is at (1,3), which is directly below the head if we consider the grid as bottom-left being (0,0) and top-right (9,9). Wait, no, actually, in this coordinate system, y increases upwards. So, (0,4) is higher up than (0,3). The apple is at (1,3), which is one unit to the right and one unit down from the head.

But wait, the current direction is LEFT, so if I choose a different direction now, I have to make sure it's not the reverse. Since the current direction is LEFT, I can't go RIGHT next. Wait, no—the rule says you can't reverse. So, LEFT and RIGHT are reverses, meaning after moving LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, no: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So, if current direction is LEFT, I cannot choose RIGHT. But in this case, the current direction is LEFT, and the head is moving left, but let's see.

Wait, no—the current direction is given as "LEFT", which means the snake was previously moving LEFT. But when planning the next move, the first move can't be the reverse of the current direction. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

So, from (0,4), currently moving LEFT, what are my possible directions? The possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again. Wait no—the movement rules say that you cannot choose the opposite direction. So current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, let's clarify: if current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is NONE, any first move is allowed. In this case, the current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT.

So, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

Wait, no—the movement rules say that you can't reverse, but you can continue moving in the same direction if it's safe. So from LEFT, you can choose any direction except RIGHT.

But wait, the head is at (0,4). If I go LEFT again, the new head would be (-1,4), which is outside the grid. That's a collision and death. So going LEFT is not possible because it goes out of bounds.

So from (0,4) moving LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. The options are UP or DOWN, but let's check each.

Let me visualize the current state:

Head: (0,4)
Body: [(1,4)] → so the snake is [ (0,4), (1,4) ]

So, the tail is at (1,4).

Now, I need to reach (1,3). Let's think about the possible paths.

First, let me consider moving DOWN from (0,4). That would take the head to (0,3), which is directly below. But wait, looking at the body cells: after moving down, we have to check for collisions.

But before that, when moving, the new_head must not collide with any BODYi except possibly the tail when it's about to move. So in this case, if I move DOWN from (0,4) to (0,3), let's see:

BODY cells are [(1,4)]. The tail is at (1,4). After moving down, new_head is (0,3).

Now, check collision: new_head is not in the body except perhaps if it's the tail's next position. Wait, no—the body after movement would be updated as follows:

If I choose DOWN, new_head is (0,3).

The current body is [(1,4)], which is behind the head.

So, when moving to (0,3), does that collide with any of the body segments? The only body segment is (1,4). So no collision because (0,3) != (1,4).

Wait, but after moving down, the new_head is (0,3), which is not in the current body cells. So it's safe.

So, can I move DOWN?

Yes, because it doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail, but in this case, the tail is at (1,4), so no collision.

Wait, no—the tail will stay if we eat an apple, but in this first move, we're not eating the apple. So after moving down to (0,3), the body would update as follows:

Insert old head (0,4) into BODY → new body is [(0,4)] + current body [(1,4)], so [(0,4), (1,4)]. Then remove tail because we're not eating apple.

Wait no: after moving down to (0,3), the new_head is (0,3). The body was [(1,4)]. So inserting old head (0,4) at front → [(0,4)] + current body → [(0,4), (1,4)]. Then remove tail because we didn't eat apple. Wait, no—the tail would be the last element of the body list after insertion.

Wait, let's clarify the update steps:

After moving to new_head, check collision.

Assuming safe, then:

a. Insert old head into front of BODY → new body starts with [old_head] + current_body.

b. If new_head == apple: grow (don't remove tail).

c. Else: remove last element (tail) from the updated body.

So in this case, moving down to (0,3), which is not eating apple:

a. Insert (0,4) at front → [(0,4)] + [(1,4)] = [(0,4), (1,4)]

b. Not eating apple, so remove last element → [(0,4)]. So new body is [(0,4)], and head is now (0,3).

So after moving down once:

Head: (0,3)
Body: [(0,4)] → because the tail was at (1,4) and we removed it.

Wait, no. The initial body is [(1,4)]. After inserting old head (0,4), the body becomes [(0,4), (1,4)], then since not eating apple, remove last element → [(0,4)].

So new state after moving down:

Head: (0,3)
Body: [(0,4)]
Tail: (0,4)

Wait, that's a problem because now the body is only one cell behind the head at (0,4). So the snake can't move into any of these positions except possibly the tail.

But let me think about the next steps. The apple is at (1,3), which is to the right and same y as current head after moving down once.

Wait, maybe I should try moving RIGHT instead, but I thought that was forbidden because current direction is LEFT, so can't go RIGHT. Or wait—current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT?

No—the movement rules say you cannot reverse. So if current direction is LEFT, you cannot choose RIGHT as the next move.

Wait, no: the rule says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So after moving LEFT, you can't move RIGHT in the next step. But you can move UP or DOWN.

But wait, the current direction is given as LEFT, which was the previous direction. When planning the next move, I have to avoid choosing the reverse direction. So if I'm currently facing LEFT (from prior movement), I cannot choose RIGHT next. So from (0,4) with current direction LEFT, possible moves are UP or DOWN.

So moving DOWN is allowed and safe as per collision checks.

But let's see what happens after that move.

After moving down to (0,3), the body becomes [(0,4)]. Now, can I then move RIGHT?

Because now the current direction would be DOWN, so next move cannot be UP. But in this case, after moving DOWN, the new head is at (0,3). The apple is at (1,3), which is to the right.

So from (0,3), with body [(0,4)], I can choose RIGHT as the next direction because the previous direction was DOWN, and I'm not reversing. So yes.

But wait, after moving down, the current direction becomes DOWN, so the next move can't be UP. So possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT?

Wait no: the movement rule applies based on the new direction. Let me clarify:

Each time you choose a direction D for the next step. If the current direction is C, then if C and D are reverses, it's invalid.

So after choosing DOWN from the initial position (current direction was LEFT), the next move's direction can't be UP because that would reverse the previous direction of DOWN? Or does each new direction only restrict the next one?

Wait, no. The rule is per step: when you choose a direction D, it cannot be the reverse of the current direction C.

So after moving in D1, then choosing D2 which is not the reverse of D1.

In this case:

First move: from LEFT to DOWN → allowed because DOWN is not the reverse of LEFT (LEFT's reverse is RIGHT).

Second move: from DOWN, possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Because UP would be the reverse of DOWN. So from DOWN, can't choose UP next.

So after moving down once, I can choose RIGHT as next direction.

Let me check that:

After first move: head at (0,3), body [(0,4)], current direction is DOWN.

Next move: choose RIGHT → which is allowed because current direction is DOWN; its reverse is UP. So choosing RIGHT is fine.

Moving right from (0,3) to (1,3), which is the apple's position.

So in that case, moving down then right would reach the apple.

But let's check for collisions:

After first move: head at (0,3), body [(0,4)].

Second move: choose RIGHT → new_head = (1,3).

Check collision with current body: [(0,4)]. So new_head is (1,3) which is not in the body except if it's the tail's next position. Wait, no—the tail after first move is at (0,4), so (1,3) is not part of the body.

Thus, moving right is safe.

After that, since we're eating the apple, the body will grow:

Insert old head (0,3) into body → [(0,3)] + current_body [(0,4)] = [(0,3), (0,4)]

Since we ate the apple, don't remove tail. So new body is [(0,3), (0,4)], and head is at (1,3).

But wait, no—the apple is eaten when moving to that position, so the body after inserting old head would be:

After moving right from (0,3) to (1,3):

a. Insert old_head (0,3) → new body starts with [ (0,3), (0,4) ]

b. Since we ate apple, don't remove tail.

So the body becomes [(0,3), (0,4)].

Wait, but in this case, the head is now at (1,3), and the body follows as [ (0,3), (0,4) ].

But that leaves a gap between (1,3) and (0,3). Does that cause any issues? No, because each segment moves forward.

Wait no—actually, when moving from (0,3) to (1,3), the body segments follow:

The old head (0,3) becomes part of the body, and the tail remains unless we eat an apple. But in this case, since we ate the apple, the body grows by one.

So after two moves: down then right, we reach the apple.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's allowed because when moving from (0,4) to (0,3), the body is [(1,4)] → becomes [(0,4)] after moving down. Then moving right, the new head is (1,3), and since we ate the apple, the body becomes [ (0,3), (0,4) ].

Wait, but that's a bit confusing because the movement might not be straightforward. Let me try to outline each step:

Initial state:
- Head: (0,4)
- Body: [(1,4)]
- Direction: LEFT

Move 1: DOWN → new head (0,3)
- Check collision: body is [(1,4)] → no collision.
- Insert old head (0,4) into body → [ (0,4), (1,4) ]
- Not eating apple, so remove last element → body becomes [(0,4)]
- New state:
  - Head: (0,3)
  - Body: [(0,4)]
  - Direction: DOWN

Move 2: RIGHT → new head (1,3)
- Check collision: body is [(0,4)] → no collision.
- Insert old head (0,3) into body → [ (0,3), (0,4) ]
- Since we ate the apple, don't remove tail → body remains [ (0,3), (0,4) ]
- New state:
  - Head: (1,3)
  - Body: [ (0,3), (0,4) ]
  - Direction: RIGHT

Now, this seems correct. But wait, does the apple being at (1,3) mean that when we move there, we eat it and grow? Yes.

So after two moves: down then right, we reach the apple.

Alternatively, could I have moved differently?

Another approach is to move UP first from (0,4), but since y increases upwards, moving up would take us to (-1,4), which is out of bounds. So can't do that.

Thus, the only possible initial moves are DOWN or LEFT (but LEFT leads to out of bounds). So down seems necessary.

So the steps would be:

1. Move DOWN from (0,4) → (0,3)
2. Move RIGHT from (0,3) → (1,3), eating the apple.

Wait, but when moving right from (0,3), we have to ensure that after inserting old head and not removing tail, the body is correctly updated.

So in this case, after two moves, it's possible to reach the apple.

But wait, what if I choose a different path? Like move down, then down again?

Wait, let me think. After moving down once, we're at (0,3). Then moving down again would take us to (0,2), but that's further away from the apple.

Alternatively, after moving down and right, as above, it's more efficient.

So the minimal steps are two moves: DOWN then RIGHT.

But let me make sure about the direction changes.

First move: current direction is LEFT → choose DOWN, which is allowed (not reverse).

Second move: current direction is DOWN → choose RIGHT, which is allowed because right is not the reverse of down (which would be up). So that's okay.

So, the sequence of directions is LEFT → DOWN → RIGHT.

Wait no—the first move's direction was LEFT, but after moving DOWN, the new direction becomes DOWN. Then from DOWN, choosing RIGHT is allowed.

Yes, correct.

Alternatively, could I have moved down twice?

First move: DOWN → (0,3)
Second move: DOWN → (0,2)
But then the apple is at (1,3), so need to go right, but that's another step.

So three moves: down, down, right. That would take longer than necessary.

Thus, moving down then right in two steps seems optimal.

Wait, but can I move right first? No, because current direction is LEFT, and next move cannot be RIGHT as it's the reverse.

No—current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. So must choose UP or DOWN. But UP leads to out of bounds, so only DOWN is possible.

Thus, initial step must be down.

So the plan is:

1. Move DOWN from (0,4) → (0,3)
2. Move RIGHT from (0,3) → (1,3), eating apple.

But wait, when moving right to (1,3), which is the apple's position, does that cause any collision with body segments?

At move 2:

- Head is at (0,3), body is [(0,4)]
- Move RIGHT: new head (1,3)
- Check collision: body is [(0,4)] → no collision
- Insert old head (0,3) into body → [ (0,3), (0,4) ]
- Since we ate apple, don't remove tail.

So yes, it's safe.

Thus, the two moves are possible.

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The initial direction is LEFT, and after moving DOWN, the new direction becomes DOWN for the next move. So when choosing directions, each step depends on the previous one.

Yes.

Another thing to consider: after moving down and then right, does the body wrap around in a way that causes any issues? No, because after inserting old head and not removing tail, it's just adding another segment.

So, the two moves seem sufficient.

But wait, let me double-check:

First move:

- From (0,4) LEFT to ( -1,4 ) is invalid, so only possible moves are DOWN or UP. But UP from (0,4) would go to (-1,5), which is out of bounds. So only DOWN is valid.

Thus, first move must be DOWN → (0,3).

Second move: can choose RIGHT because current direction is DOWN, and its reverse is UP, so RIGHT is allowed.

Yes.

Therefore, the answer should be two moves: DOWN then RIGHT.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its initial position to eat an apple while adhering to movement constraints. The snake starts at (0,4) moving LEFT and must reach the apple at (1,3). 

### Approach
1. **Initial State**: The snake's head is at (0,4), and it has one body segment at (1,4). The current direction of movement is LEFT.
2. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot move in the reverse direction immediately after its current direction. For example, if it moves LEFT, it cannot move RIGHT next.
3. **Goal**: Reach the apple located at (1,3) by moving the head towards it without colliding with its own body.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial state
head = (0, 4)
body = [(1, 4)]
directions = ['LEFT', 'DOWN', 'RIGHT', 'UP']
current_dir = 'LEFT'

# Move DOWN first to avoid out of bounds and then RIGHT to reach the apple
moves = []
next_pos = head
valid_moves = []

# First move must be DOWN since LEFT would take it out of bounds
if current_dir == 'LEFT':
    valid_move = 'DOWN'
else:
    valid_move = next possible direction

But in code terms, we can represent this as:

# Calculate the next position after moving down
next_pos = (head[0], head[1] - 1)
moves.append('DOWN')
body = [next_pos] + body  # Update body, keeping previous segments

# Now move RIGHT to reach the apple
next_pos = (next_pos[0] + 1, next_pos[1])
moves.append('RIGHT')
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Move**: The snake starts moving DOWN from (0,4) to (0,3). This is necessary because moving LEFT would take it out of bounds.
2. **Second Move**: After moving DOWN to (0,3), the snake can now safely move RIGHT to (1,3) where the apple is located. This movement is allowed as the current direction is DOWN, and RIGHT is not its reverse.

This approach ensures the snake reaches the apple in two moves without colliding with its body, adhering to all given constraints.
