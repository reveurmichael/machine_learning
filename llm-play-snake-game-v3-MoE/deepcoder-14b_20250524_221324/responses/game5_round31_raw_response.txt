========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (8,5), and the apple is at (6,0). I need to find a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its body or going out of bounds.

First, I'll note the current state: the head is at (8,5), and the body cells are [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. The direction is "LEFT", so the snake was moving left before. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse direction.

The apple is at (6,0), which is two steps to the left and five steps down from the head's current position. So, I need a path that covers these movements without causing any collisions.

Looking at the grid, the snake's body extends downward and then rightward. The tail is at (8,7). Since the apple is below the snake, maybe moving DOWN first would help avoid colliding with the body.

Starting from (8,5), if I move DOWN to (8,4), that should be safe because it's not occupied by any body part except possibly the tail. Wait, the body cells are [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. So (8,7) is the tail, but when moving down from (8,5), (8,4) isn't in the body list, so that's safe.

Next move: From (8,4), I can't go LEFT because that would be (7,4). Wait, noâ€”current direction was LEFT, but after moving DOWN once, the new direction becomes DOWN. So from (8,4), directions allowed are not opposite to current. Current is now DOWN, so next move can't be UP.

Wait, no: the movement rules say that you can't reverse direction immediately. The initial direction is LEFT, so the first move cannot be RIGHT. After moving in a new direction, subsequent moves just need to follow the general rule of not reversing.

But let me think about the path:

1. Move DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4). Now head is at (8,4), body cells are updated with the old head (8,5) added, and if it's a normal move (not eating apple), the tail would be removed. Wait, but in this case, the apple isn't at (8,4), so no growth.

Wait, no: after moving down to (8,4), the body will shift. The old head (8,5) is added to the front of the body list, making it [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (8,7) is removed. So the new body cells are [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)].

Wait no: initial body cells after head are [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]. The tail is at (8,7). Wait, that can't be right because the body list provided in the input is [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)], so the snake's body goes from head (8,5) to (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), and tail at (8,7). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me visualize this.

The head is at (8,5). The next body part is (9,5), which is to the right of the head. Then from (9,5) to (9,6) is up, then (9,6) to (9,7) is further up, and finally (9,7) connects to (8,7), which would be left by one.

Wait, that can't form a continuous snake because the last segment (8,7) should be adjacent to (9,7). So the body list is [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)], meaning the tail is at (8,7). The head is at (8,5).

So if I move down from (8,5) to (8,4), that's possible. Then the new body would be:

- New head: (8,4)
- Insert old head (8,5) into the front of the body list: so the body becomes [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)].
Wait no: the initial body after the head is [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. So when we move down to (8,4), the new head is (8,4). Then step 3a says to insert the old head (which was at (8,5)) at the front of the body list. So the body becomes [(8,5)] + [the existing body parts], which are [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. But wait, that can't be right because each consecutive pair must be adjacent.

Wait no: when moving down from (8,5) to (8,4), the new head is (8,4). Then the body list is updated by inserting the old head (8,5) at the front. So the new body list becomes [ (8,5) ] + [ (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ].

Wait that would make the body as [(8,5), (9,5), ...], but (8,5) to (9,5) is a move to the right, which is adjacent. Then (9,5) to (9,6) is up, etc. So yes, that's valid.

But then, since we didn't eat an apple, step 3c says to remove the tail, which was at (8,7). Wait no: in step 3, if it's a normal move (no apple eaten), after inserting the old head, we remove the last element of the body list. The initial body after head is [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. After adding (8,5) at front, the body becomes [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)], and then we remove the last element (8,7). So the new body list is [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)].

Wait no: the initial body cells provided are [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. So after inserting (8,5) at front, it's [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]? No, wait: the body cells list is from behind the head to tail. The initial body is [BODY1, BODY2, ..., TAIL]. So when you insert the old head at front, it becomes new BODY1, and then the rest follows.

Wait no: step 3a says "Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1)." So if the initial body is [B1, B2, B3], after inserting H (old head), it's [H, B1, B2, B3]. Then, in a normal move, step 3c says to remove the last element. So the new body becomes [H, B1, B2].

Wait no: initial body is [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. After inserting old head (8,5) at front, it's [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then, since no apple is eaten, we remove the last element (8,7). So new body becomes [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)].

So after moving down, the head is at (8,4), and the body is now [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ].

Wait no: wait, when you move, the new head is (8,4). Then step 3a says insert old head (which was (8,5)) at front of the body list. The original body list after the head was [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. So inserting (8,5) makes it [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then step 3c says to remove the last element if not eating apple. So new body is [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ].

Wait but wait: the initial body list in the input is [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. That means that after the head at (8,5), the next body part is (9,5), then (9,6), etc., and the tail is (8,7). So when you move down to (8,4), the new head is (8,4). Then step 3a: insert old head (8,5) at front of the body list. So the new body becomes [ (8,5) ] + [ (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ], making it [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then step 3c: remove last element because no apple eaten. So new body list is [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ].

So after the first move down to (8,4), the body is now [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]. The head is at (8,4). Then, from here, can I continue moving down?

Wait no: because (8,4) to (8,3) would be another move down. Let's check if that's safe.

The new body after first move is [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]. So (8,5) is connected to (9,5). Then (9,5) to (9,6), etc. The head is at (8,4), so the new body after moving down again would be:

- New head: (8,3)
- Insert old head (8,4) into front of current body list: [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ].
Wait no: the current body after first move is [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]. So inserting (8,4) at front makes it [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ].

Then step 3c: remove last element (9,7). So new body is [(8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)].

Wait no: the initial body after first move was [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ]? Wait no, after inserting and removing:

After moving down to (8,4):

- New head: (8,4)
- Insert old head (8,5) at front of body list: new body is [ (8,5) ] + original body (which was [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]). Wait no: the initial body in input is after the head. So when you insert old head into the body list, it's added to the front of the current body list.

Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

Original state:

- Head: (8,5)
- Body cells: [B1=(9,5), B2=(9,6), B3=(9,7), T=(8,7)]

After moving down to (8,4):

- New head: H' = (8,4)
- Step 3a: insert old head (H=8,5) at front of body list. So the new body list becomes [H=8,5] followed by B1, B2, B3, T.

Wait no: step 3a says to insert the old head into the front of the body list, which was [B1, B2, B3, T]. So inserting H at front gives [H, B1, B2, B3, T], making the new body list [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ].

Then step 3c: if no apple eaten, remove last element (T=(8,7)), so the new body is [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ].

Wait but that's four elements now. So after moving down once, the body becomes:

- Head: (8,4)
- Body: [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ]

So the snake is now from (8,4) to (8,5) to (9,5) to (9,6) to (9,7).

Now, can I move down again? From (8,4) to (8,3). Let's see:

- New head: (8,3)
- Insert old head (8,4) at front of body list [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ], making it [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ].
- Remove last element (since no apple eaten): new body is [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6) ].

Wait but wait: the movement from (8,4) to (8,3) would make the new head at (8,3). Then inserting old head (8,4) into front of body list [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ] gives [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ]. Then remove last element: new body is [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6) ].

But wait, the snake's body must be connected. So from (8,3) to (8,4): yes, that's adjacent. Then (8,4) to (8,5): also adjacent. Then (8,5) to (9,5): right move, which is allowed because they're adjacent.

So far, no collisions with the body.

After two moves down, head at (8,3), body cells [(8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)].

I can continue moving down to (8,2):

- New head: (8,2)
- Insert old head (8,3) into front of body list [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6) ], making it [ (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6) ].
- Remove last element: new body is [ (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,5) ].

This seems safe as well.

But I need to reach (6,0). So perhaps after moving down a few times, I can start moving left.

Wait, but the apple is at (6,0), which is two columns to the left and five rows down. Wait no: from (8,5) to (6,0) is 2 steps left and 5 steps down? Or is it row or column?

Wait grid coordinates can be confusing. Let's assume that the first number is x (column) and second is y (row). So moving left decreases x by 1, right increases x by 1; up increases y, down decreases y.

Wait no: typically, in grids, (x,y) where x is column, y is row, with y increasing as you go up. So from (8,5), moving down would decrease y to 4, then 3, etc., and left would decrease x to 7, then 6.

So the apple at (6,0): that's x=6, y=0. Wait that can't be right because y=0 would be below (assuming y starts at top as higher numbers). Wait maybe it's better to think of y increasing downwards. So (8,5) is row 5, and moving down increases y? Or decreases?

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in the input, the body cells are [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. That suggests that from (8,5), moving right to (9,5) is BODY1, then up to (9,6), etc., because y=5 to 6 would be up if y increases upwards.

Wait no: typically, in grids, higher y values go upward. So (9,5) is below (9,6). Wait no: wait, usually, in computer graphics, y increases downward, but in mathematics, y increases upward. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume that moving up increases y and down decreases it.

So from (8,5), moving up would be to (8,6), and down to (8,4).

Given that, the apple is at (6,0). That would be far below the current head. So perhaps a better path is to move down several times first, then left.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left initially, but since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. Wait no: initial direction was LEFT, so the first move cannot be RIGHT (step 2 in movement rules). But after that, any subsequent moves just have to follow general movement rules, not necessarily tied to the previous direction except for the immediate reversal.

Wait, no: the movement restriction is only that you can't reverse direction immediately. So if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. After moving in a non-reverse direction (like DOWN), the next moves can be any except reversing again.

So from (8,5), initial direction is LEFT, so first move can't be RIGHT. Let's say I move DOWN first to (8,4). Now the new direction is DOWN. From there, I can't move UP immediately (since that would reverse the current direction of DOWN).

Wait no: the movement rules are that you can't move in the opposite direction of your previous move. So if you moved LEFT last time, you can't move RIGHT next. Similarly, if you moved DOWN, you can't move UP next.

Wait, let me check:

The problem says:

"You cannot move in the reverse direction of your previous move."

So each time you make a move, the next move can't be the exact opposite (e.g., after LEFT, can't go RIGHT; after DOWN, can't go UP).

So after moving DOWN from LEFT, the next move can't be UP.

Wait no: if I first moved LEFT, then DOWN, then what? The previous move was DOWN, so the next can't be UP. But after that, the new direction is whatever the last move was.

So to plan a path:

1. Start at (8,5), initial direction could be any, but since previous move wasn't specified, perhaps it's free. Wait no: in the first move, there's no previous direction, so you can choose any direction except maybe opposite? No, I think for the first move, all directions are allowed.

Wait the problem says:

"You cannot move in the reverse direction of your previous move."

So on the first turn, since there is no previous move, all directions are allowed.

So from (8,5), possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN.

But wait, when you start, can you choose any direction? I think so.

Wait no: in the context of a snake game, the initial direction might be set, but since this is an AI problem, perhaps it's assumed that the first move can be any direction.

So let me assume that for the first move, all directions are possible.

But to avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to plan a path:

From (8,5):

1. Move DOWN to (8,4)
2. Then DOWN again to (8,3)
3. Continue down until reaching y=0? Wait no: if y starts at 5 and moving down decreases y, then from 5 to 4, etc., but the apple is at (6,0), which would be far below.

Wait wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coordinates. Maybe the y-axis increases downward, so from (8,5) moving down increases y to 6,7,... and up decreases y to 4,3,...

But this can vary, but for consistency, let's assume that:

- Moving UP increases y by 1 (so (x,y+1))
- Moving DOWN decreases y by 1 (so (x,y-1))

So from (8,5), moving down would go to (8,4).

The apple is at (6,0): x=6, y=0.

So from (8,5) to (6,0), I need to move left twice and down five times: x decreases by 2 (from 8 to 6), y decreases by 5 (from 5 to 0).

But the snake can't pass through itself. So each time I move, I have to ensure that the new head position isn't occupied by any part of the body.

So let's plan step by step:

Initial position:

- Head: (8,5)
- Body: [B1=(9,5), B2=(9,6), B3=(9,7), T=(8,7)]

Wait no, wait. The body cells in the input are [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)]. So from head at (8,5), the next body part is (9,5) which is to the right and same y=5? Wait that can't be connected unless it's a different direction.

Wait this suggests that after the head, the snake turns right. From (8,5), moving right to (9,5), then up to (9,6), then up to (9,7), then left to (8,7). So the snake is in a sort of square shape: from (8,5) -> (9,5) -> (9,6) -> (9,7) -> (8,7).

Wait that makes sense. So the snake's body is:

- Head at (8,5)
- Then right to (9,5)
- Up to (9,6)
- Up to (9,7)
- Left to (8,7)

So it's a U-shape.

Now, if I want to move down from (8,5), that would take the head to (8,4). Is that safe? Let's check:

After moving down once:

- New head: (8,4)
- Insert old head (8,5) into body list: new body is [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]
Wait no: step 3a says to insert the old head at the front of the current body. The current body was [B1=(9,5), B2=(9,6), B3=(9,7), T=(8,7)].

So inserting (8,5) at front makes new body:

[ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]

But then step 3c: remove last element if no food eaten. So new body becomes [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ].

Wait but the head is now at (8,4). The body starts with (8,5), which is connected to (9,5). But (8,4) is not connected to (8,5); that would require a move from (8,5) to (8,4), which is down.

Wait no: the head is at (8,4), and the first body part is now (8,5). So that's correct; the snake has moved down, so the new head is at (8,4), and the previous head (now body part) is at (8,5).

But wait, in grid terms, from (8,5) moving down to (8,4): yes.

Now, can I move down again? From (8,4) to (8,3). Let's see:

- New head: (8,3)
- Insert old head (8,4) into front of current body [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ], making new body:

[ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ]

Then remove last element (since no food eaten): new body is [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6) ].

This seems okay; the snake is now:

(8,3) -> (8,4) -> (8,5) -> (9,5) -> (9,6).

No self-intersections yet.

Continuing down to (8,2):

- New head: (8,2)
- Insert old head (8,3) into front of body [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6) ], making:

[ (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6) ]

Remove last element: new body is [ (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,5) ].

Still no collision.

Now, I can continue moving down to (8,1):

- New head: (8,1)
- Insert old head (8,2) into front of current body:

[ (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (9,5) ]

Remove last element: new body is [ (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) ].

Now the snake is:

(8,1) -> (8,2) -> (8,3) -> (8,4) -> (8,5).

No issues yet.

Next move down to (8,0):

- New head: (8,0)
- Insert old head (8,1) into front of body [ (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) ], making:

[ (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) ]

Remove last element: new body is [ (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ].

Now, from (8,0), I need to move left towards (6,0). But wait, y=0 is the bottom row. Can I go further down? No, perhaps y can't be negative, so (8,0) is as far down as possible.

So now, at (8,0), I can start moving left:

1. Move LEFT to (7,0):

- New head: (7,0)
- Insert old head (8,0) into front of body [ (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ], making:

[ (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ]

Remove last element: new body is [ (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ].

Now, the snake is:

(7,0) -> (8,0) -> (8,1) -> (8,2) -> (8,3).

No collision yet.

Next move LEFT to (6,0):

- New head: (6,0)
- Insert old head (7,0) into front of body [ (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ], making:

[ (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]

Remove last element: new body is [ (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2) ].

Now the head is at (6,0), which is the food location. So the snake has successfully reached the food.

But wait, I need to make sure that after moving into (6,0), the body doesn't collide with itself. The new body parts are:

- Head: (6,0)
- Body: [ (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2) ]

So none of these positions overlap except for the head and the rest, which is fine.

But wait, in this step-by-step process, I'm assuming that each move only adds one new position to the front and removes one from the end if no food is eaten. But since we're reaching the food, we don't remove anything; instead, the body grows by one segment.

Wait no: when you reach the food, you don't remove the tail; you keep it, so the snake's length increases by one.

So in this case:

When moving into (6,0), which is the food location, the step would be:

- New head: (6,0)
- Insert old head (7,0) at front of body [ (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ].

But since we ate the food, we don't remove anything. So new body becomes:

[ (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]

Wait no: initial body before moving was [ (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ].

After moving head to (6,0), and since we ate the food, the new body is:

[ (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]

Wait no: step 3 says that when you move into a position with food, you don't remove the last element; you keep all segments.

So yes, the body grows by one segment. So from length 4 to 5.

But in our case, we started at (8,0), moved left twice to reach (6,0). Wait no: I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait let's recount:

After moving down five times, the head is at (8,0), and the body is [ (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ].

Then move left to (7,0): new head (7,0), body becomes [ (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ] since we didn't eat food yet.

Wait no: when you don't eat food, you remove the last element. So after moving to (7,0):

- New head: (7,0)
- Insert old head (8,0) into body [ (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ]? Wait no.

Wait initial body before moving left from (8,0) is:

After being at (8,0), the previous step was when head was at (8,0) with body [ (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ].

When you move to (7,0):

- Insert old head (8,0) into front of current body: new body is [ (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ]

But since no food was eaten, remove last element (8,4): new body is [ (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ].

So the snake now is:

(7,0) -> (8,0) -> (8,1) -> (8,2) -> (8,3).

Wait no: actually, when you move from (8,0) to (7,0):

- The new head is at (7,0)
- The old head (8,0) becomes the next body part
- Then the rest follow.

So the new body list after moving left would be:

[ (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]

Wait no: no. Let me clarify the process:

When you move the head to a new position (x,y):

- If (x,y) is food:
   - Add (x,y) to the front of the body list
   - Do not remove the last element (so body grows by one)
- Else:
   - Add (x,y) to the front of the body list
   - Remove the last element (so body stays same length)

So in this case, when moving from (8,0) to (7,0):

- Check if (7,0) has food. Let's assume it doesn't; we're saving the food at (6,0).

So:

- New head: (7,0)
- Add to front: [ (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]
- Remove last element (which was (8,4) previously, but wait no.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let's re-express:

Initial body before moving left from (8,0):

Body list: [ (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ]

Head is at (8,0).

After moving to (7,0):

- New head: (7,0)
- Insert into front of body: [ (7,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4) ]
- Since no food eaten, remove last element (8,4): new body is [ (7,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]

Wait that can't be right because the head was at (8,0), and after moving left, the body should include (8,0).

Wait no: perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body updates.

Each time you move, the head moves to a new position. The old head becomes the next body segment, and the rest follow.

So initial state:

Head: (8,5)

Body: [ (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]

When moving down to (8,4):

- New head: (8,4)
- Body becomes [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]
- Since no food eaten, remove last element (8,7): body is now [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ]

Wait that doesn't make sense because the snake's body should be connected.

Wait perhaps I'm misapplying the steps. Let me refer back to the problem statement:

When you move in a direction:

1. The head moves one segment in the chosen direction.
2. If the new head position is on food:
   a. Add this new head to the front of the body list.
   b. Do not remove the last element (the tail remains, so length increases by 1)
3. Else:
   a. Add this new head to the front of the body list.
   b. Remove the last element from the body list (tail moves forward, no growth)

So applying that:

Starting at:

Head: (8,5)

Body: [ (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]

Move DOWN to (8,4):

- New head: (8,4)
- Since it's not food, add to front: new body is [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]
- Then remove last element: new body becomes [ (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ]

Wait no: initial body is [B1, B2, B3, T], where B1=(9,5), B2=(9,6), B3=(9,7), T=(8,7).

When moving head to (8,4):

- New head added to front: [ (8,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]
- Then remove last element: new body is [ (8,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) ]

Wait that doesn't make sense because the head was at (8,5), moving down to (8,4). The old head should now be part of the body.

Wait perhaps I'm getting confused with how the body is represented. Maybe the body list represents all segments except the head? Or including the head?

I think it's better to model the snake as a list where the first element is the head, followed by the body segments in order.

So initial state:

Snake: [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) ]

Wait no, that can't be right because from the initial problem, the snake's starting position must have its head at (8,5), and body extending to (9,5), etc.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model each step:

1. Initial setup: The snake is at positions [(8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5)], with head at (9,5). Wait no, the initial problem says the snake's head is moving towards (10,5) and the food is at (6,0).

Wait I'm getting confused about the initial position. Maybe I should just focus on the movement from wherever to reach (6,0).

But perhaps it's easier to think of the snake as a list where each move adds a new head and removes the tail unless food is eaten.

So regardless of the initial setup, after moving down five times and then left twice, assuming no obstacles, the snake can reach the food at (6,0) without colliding with itself.

But in this case, when moving from (8,0) to (7,0), the new head is at (7,0). The old head was at (8,0), which becomes part of the body. Then the rest follow: (8,1), etc.

So after that move:

Snake body: [ (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]

Then next move left to (6,0):

- Check if (6,0) has food. Yes.
- Add new head to front: [ (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]
- Do not remove the last element because we ate food.

So now the snake's body is:

Head: (6,0)

Body: [ (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) ]

No overlaps except for the head and body parts, which is fine.

Therefore, yes, the snake can reach the food at (6,0) by moving down five times and then left twice, without colliding with itself.

But wait, in my earlier steps, I might have made a mistake in counting the number of moves. Let me recount:

Starting from head at (8,5):

1. Move DOWN to (8,4)
2. DOWN to (8,3)
3. DOWN to (8,2)
4. DOWN to (8,1)
5. DOWN to (8,0) â†’ five down moves.

Then move LEFT to (7,0)

LEFT again to (6,0).

So total of seven moves: five downs and two lefts.

But in each step, except the last one where food is eaten, the body shifts correctly without overlapping.

Therefore, the answer is yes, it's possible.
</think>

The snake can reach the food at position (6, 0) by moving down five times and then left twice without colliding with itself. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head starts at (8,5), with its body extending towards (9,5). The food is located at (6,0).

2. **Move Down Five Times**:
   - Move 1: Head moves to (8,4).
   - Move 2: Head moves to (8,3).
   - Move 3: Head moves to (8,2).
   - Move 4: Head moves to (8,1).
   - Move 5: Head moves to (8,0).

   After these five downward moves, the snake's head is at (8,0), and its body extends from (8,1) upwards.

3. **Move Left Twice**:
   - First Left Move: Head moves to (7,0). The snake's body adjusts, with no collision as it shifts left.
   - Second Left Move: Head moves to (6,0), where the food is located. Since this is the food location, the snake grows by one segment without losing its tail.

4. **Final Position**: The snake's head is at (6,0) with the food consumed, and its body follows without any self-collisions.

**Answer**: Yes, the snake can reach the food at (6, 0). 

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
