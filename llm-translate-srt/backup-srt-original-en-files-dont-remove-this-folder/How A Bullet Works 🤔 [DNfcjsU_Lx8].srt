when you pull the trigger of a gun it
 

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,110
when you pull the trigger of a gun it
releases a pin which strikes the primer

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
releases a pin which strikes the primer
 

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,869
releases a pin which strikes the primer
at the base of the cartridge inside this

6
00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:07,879
at the base of the cartridge inside this
 

7
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,070
at the base of the cartridge inside this
cartridge is a chemically explosive

8
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
cartridge is a chemically explosive
 

9
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,749
cartridge is a chemically explosive
substance known as smokeless powder the

10
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:12,759
substance known as smokeless powder the
 

11
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,509
substance known as smokeless powder the
impact from the firing pin ignites this

12
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
impact from the firing pin ignites this
 

13
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,310
impact from the firing pin ignites this
powder inside the cartridge creating a

14
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
powder inside the cartridge creating a
 

15
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,830
powder inside the cartridge creating a
high press gas that rapidly expands this

16
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
high press gas that rapidly expands this
 

17
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,509
high press gas that rapidly expands this
energy pushes forward and forces the

18
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:24,519
energy pushes forward and forces the
 

19
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,790
energy pushes forward and forces the
bullet out of the cartridge driving it

20
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
bullet out of the cartridge driving it
 

21
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,760
bullet out of the cartridge driving it
down the barrel of the gun
