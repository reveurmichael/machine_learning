{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 6 left (from x=8 to x=2) and 3 up (from y=6 to y=9). Starting with UP avoids reversing direction and moves toward the apple's y-coordinate. Subsequent UP moves continue vertical progress. Once at y=9, moving LEFT six times navigates horizontally to the apple. Each move checks for body collisions (none in this path) and ensures safe progression. After reaching the apple, the snake grows, leaving valid moves (e.g., DOWN or LEFT) to avoid trapping."
