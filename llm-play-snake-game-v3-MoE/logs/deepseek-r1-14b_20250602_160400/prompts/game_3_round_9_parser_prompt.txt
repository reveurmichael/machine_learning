========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to move the snake from (5,8) to eat the apple at (5,9). 

First, looking at the current state: the head is at (5,8), and it's moving right. The body cells are [(4,8), (3,8), ..., (1,4)], which means the snake is currently extending from the head all the way down to (1,4). The apple is just one cell above the head at (5,9).

Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT because that's the opposite direction. So my options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But wait, moving RIGHT from (5,8) would take me to (6,8). But I need to check if this new head position collides with any body cells except possibly the tail when it moves. The current body cells after the head are [(4,8), ...], so moving right to (6,8) doesn't collide because none of the body cells are at (6,8). Also, since I'm moving towards the apple which is directly above, maybe a better approach is to move UP.

So let's consider moving UP first. The new head would be (5,9), which is exactly where the apple is. That seems perfect because then I can eat the apple and grow the snake. But I need to make sure that this move doesn't cause any collisions.

Looking at the body cells: after inserting the old head into the body list, the body becomes [old_head (5,8), (4,8), ...]. The new head is (5,9). Now, I need to check if (5,9) is occupied by any body cell except possibly the tail. Since the body cells are all below and left of the head, none of them are at (5,9). So this move should be safe.

When moving UP, since new_head equals apple position, we grow the snake by not removing the tail. That means the body increases in length by one. After eating, the head is at (5,9), and the body includes all previous segments plus the old head.

I also need to ensure that after eating, there's at least one legal move next turn. Since the apple was just eaten, the snake grows, but as long as we're not blocking our own path, it should be fine. In this case, since the apple is directly above and we moved into it, the next moves can adjust accordingly.

So moving UP from (5,8) to (5,9) seems like a safe and efficient way to reach the apple.

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP"],
  "reasoning": "Moving UP from (5,8) directly reaches the apple at (5,9) without collision."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 8) and whose body cells are in list format [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 9). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
