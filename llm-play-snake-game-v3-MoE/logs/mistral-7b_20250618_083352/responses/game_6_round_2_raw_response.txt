     "moves": ["UP", "UP", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT"],
     "reasoning": "The snake starts at (6,9) and moves up twice to reach (8,9). Then it moves left to reach (7,9), which is not an apple position. After that, the snake moves down once to reach the next row (7,8) where the apple is located. Finally, it moves right to eat the apple."
