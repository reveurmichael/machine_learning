{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 6 times (from x=7 to x=1) and down 8 times (from y=9 to y=1). Moving left first avoids immediate collisions and aligns with the grid boundaries. Each left move shifts the body safely, and subsequent down moves follow the same logic, ensuring no self-collisions. After reaching the apple, a down move remains possible, preventing trapping."
