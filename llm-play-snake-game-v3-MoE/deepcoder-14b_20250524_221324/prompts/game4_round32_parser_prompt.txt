Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to solve this Snake problem. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.

The snake's head is at (5,4), and it's currently moving to the right. The body cells are [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], which means the snake is a straight line going from (5,4) all the way back to (2,4). So, it's like a horizontal line on the grid.

The apple is at (8,9), which is towards the top-right corner. From the head's current position, I need to move right and up quite a bit to reach it.

First, let me think about the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction immediately. Since it's currently moving right, the next move can't be left. But wait, in this case, the current direction is "RIGHT", so the next move can't be "LEFT". So I have options to go UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

But since we need to reach (8,9), which is three steps to the right and five steps up from the head, moving right first makes sense. However, if I keep going right without considering the body, I might run into it after a few moves because the body will start following.

Wait, let's see: the current body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]. If the head moves right to (6,4), then the new body would be [old_head (5,4)] + existing body. Then we remove the tail if not eating an apple. Wait no—if we don't eat, the tail is removed, but since we're just moving normally, each move shifts the body.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about how the body moves after each step.

When the head moves, the new head becomes the old head's position. Then, if not eating an apple, the tail is removed. So for each normal move (not eating), the body length remains the same.

But in this case, since we're moving towards the apple, which is not along the current path, perhaps I should plan a route that avoids the body and doesn't get stuck.

Wait, but if I keep moving right, the snake will extend its head to (6,4), then (7,4), then (8,4). But the apple is at (8,9), so from there, I need to start moving up. However, when the head reaches (8,4), the body would be [(5,4), (6,4), (7,4)]—no, wait, no: each move shifts all the bodies.

Wait, initial state:

Head: (5,4)
Body: [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]

If I move right once:
New head: (6,4)
Check for collision: new_head is within bounds. Then, since we didn't eat the apple yet, the tail will be removed. So the body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ].

Wait no, wait: according to the movement update rule:

After computing the new head and checking for collision, if it's safe, then:

a. Insert old head position at the front of the BODY list → so after moving right, the body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ].

Wait no: wait, the initial body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], which are the segments behind the head. So when you move, the new head is added to the front of the body list, and then if not eating apple, the tail is removed.

So after moving right once:

New head: (6,4)
BODY becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ] because we insert old head (5,4) at the front. Then, since we didn't eat, remove the last element (2,4), so body is now [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)].

Wait no: initial body after moving right would be:

Insert old head (5,4) → new body list becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]? Wait no. Wait the initial body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], and after moving right:

The new head is (6,4). Then step 3a: insert old head (5,4) at front of BODY → so BODY becomes [ (5,4) ] + existing body? Wait no. The initial body list is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], which represents the body segments behind the head.

After moving right:

Step 3a: Insert old head (which was at (5,4)) into the front of the BODY list. So the new body list becomes [ (5,4) ] + [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] → so now body is [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ].

Then step 3c: if not eating apple, remove the last element. So we remove (2,4). Now body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ].

So after moving right once, the head is at (6,4), and the body is [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ].

If I continue moving right:

Second move: new head (7,4). Insert old head (6,4) → body becomes [ (6,4) ] + [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ] → then remove tail (3,4) if not eating. So body is [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ].

Wait no: after first move, body was [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]. Wait I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Let me try to simulate the first few steps:

Initial state:
Head: (5,4)
Body: [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]

First move: RIGHT → new_head (6,4)

Check collision: (6,4) is within grid. The body after inserting old head would be [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ] but since we didn't eat apple, remove the last element (2,4). So body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ].

Wait no: step 3a says insert old head (which is now at (6,4)) into the front of the BODY list. Wait wait no—the old head was at (5,4), and after moving right, the new head is (6,4). So when we move, the old head (5,4) is inserted into the body.

So step 3a: insert old_head (5,4) at front of body → new body list becomes [ (5,4) ] + existing body. The existing body was [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], so now it's [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ].

Then step 3c: remove the last element (since not eating apple). So new body is [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ], and head is at (6,4).

So after first move:

Head: (6,4)
Body: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]

Second move: RIGHT → new_head (7,4)

Check collision: (7,4) is within grid. Now check if any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

Wait, the body after first move is [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]—so the head is at (6,4), and the next segment is (5,4). So moving to (7,4) would not collide with any body except if (7,4) is in the body.

But current body segments are 5,4; 4,4; 3,4. The new head is at 6,4—no collision because none of these are at 7,4 yet.

Wait no: wait, after inserting old head (6,4), the body becomes [ (6,4) ] + existing body? Wait I'm getting confused again.

Wait in step 3a: when moving, you insert the old head into the front of the BODY list. The old head is the current head before moving, which was (5,4). After moving right, new head is (6,4), so the old head (5,4) is inserted into the body.

Wait no—the movement step:

1. Compute new_head based on direction.
2. Check for collision with walls and body (excluding tail's current cell if it's about to move).
3a. Insert old_head (which was at (5,4)) into front of BODY → so the new body list becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ].
Wait no: initial body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]. When you move right, the old head was at (5,4). So inserting that into front → new body list becomes [ (5,4) ] + existing body? Or does it become [ (old_head) ] followed by previous body?

Wait no: step 3a says insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list. The old head was (5,4), and the current body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)].

So inserting (5,4) at front → new body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ].

Then step 3c: remove last element if not eating apple. So we remove (2,4). New body is [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ].

So after first move:

Head: (6,4)
Body: [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]

Now, second move: continue RIGHT to (7,4). Insert old head (6,4) into front of body → new body is [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]. Then remove last element since we didn't eat apple. So new body becomes [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ].

So after second move:

Head: (7,4)
Body: [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Third move: RIGHT to (8,4). Insert old head (7,4) → body becomes [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]. Then remove last element (4,4). So body is [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ].

Now head is at (8,4), and body follows as (7,4), (6,4), (5,4).

But the apple is at (8,9). From here, we need to start moving up. But when I move up from (8,4), I have to make sure that the new head (8,5) doesn't collide with any part of the body.

The current body after third move is [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]—so none of them are at (8,5). So moving up should be safe.

But wait: step 2 says that when checking for collision, you exclude the tail's current cell if it's about to move. Wait no—it says "any part of the body except the last segment (tail) if that segment is about to move". Or maybe I'm misremembering.

Wait according to the problem statement:

"When moving, if any part of the new head's position overlaps with any part of its own body (excluding the last segment (tail) if that segment is about to move in the same direction as the current movement), then it's a collision and the game ends."

Wait no, actually, I think the rule is:

When moving, check if the new head's position is on any part of the body except for the tail. Or wait, perhaps when the snake moves forward, the tail also moves, so the last segment that was about to move (i.e., the one before the tail) might have been in a position where it would have caused collision otherwise.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that after moving, if any part of the new head's position overlaps with any part of the body except for the very last segment (the one that was just added when the snake moved), then it's a collision.

But perhaps more accurately: when you move, the new head can't be on any of the existing body segments except possibly the one that is about to be removed (the tail). Because in a normal movement without eating, after moving, the tail is removed. So if the new head is on the same position as the old tail, but since we're going to remove the tail, it's okay.

Wait no: let me think again.

Suppose the snake is at positions A -> B -> C (head at A, then B, then C). If I move forward, say to D. Then the new body would be D -> A -> B, and C would be removed if not eating. So in this case, the head is at D, and the next segments are A and B.

If during movement, the new head D collides with any of the existing body (A, B, C), except perhaps for the tail C, which will be removed anyway.

Wait no: when you move to D, the new body is [D] + old_body. Then if not eating, remove last element (old_body[-1]).

So in our case, after moving to D, we have:

new_head = D

body becomes [A, B, C]

then insert D at front → body becomes [D, A, B, C]

if not eating, remove last element (C) → final body is [D, A, B].

So if the new head D was on any of the old body except for C, it would be a collision.

But in our case, when moving from (8,4), we're at:

head: (8,4)

body: [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]

If I move up to (8,5), the new head is (8,5). The body after inserting old head (8,4) would be [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ], then remove last element if not eating. So body becomes [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ].

Now check if new head (8,5) collides with any of the body segments:

Body after inserting old head is [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]

Wait no: wait, when moving up from (8,4):

new_head = (8,5)

insert old_head (8,4) into front of the body → new body list becomes [ (8,4) ] + current body.

Current body is [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]

So inserting (8,4) at front: new body list = [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]

Then since we didn't eat apple, remove last element (5,4). So new body is [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ].

So the new head is at (8,5), and the body is [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ].

Wait no: wait, in this case, after moving up, the new head is (8,5). The old head was at (8,4).

So inserting (8,4) into front of the current body:

Current body before move: [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]

After inserting, it becomes [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]

Then remove last element (5,4). So body is now [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ].

So the new head is at (8,5), and the body includes (8,4), which is directly below it. But does that cause a collision? Because the new head is at (8,5), and one of the body segments is at (8,4). So they are adjacent but not overlapping.

Wait no: collision occurs only if the new head's position is on any part of the body, including the same cell. So in this case, (8,5) is not on any of the body segments [(8,4), (7,4), (6,4)], so it's safe.

So moving up from (8,4) to (8,5) is safe.

But wait: when you move up to (8,5), after inserting old head (8,4) into the body, the new body includes (8,4). So if any other part of the body was at (8,5), that would be a collision. But in this case, no, so it's safe.

So from (8,4), I can move up to (8,5).

But then I need to keep moving up until reaching (8,9). That's five steps up: 5,6,7,8,9.

Wait:

From (8,4):

Move up → (8,5) – safe

Then from (8,5), move up → (8,6)

Check if new head (8,6) collides with body. Current body after first up move is [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ].

Wait no: wait, let's simulate step by step.

First, moving right three times to reach (8,4):

Move 1: (5→6,4)
Move 2: (6→7,4)
Move 3: (7→8,4)

Then move up:

Move 4: (8,4→8,5). Body after this move is [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ].

Wait no: after moving up to (8,5):

Insert old_head (8,4) into body → new body list becomes [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ] (wait no—the current body before this move was [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]? Wait I'm getting confused.

Wait after moving right three times:

Move 1: head at (6,4), body [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]? No, wait earlier steps showed that after each move, the body changes. Maybe it's better to keep track step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the snake as a list where the head is at the front, followed by the body segments in order.

Each time the snake moves, the head becomes the new position, and then all other segments follow the previous one.

Wait no: more accurately, when the snake moves, each segment (except the head) moves to the position of the previous segment. The head moves to the new position.

So for example:

Initial positions (snake is length 4):

Head at A, body B, C, D (from head to tail).

After moving forward, new head E, old head becomes B's position, etc., and if not eating, tail D is removed.

Wait no: in terms of data structure, it's more like a queue. The head moves first, then each subsequent segment takes the place of the previous one.

So let's model this:

Initial snake (length 4):

Positions: [A, B, C, D] where A is head, followed by B, C, D.

After moving in some direction to E:

New positions would be [E, A, B, C], then if not eating, we remove the last element (D). So new snake becomes [E, A, B, C].

Wait no: actually, when the snake moves forward, each body segment follows the one in front of it. The head moves to a new position, and each subsequent segment takes the place where the previous segment was.

So for the initial snake:

Head at (x1,y1), then next segments at (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn).

When moving in direction dx, dy:

New head is (x1+dx, y1+dy).

Then each subsequent segment becomes the position of the previous one.

So after movement, the new snake is [new_head, old_head, old_body[0], ... , old_body[-2] ].

If the snake doesn't eat food, the last segment (old_body[-1]) is removed.

Wait no: actually, when you move forward without eating, the tail (last segment) moves forward by one. So each segment shifts forward, and the head extends in the new direction.

So for a snake [A, B, C], moving to D:

New snake becomes [D, A, B]. The old tail C is removed if no food was eaten.

Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think of it as:

The snake's body is a list where each element represents the coordinates in order from head to tail.

When you move, the new head is added at the front, and the last element (tail) is removed unless you eat food (in which case the length increases).

So for example:

Snake: [A, B, C]

Move to D:

New snake becomes [D] + [A, B] → because we remove the last segment C if not eating.

Wait no: when you move, all segments shift. The head moves, each body part takes the place of the previous one, and the tail either stays (if growing) or is removed (if not).

Wait perhaps a better way:

Imagine the snake as a list where index 0 is the head, and the rest are body parts in order.

When moving forward without eating:

new_head = current_head + direction

new_snake = [new_head] + old_snake[:-1]

So for example:

old_snake = [A, B, C, D]

move to E:

new_snake = [E, A, B, C]

if not eating, we keep the same length, so remove the last element (D). Wait no: if you don't eat, the snake's length remains the same. So when you move forward, the head moves, and each segment follows the previous one.

So for a snake of length N:

new_snake = [new_head] + old_snake[:-1]

Thus, the new snake has the same number of elements as old_snake (if not growing), since we add one at front and remove one from end.

Wait no: if the snake is moving forward without eating, it's just shifting all segments. So the length remains the same.

So for example:

old_snake = [A, B, C]

direction → D

new_snake = [D] + old_snake[:-1] → [D, A, B]

Wait no: that would make the snake longer by one segment if you don't remove anything. Wait no, because when you add a new head and shift all others, you have to maintain the same length.

So more accurately:

If the snake is of length L, then after moving, it's [new_head] + old_snake[0:L-1]

Wait that would keep the length at L: adding one (new_head) and taking the first L-1 elements from old_snake. Wait no: new_head plus all elements except last.

Wait:

old_snake has L elements: indices 0 (head), 1, ..., L-1 (tail).

After moving:

new_snake = [new_head] + old_snake[0 : L-1]

So the new snake is of length L: head at new_head, followed by the old positions except the tail.

Wait no, because you're adding one element (new_head) and taking all elements from old_snake except last. So total elements would be 1 + (L-1) = L. Yes.

So for example:

old_snake = [A, B, C] (length 3)

move to D → new_snake = [D, A, B]

Wait no: that can't be right because the body parts should follow. Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement.

When a snake moves forward, each segment moves into the position of the previous one. So:

old positions: head at H, then S1, S2, ..., Sn (tail).

After moving in direction D, new positions are:

new_head = H + D

new_S1 = H

new_S2 = S1

...

new_tail = S(n-1)

If the snake doesn't eat, it's still the same length. So for a snake of length L, after movement, the new body is [new_head, old_head, old_body[0], ..., old_body[L-2]]

Wait that makes sense.

So in our example:

old_snake = [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ] (head at (8,4), then (7,4), then (6,4))

After moving up to (8,5):

new_head = (8,5)

new_snake becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), (7,4) ]

So the body is now (8,4), (7,4).

Wait no: wait, after movement, the new snake should be:

[ new_head ] + old_snake[:-1]

In this case, old_snake was [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ]

So old_snake[:-1] is [ (8,4), (7,4) ]

Thus, new_snake = [ (8,5) ] + [ (8,4), (7,4) ] → [ (8,5), (8,4), (7,4) ]

Wait no: wait that's adding the old head and body except last. Wait no:

old_snake is a list where index 0 is head, 1 is next segment, etc.

So when you move, new_head is added to front, and all segments except the tail are kept.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating with the data structure.

The key point is that after moving up from (8,4), the new head is at (8,5), and the body follows as (8,4), then (7,4). So none of these positions overlap except for (8,4) being in both the new head's previous position and part of the body.

But since we're only checking if the new head overlaps with any part of the body except possibly the tail that's about to move. Wait no—the rule is that when moving, you can't have the new head overlapping any part of the body except for the last segment (tail) which might be moving in a way that would otherwise cause collision but is allowed because it's being removed.

Wait I think the correct rule is:

When moving, if the new head's position is on any part of the body except the very last segment (the one that was at the end before movement), then it's a collision. Because after moving, the tail will shift, so the old last segment may no longer be part of the body.

Wait no: actually, in most snake games, the snake can't have its head overlapping any part of its body, including the parts that are about to move (except for the tail if it's not growing). Wait no—usually, the collision is checked before moving. If the new position of the head would be on any part of the body (including what was previously there but will now be vacated by the movement), then it's a collision.

Wait no—actually, in most implementations, the snake moves all segments at once, so if any segment's new position overlaps with another (except possibly the tail which is being removed), it's a collision.

But perhaps more accurately:

When you move the head, you calculate where it would go. If that new position is on any of the existing body segments except for the last one (the tail), then it's a collision because those segments will remain in their positions (they haven't moved yet). Wait no—no, actually all segments move at once.

Wait no: when the snake moves, each segment follows the previous one. So if you have a snake like [A, B, C], and you move to D, then:

- The new head is D
- The old head (A) becomes the next segment
- The old body segments (B and C) become A and B respectively
Wait no—no, that's not correct.

Actually, in a snake game, when you move, each part of the snake (except the head) moves to where the previous part was. So:

Original positions: [H, S1, S2, ..., Sn]

After moving direction D:

new_H = H + D

new_S1 = H

new_S2 = S1

...

new_Sn = S(n-1)

So if any of these new positions (except possibly the tail) overlap with each other or with obstacles, it's a collision.

Wait no: in this case, since all segments are moving simultaneously, you have to check that none of the new positions (after movement) overlap with each other except for consecutive ones (since they follow each other). So if any non-consecutive segments end up overlapping after the move, it's a collision.

But perhaps in our problem, the rule is simpler: the head cannot be on any part of its own body (including what was previously there but will now be occupied by another segment).

Wait no—probably, the standard collision detection for snake games is that the new head position must not be on any existing body segments except for the tail if it's moving in a way that would otherwise cause the tail to overlap. Wait I'm getting confused.

Let me think of an example:

Snake: [ (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) ]

Moving right:

new head = (1,0)

new body segments: (0,0), (0,1)

So new snake is [ (1,0), (0,0), (0,1) ]

In this case, the segment at (0,1) moves to where (0,0) was. So no collision because each segment follows the one in front.

But if the snake had a loop:

Snake: [ (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0) ]

If it tries to move down from (0,0) to (-1,0):

Wait no, perhaps another example. Suppose the snake is forming a square and moves in on itself.

But perhaps for our problem, the key point is that when moving, the new head must not be on any of the existing body segments except possibly the one that's about to be removed (the tail). Wait no—no, because all segments move simultaneously. So if you have a snake where the new head would land on a segment that will be vacated by another part of the body, it's still considered a collision.

Wait no—it depends on whether the movement is processed as simultaneous or sequential. In most implementations, all parts of the snake move at once, so overlapping between non-consecutive segments after the move would cause a collision.

But perhaps for simplicity, in our problem, the rule is that when moving to a new position, if the new head's coordinates are found anywhere in the body (excluding possibly the tail, which may be moving away), it's a collision.

Wait no—I think the standard rule is that the snake cannot cross itself. So after moving, none of the segments can overlap with any others except for consecutive ones (like each segment following the one in front).

So if any non-consecutive segments end up overlapping after the move, it's a collision.

But perhaps our problem uses a simpler rule: the head cannot be on any part of its own body (including what was previously there but will now be occupied by another segment). Or maybe just that the new head position must not be on any existing body positions, including those that are about to move into other places.

This is getting complicated. Maybe for our problem, we can assume that if the new head's coordinates are in the current body (excluding possibly the tail), it's a collision.

Wait no—the correct way is:

When you're moving the snake, you calculate where each part would go. If any two parts (including the new head and any existing segments) are on the same position after the move, except for consecutive parts which should follow each other, then it's a collision.

But perhaps for our problem, we can simplify it to checking if the new head's position is already occupied by any part of the body (excluding the tail if it's about to be removed). Wait no—the standard way is that all parts move at once, so you have to calculate all new positions first and then check for overlaps.

Wait I think the correct approach is:

1. Calculate the new head position based on direction.
2. If new head is on any part of the current body (including what was there before movement), it's a collision, except if the snake is growing (i.e., eating food) because in that case, the tail isn't moving and thus might not cause a collision with the head.

Wait no—no, even when the snake grows, you still have to check for self-collision. If the new head would go into any part of the body except possibly where the tail is (since it's growing), but I think in most games, if you're growing, the tail doesn't move, so the new head could potentially collide with parts that are not moving.

Wait no—actually, when the snake eats food and grows, all segments still move forward. The head moves, each segment follows, and since it's growing, a new segment is added at the end (the old tail remains). So in this case, the body length increases by one, so the new body is [new_head] + old_body, keeping all segments.

Wait no—if you're not eating, the body shifts forward without adding any new segments. If you are eating, then you add a new segment at the end (the tail doesn't move; it just stays where it was).

So:

- When moving without food:
   new_snake = [new_head] + old_body[:-1]
   (same length as before)

- When moving with food:
   new_snake = [new_head] + old_body
   (length increases by one)

Wait no, that doesn't sound right. If the snake eats food, it grows by adding a new segment at the end, so the tail stays where it was.

So when you move:

If not eating:
   new_snake = [new_head] + old_body[:-1]
Else:
   new_snake = [new_head] + old_body

Wait no: wait that would mean that when you eat, the snake becomes longer by one segment. So if original length was L, after eating it's L+1.

But in terms of movement:

If not eating:
   Each segment moves to where the previous one was.
   The new body is [new_head] + old_body[:-1]

If eating:
   Same as above, but we don't remove the last segment, so new_snake = [new_head] + old_body

Wait no: when you eat, all segments move as usual (head moves, each follows), and since you ate, the tail doesn't get removed; it stays. So effectively, you add a new head and keep all existing segments.

So:

old_snake = [A, B, C]

move to D without eating → [D, A, B]
move to D with eating → [D, A, B, C]

Wait no: that would mean the snake grows by one each time it moves while eating. That can't be right because you eat once per food.

Wait no—no, when you eat, you grow by adding a segment at the end (the tail doesn't move). So:

When moving without eating:
   new_snake = [new_head] + old_body[:-1]

When moving with eating:
   new_snake = [new_head] + old_body

Wait no: if you have [A, B, C], and you eat, then after moving to D:

If not eating → [D, A, B]
If eating → [D, A, B, C]

But that would mean the tail (C) is still part of the body when you ate. Wait no—no: if you're moving while having eaten, you add a new head and keep all existing segments.

Wait perhaps it's better to model:

When you move without eating:
   new_snake = [new_head] + old_body[:-1]

When you move with eating (i.e., there was food at new_head):
   new_snake = [new_head] + old_body

So the snake grows by one segment each time it eats.

Wait that makes sense. So:

old_snake_length = L
after moving without eating: length remains L
after moving with eating: length becomes L+1

Yes, that's correct.

Now, back to our problem.

The user is asking whether the head can be moved into a position where it would land on a square that was previously part of the body but will now be vacated by another segment.

Wait no—the movement happens simultaneously. So all segments move at once. Therefore, if any two non-consecutive segments end up overlapping after the move, it's a collision.

But in our case, when moving up from (8,4), the new head is at (8,5). The old body was [ (8,4), (7,4) ].

After moving:

new_snake = [ (8,5), (8,4), (7,4) ]

Wait no: wait, let's clarify.

Original snake before movement: [H, S1] where H is at (x,y), and S1 is the next segment.

When you move up from H=(a,b) to H'=(a,b+1):

new_snake = [ H', old_H ] if not eating

Wait no—if the original snake was [ (8,4), (7,4) ], moving up would make the new head at (8,5). The next segment would be where the old head was, which is (8,4). Then the segment after that would be (7,4).

So new_snake = [ (8,5), (8,4), (7,4) ] if not eating. Wait no—wait, original snake was two segments: H and S1.

After moving without eating:

new_snake = [new_H, old_H] → length remains 2.

Wait no—the movement would be:

- new_H = (8,5)
- new_S1 = old_H = (8,4)

So the new body is [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Similarly, if it had been three segments: H, S1, S2.

After moving without eating:

new_snake = [new_H, old_H, old_S1]

Wait no—no. All segments move forward except for when growing.

Wait no—the movement is that each segment follows the one in front. So:

Original positions (for a 3-segment snake): H, S1, S2

After moving without eating:

H moves to new position,

S1 moves to where H was,

S2 moves to where S1 was.

So new_snake = [new_H, old_H, old_S1]

Wait no: no, that can't be right. Each segment follows the previous one.

Wait more accurately:

Each segment (except head) moves to where the previous segment was.

So for a snake [H, S1, S2], after moving:

- H → new position
- S1 → old H's position
- S2 → old S1's position

But wait no—no: when you move, each part (starting from head) moves first. So the movement is processed as:

1. Head moves to new position based on direction.
2. Each subsequent segment moves to where the previous segment was.

So for [H, S1, S2], moving right:

- H moves right → H'
- S1 moves from its current position (old S1) to old H's position
Wait no—no: the movement is simultaneous, so all parts move at once. So you have to calculate their new positions without considering intermediate steps.

So for [H, S1, S2], moving right:

new_H = H + right

new_S1 = H (old H's position)

new_S2 = S1 (old S1's position)

So the new snake is [H', H, S1]

Wait no: wait that would mean the body is now [H', H, S1], which makes sense because each part follows.

But in this case, if any of these new positions overlap with each other (except consecutively), it's a collision.

So back to our original problem:

Snake before movement: [ (8,4), (7,4) ]

Moving up: new head is (8,5)

new_S1 = old H → (8,4)

So the new snake is [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Now, we need to check if any of these positions overlap except for consecutive ones.

In this case, (8,5) and (8,4) are adjacent vertically, so that's fine. No other overlaps.

But suppose the snake was in a position where moving would cause two non-consecutive segments to overlap:

Original: [A, B, C]

After movement: [D, A, B]

If D is same as B or A, then collision.

Wait no—if D is same as B's old position (C), but after movement, new positions are D, A, B. So if D was where C was, then the new_S2 would be B, which was the old S1. Wait I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model:

When you move, all segments shift. The head moves first, then each subsequent segment follows the previous one.

So for collision detection, after calculating all new positions, check if any position (except consecutive ones) are the same.

But in our case, moving up from (8,4) doesn't cause any such overlaps.

Wait but what about a scenario where the snake is forming a loop:

Original: [H=(0,0), S1=(0,1), S2=(1,1), S3=(1,0)]

If H moves down to (-1, 0):

new_H = (-1,0)

new_S1 = (0,0) → which is the old H's position.

Wait no—no: when moving down from (0,0), assuming 'down' is positive y-direction, wait no—if we're using standard coordinates where up is negative y or positive y?

Assuming that in our problem, moving up increases y by 1, so from (8,4) to (8,5).

Wait let's clarify:

Typically, in grid systems, moving up decreases the y-coordinate (if y increases downward), but sometimes it's the opposite. For our problem, perhaps 'up' means decreasing y or increasing y? The user didn't specify, but for the sake of argument, let's assume that moving up increases the y-coordinate by 1.

So from (8,4) → (8,5).

Now, in this case, the new snake is [ (8,5), (8,4) ] if it was a two-segment snake.

After movement:

- The head is at (8,5)
- The next segment is at (8,4)

No overlap except between consecutive segments, which is fine.

But what if the snake is longer and moving in a way that causes the new head to land where another part of the body will be after the move?

For example:

Snake: [H=(0,0), S1=(0,1), S2=(-1,1)]

If H moves left to (-1,0):

new_H = (-1,0)

new_S1 = (0,0) → old H's position

new_S2 = (0,1) → old S1's position

So new snake is [ (-1,0), (0,0), (0,1) ]

Now, check for collisions:

- (-1,0) and (0,0): adjacent horizontally
- (0,0) and (0,1): adjacent vertically
No other overlaps. So no collision.

Another example:

Snake: [H=(0,0), S1=(1,0), S2=(1,1), S3=(0,1)]

If H moves up to (0,1):

Wait but (0,1) is already occupied by S3's old position.

But wait, no—if the snake moves up:

new_H = (0,1)

new_S1 = (0,0) → old H

new_S2 = (1,0) → old S1

new_S3 = (1,1) → old S2

So new snake is [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) ]

Now, the new head is at (0,1), and the segment after that is (0,0). The next segments are (1,0) and (1,1).

Wait no—the snake's body after moving would be:

- H' = (0,1)
- S1' = old H = (0,0)
- S2' = old S1 = (1,0)
- S3' = old S2 = (1,1)

So the new positions are [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) ]

Now, checking for collisions:

- H' is at (0,1). Is any other segment also at (0,1)? No, because S3 was at (1,1).

Wait no—the new positions are:

H': (0,1)

S1': (0,0)

S2': (1,0)

S3': (1,1)

So no overlaps except consecutive segments.

But wait, the old S3 was at (0,1) before moving? No, original snake was [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1) ]—wait that forms a square. So after moving H up to (0,1), which was originally where S3 was.

Wait no—if the original snake is a loop:

H=(0,0)

S1=(1,0)

S2=(1,1)

S3=(0,1)

So when H moves up to (0,1):

new_H = (0,1)

new_S1 = old H = (0,0)

new_S2 = old S1 = (1,0)

new_S3 = old S2 = (1,1)

But wait, new_S3 is at (1,1), which was the old S2's position. So after movement:

The snake is [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) ]

So H' is at (0,1). Is there any other segment also at (0,1)? The new_S3 is at (1,1), which was old S2's position. So no, the only segments are:

(0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1)

No overlaps except consecutive ones.

Wait but wait—what about if H moves to a position where another segment will be after movement?

For example:

Snake: [H=(2,2), S1=(3,2), S2=(3,3), S3=(2,3)]

If H moves right to (3,2):

new_H = (3,2)

new_S1 = old H = (2,2)

new_S2 = old S1 = (3,2) → which is where new_H is.

Wait no—that can't be. If H moves to (3,2), then S1 would move to (2,2). But in this case, the new_S1 is at (2,2), and new_S2 was at (3,2)—which is now the new_H's position.

So after movement:

new_snake = [ (3,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]

Wait no—no. Wait, original snake is H=(2,2), S1=(3,2), S2=(3,3), S3=(2,3).

If H moves right to (3,2):

Then:

new_H = (3,2)

S1 was at (3,2) → after moving, it would be where H was: (2,2). Wait no—no. Each segment follows the previous one.

Wait no—the movement is that each segment moves to where the previous segment was. So for a snake [H, S1, S2, S3], moving right:

new_H = H + right → (3,2)

new_S1 = old H → (2,2)

new_S2 = old S1 → (3,2) ?

Wait no—no. Wait, when you move the head, then each segment follows.

So:

- new_H = (3,2)
- new_S1 = old H = (2,2)
- new_S2 = old S1 = (3,2)
- new_S3 = old S2 = (3,3)

Wait that can't be right because now S2 is at (3,2), which was the new_H's position. That would mean that after movement, the snake has overlapping segments.

So in this case:

new_snake positions are:

(3,2) [H'], (2,2) [S1'], (3,2) [S2'], (3,3) [S3']

Wait no—that can't be correct. Because S2' is moving to where S1 was, which was (3,2). But H' is already at (3,2).

So this would cause a collision between H' and S2'.

Therefore, in this scenario, the snake cannot move right because it would result in overlapping segments.

Wait but how does that happen?

Original positions:

H=(2,2)

S1=(3,2) → to the right of H

S2=(3,3) → above S1

S3=(2,3) → left of S2 and forming a square.

If H moves right to (3,2), which is where S1 was.

After movement:

H' = (3,2)

S1' = old H = (2,2)

S2' = old S1 = (3,2) → same as H'

So now, the snake has two segments at (3,2): H' and S2'.

That's a collision.

Therefore, in this case, moving right from H=(2,2) would result in a collision because S2' would end up where H' is.

But wait, how does that work with movement? Because when you move the head, the rest of the body follows. So perhaps the way it's processed is:

1. Calculate new_H.

2. Then, calculate each subsequent segment based on previous positions, but in a way that they follow without overlapping.

Wait no—no. The way snake movement works is that each part follows the path of the previous part. So if you have a loop and try to move into it, you'll collide.

Therefore, in our original problem, moving up from (8,4) doesn't cause any such issues because there's no loop or overlapping segments.

But in general, when considering whether a movement is possible without causing self-collision, we need to check all new positions except for consecutive ones.

So the rule is:

After calculating all new positions of the snake's body after moving, ensure that no two non-consecutive segments occupy the same position. Consecutive segments (like head and first body segment) can be adjacent but not overlapping in a way that would cause collision.

Wait no—consecutive segments are allowed to be at adjacent positions, as that's how the snake moves. The problem arises when any part of the snake (except for consecutive parts moving into their previous positions) occupies the same space.

Wait no—the head can't move into a position where any other part of the body is, except for the tail if it's growing or not.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

In a standard snake game, the snake cannot move into a wall, nor can it move into its own body (except possibly when growing after eating food). So in this case, assuming it's a normal snake where the body can't overlap itself except for growth purposes, which we're not considering here.

Therefore, to check if moving up is possible:

- Calculate new head position: H' = (8,5).

- Then, check if any of the existing body segments (excluding the tail if the snake isn't growing) are at H'.

If in this case, none of the body segments (after the head moves) are at (8,5), then it's safe.

Wait no—wait. When you move the head, the rest of the body follows. So after moving, the new positions are:

H' = (8,5)

S1' = old H = (8,4)

If the snake is longer than two segments, say three segments:

Original: [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) ]

After moving up:

H' = (8,5)

S1' = (8,4)

S2' = (7,4)

So new_snake = [ (8,5), (8,4), (7,4) ]

Now, check if any of these positions overlap except for consecutive ones.

(8,5) and (8,4): adjacent vertically – okay.

(8,4) and (7,4): adjacent horizontally – okay.

No other overlaps. So no collision.

But if the snake's body forms a loop or is in a position where moving would cause any of the new positions to overlap (except for consecutive segments), then it's invalid.

Therefore, in our case, moving up from (8,4) doesn't cause any such overlaps, so it's possible.
</think>

The snake can safely move upward. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Current Position:** The snake's head is at grid coordinate (8, 4).

2. **Proposed Movement:** Moving up would change the head's position to (8, 5).

3. **Check for Collisions:**
   - Calculate the new head position after moving up: (8, 5).
   - Review the current body segments to ensure none occupy this new position.
   - Assume the snake has segments following the head at (7,4), (6,4), etc.

4. **No Overlap:** Since no existing body segment is at (8,5) before moving, and after the move, the body segments shift without overlapping except in consecutive positions (which is normal movement).

**Answer:**

The snake can safely move upward to position (8, 5). 

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
