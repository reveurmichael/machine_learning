<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get this snake from (7,1) to eat the apple at (0,0). Let's see... The snake is currently moving down, but that doesn't seem helpful because it's going away from the apple. Maybe I should change direction.

Wait, right now the head is at (7,1), and the body cells are all along the same column from (7,2) to (7,7). So the snake is like a vertical line on x=7. The apple is way down at (0,0), so I need to move left and up.

But how do I change direction without reversing? Since the current direction is DOWN, I can't switch to UP next because that would be reversing. So maybe I should go LEFT first to start moving towards the apple.

If I move LEFT from (7,1), the new head would be at (6,1). I need to check if this is okay. The grid boundaries are 0-9 for both x and y, so (6,1) is within bounds. Also, it's not occupied by any body segments except maybe the tail. Wait, the body is [ (7,2), (7,3), ..., (7,7) ]. So the new head at (6,1) isn't overlapping with any of those, so that's safe.

After moving left to (6,1), the body will update. The old head (7,1) becomes the first body segment. Since the new head is not on an apple, we remove the tail, which was at (7,7). So now the body is [(7,1), (7,2), ..., (7,6)]. The snake's length remains 7.

Next move, I can't go DOWN again because that would reverse. Maybe try LEFT again to get closer. Moving left from (6,1) gets me to (5,1). That seems okay too. No body segments are there, and the new head is within bounds.

Continuing this way, each time moving LEFT until I reach x=0. From (7,1), moving left six times would get me to (1,1). But wait, the apple is at (0,0), so maybe I need more moves or a different path.

Alternatively, after moving left several times, perhaps I can change direction. Since I'm at (5,1) after two LEFT moves, if I then move UP, that would be changing direction from LEFT to UP without reversing. Is that allowed? Yes, because the current direction is LEFT, and UP isn't the opposite.

Moving UP from (5,1) takes me to (5,2). Now I'm moving vertically upwards. But that's taking me further away from the apple at (0,0). Hmm, maybe that's not the best path.

Wait, perhaps a better strategy is to move UP first after some LEFT moves to get closer diagonally. Let me think: starting at (7,1), if I move LEFT to (6,1), then UP to (6,2), then LEFT to (5,2), and so on. This way, I'm moving in a diagonal direction towards the apple.

But I need to ensure that each step is safe. Each new head position must not collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it's about to move. Also, I can't reverse directions unless it's the first move.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, the snake's body grows by one segment. So if I manage to get the head to (0,0), I need to make sure that there's still a way for the snake to move without getting trapped.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Start at (7,1) facing DOWN.
2. First move: LEFT to (6,1). Body becomes [(7,1), (7,2), ..., (7,6)]. No apple eaten.
3. Next move: LEFT again to (5,1). Body becomes [(7,1), (7,2), ..., (7,5)].
4. Continue moving LEFT until x=0 is reached. That would take several steps.
5. Once at x=0, say (0,1), then move UP towards y=0.

Wait, but the apple is at (0,0). So from (0,1), if I move DOWN to (0,0), that's where the apple is. But moving DOWN would require checking if it's allowed.

Let me count how many steps:

Starting at x=7:
- Move LEFT 6 times: each step reduces x by 1.
So after 6 LEFT moves, head is at (1,1). Then move UP once to (1,2), then LEFT again to (0,2). Wait, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe a better path involves turning UP earlier. For example:

After moving LEFT twice to (5,1), then move UP to (5,2). Then continue LEFT towards x=0 and y=0.

Each time I move UP or LEFT, I need to ensure the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it moves.

Also, after each move, I must check if the new head is on the apple. If it is, the snake grows by one segment, which might affect future moves.

But in this case, the apple is at (0,0). So if my head gets there without eating the apple, that's not helpful unless I can eat it in the next move.

Wait, to eat the apple, the new head must be on (0,0) and not have eaten it yet. So maybe the last step before reaching (0,0) should be a move that brings the head close enough to eat the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is to go diagonally towards (0,0). Since Manhattan distance from (7,1) to (0,0) is 7 + 1 = 8 steps. But since each step can change x or y by 1, it's possible to reach in up to 8 moves.

But I need to plan a path that avoids reversing directions and doesn't cause collisions.

Let me try to sketch a path:

1. (7,1) -> LEFT -> (6,1)
2. (6,1) -> LEFT -> (5,1)
3. (5,1) -> LEFT -> (4,1)
4. (4,1) -> LEFT -> (3,1)
5. (3,1) -> LEFT -> (2,1)
6. (2,1) -> LEFT -> (1,1)
7. (1,1) -> LEFT -> (0,1)
8. (0,1) -> DOWN -> (0,0)

Wait, but moving from (0,1) to (0,0) would require a DOWN move. Is that allowed? Let's see:

- Current direction is LEFT at (0,1). Moving DOWN changes direction to DOWN, which is not the reverse of LEFT, so it's allowed.

But before moving DOWN to (0,0), I need to check if that move is safe. The new head would be (0,0), which is where the apple is.

So when I move from (0,1) to (0,0):

- Check collision: new head at (0,0). Is this cell occupied by any body segments except the tail?

The current body segments are [(7,1), (7,2), ..., (7,6)]. The new head is at (0,0), which isn't in the body list. So no collision.

Then, since it's eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment. So the tail remains at (0,7) or wherever it was.

Wait, no: when you eat the apple, you don't remove the tail that turn. So the body length increases by 1.

So after step 8, the head is at (0,0), and the body segments would be [(0,1), (7,1), (7,2), ..., (7,6)]. Because we inserted the old head (0,1) at the front and didn't remove the tail.

But I need to ensure that after eating the apple, there's still a legal move. So from (0,0), what directions are possible? Since the last move was DOWN to get here, the next direction can't be UP unless it's the first move.

Wait, no: the current direction is DOWN. The next move could be LEFT or RIGHT, but not UP because that would reverse.

But in this case, from (0,0), moving UP isn't possible because y=0 is the minimum. So maybe the snake can still move LEFT or RIGHT, but since it's at x=0, moving LEFT isn't possible either. Wait, no: after eating the apple, the direction remains DOWN until changed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the last step. Let me re-examine.

After step 7, head is at (0,1), facing LEFT. To reach (0,0), I need to move DOWN, which would change direction from LEFT to DOWN. Is that allowed? Yes, because LEFT and DOWN are not reverses.

So moving DOWN to (0,0):

- New head is (0,0).
- Since this is the apple, the snake grows by one segment. So the tail doesn't move; it stays where it was.
- Now, the body includes [(0,1), (7,1), ..., (7,6)].

After that, from (0,0), what directions are possible? The current direction is DOWN, which would take the head to (0,-1), which is out of bounds. So that's not allowed.

But maybe I can change direction. Since I'm at (0,0) facing DOWN, I can't move further down. But perhaps turning around isn't possible because that would reverse directions.

Wait, no: the current direction is DOWN, and reversing would mean going UP. Is that allowed? No, because you can only change direction if it's not a reversal unless it's the first move.

But since this isn't the first move after eating the apple, I can't reverse from DOWN to UP immediately. So maybe I need another way.

Alternatively, perhaps before reaching (0,0), I should have turned in such a way that there are possible moves afterward.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the initial path of moving LEFT 6 times and then UP once isn't efficient, but it might work.

Alternatively, let me try to plan a different path:

1. From (7,1) -> LEFT to (6,1)
2. (6,1) -> LEFT to (5,1)
3. (5,1) -> UP to (5,2)
4. (5,2) -> LEFT to (4,2)
5. (4,2) -> UP to (4,3)
6. (4,3) -> LEFT to (3,3)
7. (3,3) -> UP to (3,4)
8. (3,4) -> LEFT to (2,4)
9. (2,4) -> UP to (2,5)
10. (2,5) -> LEFT to (1,5)
11. (1,5) -> UP to (1,6)
12. (1,6) -> LEFT to (0,6)
13. (0,6) -> DOWN to (0,5)
14. (0,5) -> DOWN to (0,4)
15. (0,4) -> DOWN to (0,3)
16. (0,3) -> DOWN to (0,2)
17. (0,2) -> DOWN to (0,1)

Wait, this is taking me all the way up and then down again. That seems inefficient.

Alternatively, maybe a more diagonal approach:

After moving LEFT to (5,1), move UP to (5,2). Then LEFT to (4,2), UP to (4,3), etc., until I reach x=0 and y=0.

But this might take too many steps and may not be necessary. Perhaps there's a shorter path.

Another idea: after moving LEFT 6 times from (7,1) to (1,1), then move UP once to (1,2). Then move LEFT again to (0,2). But that still leaves me at y=2, not y=0.

Alternatively, maybe combine moves:

From (7,1):

1. LEFT to (6,1)
2. UP to (6,2)
3. LEFT to (5,2)
4. UP to (5,3)
5. LEFT to (4,3)
6. UP to (4,4)
7. LEFT to (3,4)
8. UP to (3,5)
9. LEFT to (2,5)
10. UP to (2,6)
11. LEFT to (1,6)
12. UP to (1,7)
13. LEFT to (0,7)

Now I'm at (0,7). The apple is at (0,0), so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe a better strategy is to move towards the apple while avoiding reversing directions.

Wait, perhaps after moving LEFT several times and then UP enough times to reach y=1, then move DOWN towards y=0.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to outline a specific path step-by-step:

1. (7,1) -> LEFT to (6,1)
2. (6,1) -> LEFT to (5,1)
3. (5,1) -> LEFT to (4,1)
4. (4,1) -> LEFT to (3,1)
5. (3,1) -> LEFT to (2,1)
6. (2,1) -> LEFT to (1,1)
7. (1,1) -> UP to (1,2)
8. (1,2) -> LEFT to (0,2)
9. (0,2) -> DOWN to (0,1)
10. (0,1) -> DOWN to (0,0)

This seems like a possible path:

- Steps 1-6: move LEFT from x=7 to x=1.
- Step 7: UP to y=2 at x=1.
- Step 8: LEFT to x=0, y=2.
- Steps 9-10: move DOWN twice to reach (0,0).

At step 10, head is at (0,0), which is the apple. So the snake grows by one segment. The body becomes [(7,1), (7,2), ..., (7,6), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), ...] up to total 8 segments.

Wait, no: after eating the apple at step 10, the body includes all previous segments plus the new head. So the tail remains at its last position before eating the apple.

After this move, from (0,0) with direction DOWN, can the snake move further? No, because moving DOWN would take it out of bounds. But perhaps changing direction is possible.

But since the current direction is DOWN, to change to UP or LEFT/RIGHT requires not reversing unless it's the first move after eating.

Wait, from (0,0), facing DOWN, what moves are allowed? Only LEFT and RIGHT if within bounds, but x=0 can't go further left. So only option is to face a different direction without reversing.

Alternatively, perhaps before reaching (0,0), I should have turned in such a way that allows the snake to move after eating the apple.

This seems tricky. Maybe another approach: use a combination of LEFT and UP moves to get diagonally closer.

But honestly, I'm getting stuck trying to plan all these steps without making mistakes. Perhaps it's better to try to find a minimal path using as few moves as possible while avoiding collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial idea of moving LEFT six times and then UP once isn't sufficient because y=1 is still far from y=0.

Wait, after 6 LEFT moves, I'm at (1,1). Then moving UP once to (1,2), but that doesn't help towards y=0.

Maybe from (1,1), move DOWN to (1,0). But wait, the apple is at (0,0), not (1,0).

Alternatively, perhaps after being at (5,1) as in step 3, moving UP to (5,2), then LEFT to (4,2), UP to (4,3), and so on until reaching x=0.

Let me try:

From (7,1):

1. LEFT to (6,1)
2. UP to (6,2)
3. LEFT to (5,2)
4. UP to (5,3)
5. LEFT to (4,3)
6. UP to (4,4)
7. LEFT to (3,4)
8. UP to (3,5)
9. LEFT to (2,5)
10. UP to (2,6)
11. LEFT to (1,6)
12. UP to (1,7)
13. LEFT to (0,7)

Now I'm at (0,7). That's not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 4: (4,3), instead of moving UP again, move LEFT to (3,3), then UP to (3,4), etc.

But this seems like it's taking too long and not getting me closer to the apple.

Maybe I need a different strategy. Let me think about the minimal number of moves needed.

The Manhattan distance from (7,1) to (0,0) is 7 (x) + 1 (y) = 8 steps.

But each move can only change x or y by 1, so it's possible to reach in 8 moves if moving directly. But since we can't reverse directions except initially, we need to plan a path that alternates between LEFT and UP without reversing.

For example:

Move 1: LEFT
Move 2: UP
Move 3: LEFT
Move 4: UP
...
This way, each pair of moves gets me one step closer diagonally.

So after 8 such moves (four pairs), I would reach (0,0).

But let's count:

Starting at (7,1):

1. LEFT to (6,1)
2. UP to (6,2)
3. LEFT to (5,2)
4. UP to (5,3)
5. LEFT to (4,3)
6. UP to (4,4)
7. LEFT to (3,4)
8. UP to (3,5)

Wait, that's only 8 moves and I'm at (3,5). Not yet (0,0).

Hmm, maybe after reaching a certain point, I need to move DOWN towards y=0.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving in a diagonal manner until x=1, then move DOWN to reach (0,0).

Let me try:

Starting at (7,1):

1. LEFT to (6,1)
2. UP to (6,2)
3. LEFT to (5,2)
4. UP to (5,3)
5. LEFT to (4,3)
6. UP to (4,4)
7. LEFT to (3,4)
8. UP to (3,5)
9. LEFT to (2,5)
10. UP to (2,6)
11. LEFT to (1,6)
12. UP to (1,7)
13. LEFT to (0,7)

Still not helpful.

Alternatively, after moving diagonally until x=1:

From (7,1):

1. LEFT 6 times: (1,1)
2. Then UP once: (1,2)
3. Then LEFT once: (0,2)
4. Then move DOWN to reach y=0: (0,0)

But step 4 would require moving DOWN twice from y=2 to y=0.

So total moves:

- 6 LEFT
- 1 UP
- 1 LEFT
- 2 DOWN

That's 10 moves. Plus the initial 6 LEFT and other steps, maybe it works.

Yes, that seems like a viable path without reversing directions.

So step-by-step:

1. (7,1) -> LEFT to (6,1)
2. (6,1) -> LEFT to (5,1)
3. (5,1) -> LEFT to (4,1)
4. (4,1) -> LEFT to (3,1)
5. (3,1) -> LEFT to (2,1)
6. (2,1) -> LEFT to (1,1)
7. (1,1) -> UP to (1,2)
8. (1,2) -> LEFT to (0,2)
9. (0,2) -> DOWN to (0,1)
10. (0,1) -> DOWN to (0,0)

This is 10 moves in total.

At move 10, head reaches (0,0), which is the apple. So the snake grows by one segment, and now has 8 segments: starting from (7,1) through each move up to (0,0).

Now, after reaching the apple, the snake's next move would be in the opposite direction of its current movement, but since it just moved DOWN into (0,0), I think it can choose any direction, but probably will go back towards increasing y.

But for the purposes of this problem, we only need to find a path that the snake can take to eat the apple without violating movement rules. So the above 10-move path seems valid.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves required is 10.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the shortest path for a snake starting at position (7,1) on an infinite grid, moving only left or up, to reach the apple located at (0,0). The snake cannot reverse direction in consecutive moves unless it's the initial move after eating the apple.

### Approach
The goal is to find a path that alternates between moving left and up as much as possible without reversing direction. This ensures that each pair of moves brings the snake closer diagonally towards the target. 

1. **Initial Left Moves**: The snake first moves left from x=7 to x=1, which requires 6 consecutive left moves.
2. **Adjust Vertical Position**: After reaching x=1, the snake moves up once to y=2.
3. **Final Left Move**: From (1,2), the snake moves left to (0,2).
4. **Descending to Apple**: Finally, the snake moves down twice from (0,2) to (0,1) and then to (0,0).

This approach ensures that the snake does not reverse direction unnecessarily and reaches the apple efficiently.

### Solution Code
```python
# Define the initial position of the snake
initial_pos = (7, 1)
target_pos = (0, 0)

# Calculate the minimal number of moves
moves = []

# Move left as much as possible
for _ in range(6):
    moves.append(('left',))
    current_pos = (_ + initial_pos[0], initial_pos[1])

# Adjust vertically by moving up once
moves.append(('up',))
current_pos = (initial_pos[0] - 1, initial_pos[1] + 1)

# Move left to the last column
moves.append(('left',))
current_pos = (current_pos[0] - 1, current_pos[1])

# Move down twice to reach the target
for _ in range(2):
    moves.append(('down',))
    current_pos = (current_pos[0], current_pos[1] - 1)

print(len(moves))  # Output: 10
```

### Explanation
The snake starts by moving left six times from x=7 to x=1. It then moves up once to y=2, followed by another left move to x=0. Finally, it descends twice to reach (0,0). This results in a total of 10 moves without any reversals, efficiently reaching the apple.
