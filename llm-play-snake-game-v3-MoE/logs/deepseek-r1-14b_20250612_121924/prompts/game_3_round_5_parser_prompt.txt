========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (4,4) to (4,5) without causing a collision and following all the rules. 

First, I'll look at the current state. The head is at (4,4), and the body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0)]. So the snake is moving upwards from (4,4) down to (4,0). Wait, no—the body list goes from behind the head to the tail. So the first body part is right behind the head at (4,3). That means the snake's body extends straight down from the head.

The apple is at (4,5), which is directly above the head. The current direction is "UP," so if I choose another direction that isn't opposite to "UP", but wait—the rules say you can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is "UP", the next move cannot be "DOWN". So possible moves are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or stay as "UP".

If the snake is currently moving up, and I want to go towards the apple which is also in the UP direction, maybe I should continue going UP? But wait, the head is at (4,4), and the next cell above is (4,5). So if I move UP, the new head will be (4,5), which is exactly where the apple is.

Let me check for collisions. The body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0)]. When moving up, the new head would be at (4,5). I need to ensure this isn't occupied by any BODYi except possibly the tail when it moves. But in this case, the tail is at (4,0), which won't move because we're eating the apple.

Wait, no—when you eat an apple, the body grows, so the tail doesn't move. So after moving up to (4,5), since that's where the apple is, the body will grow by one segment. That means the new body list becomes [old head (4,4)] + current body [(4,3), ...], but wait no—the update step says that when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail. So the body length increases by one.

So let's simulate this:

1. Current state:
   - Head: (4,4)
   - Direction: UP
   - Body: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0)]
   - Apple: (4,5)

If I move "UP":
- New head: (4,5)
- Check collision: new_head is within bounds and not in any body cells except possibly the tail. The body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0)], so no overlap.
- Since new_head == apple position, we grow. So we add the old head to the front of the body list: [ (4,4) ] + current body = [ (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0) ]
- Then, since it's an apple, we don't remove the tail. So the new body becomes [ (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0) ] and the head is now (4,5).
- So the snake's new state would have a longer body.

But wait, we also need to check if after eating, there's at least one legal move. Since after eating, the body has grown, but the apple is no longer in the same position. The next move needs to ensure that moving doesn't cause the head to collide with any part of the body except perhaps the tail.

But in this case, the snake has just eaten the apple and grown by one segment. The new body includes all previous segments plus the old head. So now, the body is longer. But since the apple was at (4,5), which is directly ahead, moving up from there would take us out of bounds because y can't go beyond 9. Wait no—the grid goes up to (9,9). The current move takes the head to (4,5), which is within the grid.

Wait, after eating the apple, do we need to check if the next move is possible? Or is that only required when the snake just ate the apple and must have at least one legal move next turn. Hmm, I think the rule says that after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move on the next turn to avoid immediate trapping.

In this case, after moving up to (4,5), the next possible moves would be LEFT or RIGHT because we can't reverse direction from UP. Let's see:

The new head is (4,5). The body is [ (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0) ]. So if I choose to move LEFT next, the new head would be (3,5). Is that position safe? Well, we need to check collision with current body after shifting. The body will shift as follows:

- New head is (3,5)
- Insert old head (4,5) into body list: [ (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), ... ]
- Since we're not eating an apple this time, the tail will move, so the last segment (4,0) will be removed.

So after moving LEFT, the new body would be [ (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]. The head is now (3,5). Is this position safe? It's not in the body list except for possibly the tail which hasn't moved yet. Wait, no—the body after moving would be [ (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ], so (3,5) is not among these.

So moving LEFT seems safe. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (5,5) would also be a valid move as long as it doesn't collide with the body.

Therefore, choosing "UP" as the first move to reach the apple seems safe and possible without causing immediate issues.
</think>

The snake can move up directly to eat the apple, ensuring no collision and following all rules. After eating, there's at least one valid next move (LEFT or RIGHT).

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP"],
  "reasoning": "The head can safely move UP to reach the apple at (4,5) without causing any collisions."
}

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (4, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (4, 5). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
