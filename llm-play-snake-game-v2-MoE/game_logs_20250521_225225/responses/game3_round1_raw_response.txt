========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to help the snake move from (5,5) to eat the apple at (7,8) without dying. The snake can't reverse direction immediately, and it has to avoid its own body and the grid edges.

First, the snake is currently at position (5,5), facing none, which means any direction can be chosen initially as long as it's not reversing. To reach (7,8), the head needs to move right twice and up three times in some order because the Manhattan distance requires those specific net movements.

But I have to plan a path that ensures each move doesn't lead to a collision with the body or walls. Since there are no other body parts mentioned, except for the head at (5,5), moving directly towards the apple should be safe initially.

Let me consider possible directions:

1. Right: Moving right from (5,5) would take it to (6,5). Then another right to (7,5). From there, I need to move up three times.
2. Up first might also work but could potentially require more steps or hitting walls earlier.

Wait, moving RIGHT twice and then UP three times should get the snake directly towards the apple without any immediate issues because it's moving in a straight line, avoiding obstacles (since there are none). But I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause the head to go out of bounds. Since starting at (5,5), adding right twice would be within 0-9 for both x and y.

But hold on, after eating the apple, the snake should still have a legal move afterward. So if it's placed such that the only way back is blocked, that could cause issues. But since the problem doesn't specify any body parts beyond the head, I think moving straight towards the apple is safe.

So the sequence would be RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP, UP. Each step should check for collisions:

- After each move, the new position shouldn't go out of bounds or collide with previous positions (but since there are no other body parts except the head moving forward, it's just checking if the new head is within the grid).

Let me simulate this path:

1. Move RIGHT to (6,5)
2. Move RIGHT again to (7,5)
3. Then UP to (7,6)
4. UP to (7,7)
5. UP to (7,8)

Each of these steps should be valid as long as the new head doesn't go beyond 9 for x or y.

Yes, this path seems safe and leads directly to the apple without any immediate collision risks.

The snake can safely move towards the apple by moving RIGHT twice followed by UP three times. This ensures it reaches (7,8) without reversing direction immediately or colliding with walls or its own body since there are no other segments beyond the head.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move right twice to reach x=7 and then move up three times to reach y=8. This path avoids reversing direction immediately and ensures safe movement without collision."
}
```
