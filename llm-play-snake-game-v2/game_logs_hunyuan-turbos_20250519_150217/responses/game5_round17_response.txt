{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move left to decrease the x-coordinate from 9 to 6 and down to decrease the y-coordinate from 3 to 2. Moving left three times first avoids the body and aligns the snake horizontally with the apple, then moving down twice reaches the apple without collision."
