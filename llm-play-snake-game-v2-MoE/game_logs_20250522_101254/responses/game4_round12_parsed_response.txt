{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "UP", "UP"], "reasoning": "To reach the apple at (4, 2) from current position (6, 4), we first move UP to (7, 4). Then we move RIGHT to (7, 5). Since there is a wall at (7, 6), we have to go back one step by moving DOWN to (7, 5). Again we hit a wall at (7, 4) so we move LEFT to (6, 4). Now we are again at the same position but this time one step closer to the apple. We repeat the process of moving UP twice to finally reach the apple."}
