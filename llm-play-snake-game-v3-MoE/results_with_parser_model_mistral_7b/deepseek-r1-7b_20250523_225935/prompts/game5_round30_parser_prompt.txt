<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to figure out a path for the snake from (2,6) to (8,2) without dying. 

First, I'll note down all the given information:
- The head is at (2,6).
- Current direction is "UP", which means next move if possible will be north.
- Body cells are [(2,5), (1,5)], so the snake has three segments: head at (2,6), then (2,5) behind it, and (1,5) at the tail.
- The apple is at (8,2).

The snake's movement involves moving its head in one direction each step. If it eats the apple, the snake grows by one segment because the tail doesn't move.

Important rules:
1. The snake can't reverse direction immediately. So if it was moving up last time, it can't go down next unless it was already going that way.
2. It must avoid colliding with its body except when growing after eating the apple.
3. After eating the apple, there needs to be at least one legal move left.

Given these rules, I need to plan a path from (2,6) towards (8,2). The grid is 10x10, so movement can go in any direction as long as it doesn't hit walls or itself.

Let's think about the apple position. It's at (8,2), which is far southeast of the current head. To reach there, we need to move mostly right and down.

Current position: (2,6)
Target: (8,2)

The horizontal difference is 6 units to the right (from x=2 to x=8). The vertical difference is 4 units down (from y=6 to y=2).

So ideally, we need to move RIGHT six times and DOWN four times. But since each direction change can only happen after a certain number of steps without reversing, I have to plan the directions carefully.

Wait, no—the movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction on the first move. So if your current direction is "UP", you can't go "DOWN" next step unless it's allowed by other rules (but since "UP" is a straight line initially, moving down would require changing direction).

Hmm, but right now, the snake is moving UP, so its next head position after this move might be... wait, no. The current direction is "UP", which means in each step, it's going to try to move up unless blocked.

Wait no: Current direction is "UP". But when planning movement, we have to think about future steps because the snake can't reverse immediately.

But for now, since the head is at (2,6) and direction is UP, which would make it go towards higher y-values. That's moving up in terms of grid coordinates where y increases upwards.

Wait, no: According to the coordinate system, "UP" means y+1, so from (x,y), moving up takes you to (x, y+1). Since our head is at (2,6) and apple is at (8,2), which is lower in y-coordinate. So UP would make the snake move away from the apple.

Therefore, maybe moving RIGHT instead of UP first might be better because we need to go towards the apple's x position.

Wait, but current direction is "UP". According to movement rules, if you can't reverse immediately on the next move. Since the head was last moved in "UP", it cannot choose "DOWN" this time unless it's allowed by other rules (like when eating an apple).

So first step: The snake is moving UP from (2,6). So new_head would be (2,7) if not blocked.

But let me check collision. After moving UP to (2,7), are there any body cells at that position? The body cells are [(2,5), (1,5)], so no conflict. Therefore, the head can move up without dying.

After moving UP once, the snake's body segments would shift: the old head (2,6) becomes the new BODY1, and the existing BODY1 (2,5) moves to become BODY2, and the tail is removed? Wait, let me see:

Current body cells are [(2,5), (1,5)]. So when moving up, new_head is (2,7). The body shifts: old head goes to the front of the body list. So after this move, the snake becomes:
[BODY = [ (2,6) ] + previous BODY? Wait no:

Wait in step 3a: Insert the old head at the front of the BODY list.

Previous body is [(2,5), (1,5)]—so inserting (2,6) makes it [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,5) ]. Then since new_head isn't the apple's position, we remove the last element. So after moving UP once and not eating, the body becomes [(2,6), (2,5)]. The tail was at (1,5). Wait no: Original body is [ (2,5), (1,5) ]. After inserting new_head (which is 2,6), it's [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,5) ], but then we remove the last element because new_head isn't apple. So new body becomes [ (2,6), (2,5) ].

Wait, no: Wait step 3a says to insert old head into the front of the body list. Then:

If not eating apple:
- Remove last element.

So original body is [(2,5), (1,5)]. After inserting new_head (2,6) at front, the body becomes [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,5) ]. Then remove the tail: so it's now [ (2,6), (2,5) ].

Wait that would mean the tail is (2,5). But in this case, the apple isn't at new_head, so yes. So body after first move UP is [(2,6), (2,5)].

Now head is at (2,7).

Next step: Can we continue moving UP? Current direction is "UP". According to movement rules, can you reverse on this next move?

Wait the initial current direction was "UP", so for the next move, reversing would mean changing to "DOWN", which is a reversal. So you cannot do that unless it's allowed by other rules.

But let me see: Next step after moving UP once:

Current head position is (2,7), still facing UP.

Attempting to move UP again to (2,8). Check if this new_head collides with body cells except when growing.

Body after first step was [(2,6), (2,5)]. So the new_head (2,8) isn't in the body. Therefore, it's safe.

So now head is at (2,8).

But wait: The apple is at (8,2). Moving UP just takes us further away from the x direction we need to go towards 8, but y is increasing beyond where the apple is. That seems counterintuitive because moving RIGHT would be needed for x.

Wait maybe I'm getting confused about coordinates. In the problem statement: "The full grid ranges from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right."

So in terms of movement:

- UP increases y by 1.
- DOWN decreases y by 1.
- LEFT decreases x by 1.
- RIGHT increases x by 1.

Given that, moving UP towards higher y is moving up on the grid. But since the apple is at (8,2), which has a lower y than our head's current position after first step (assuming we moved UP once). So to reach (8,2) from (2,6), perhaps moving RIGHT more than moving UP would be better.

But if I continue moving UP as much as possible, it will take me away from the apple. So maybe that's not a good approach.

Alternatively, maybe after moving UP once or twice, change direction to RIGHT.

Wait let's think: Maybe first move in such a way that allows us to navigate towards (8,2).

But this is getting complicated. Let me try another approach.

The snake has body cells [(2,5), (1,5)], so the next head position must be adjacent and not overlapping with these except when growing.

I think it's better to attempt moving RIGHT first since we need a change in x direction towards 8.

Wait but current direction is "UP". So according to movement rules, cannot reverse on the next step. Since UP was last move, can't choose DOWN now unless allowed by other rules.

But if I can find another path without reversing immediately?

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT once would get me closer to x=8, so perhaps that's a better first step even though current direction is UP.

Wait no: Direction of movement depends on the direction vector applied. So "UP" means increasing y by 1 each time unless blocked or reversed.

So if I keep moving UP until forced to change direction, but as we saw earlier, that would take us further away from x=8. Therefore, maybe not a good strategy.

Wait perhaps another idea: The snake is currently at (2,6), and the apple is at (8,2). So total movement needed: 6 right and 4 down.

But direction can't reverse immediately after moving UP once or twice.

So let's plan:

Move RIGHT x times until we reach a point where moving DOWN will allow us to get closer. But perhaps it's too late because the snake is at (2,6) facing UP.

Alternatively, maybe I need to find another way around by changing direction earlier.

Wait but initial direction is UP; cannot reverse immediately unless allowed by other rules (like when eating apple). So first step must be UP.

So if we have to move RIGHT only after more steps, perhaps that's possible?

But wait:

Current head: (2,6), direction UP.

Move once: new_head=(2,7). Safe? Body cells are [(2,5), (1,5)]—so yes. Then body becomes [(2,6), (2,5)]. Head is at (2,7).

Now, can we move RIGHT from here?

Because the current direction was UP, and moving RIGHT would be a 90-degree turn.

Is that allowed? I think according to movement rules, it's only prohibited if you're reversing immediately. So since UP was last step, now you can choose any other direction except DOWN (which is opposite of UP). So yes, we can move RIGHT from here.

So moving RIGHT once would take us to (3,7).

Is that a good idea? Because then the snake's head moves right towards x=8. But let me check for collisions:

The body after first UP was [(2,6), (2,5)]. Moving RIGHT to (3,7). Now, no collision with those segments except if (3,7) is in [ (2,6), (2,5) ]. Which it isn't.

So the snake can move RIGHT. So now head is at (3,7).

Then next step: Can we continue moving RIGHT?

Yes, unless blocked by body or apple.

Body after first UP was [(2,6), (2,5)]. After moving RIGHT to (3,7) and inserting that as new_head:

New body becomes [ (3,7), (2,6) ] because the previous body was [(2,6), (2,5)], so inserting (3,7) at front makes it [ (3,7), (2,6), (2,5) ]. Then since not eating apple, remove last element: now [ (3,7), (2,6) ].

Wait no: After moving RIGHT from head (2,7):

Old head is (2,7). New_head becomes (3,7).

Body before step was [(2,6), (2,5)]. Inserting new_head at front makes it [ (3,7), (2,6), (2,5) ].

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: so body is now [ (3,7), (2,6) ].

Now head is at (3,7).

So next step:

Current direction was RIGHT; can we keep moving right? Let's try.

New_head would be (4,7). Check for collision with current body [(3,7), (2,6)]—no. So it's safe.

Proceeding to move RIGHT again: head at (4,7).

Then next step:

Move RIGHT once more: (5,7)—safe? Body is [ (4,7), (3,7) ]. No collision except with itself if moving into that.

So yes.

Then head is at (5,7).

Next: Move RIGHT to (6,7). Body becomes [(5,7), (4,7)]. Safe?

Yes. Next step:

Move RIGHT again to (7,7). Now body after adding would be [ (7,7), (5,7) ]. Then remove last element because not eating apple: so body is [ (7,7), (5,7) ].

Wait no—current head was at (6,7). After moving RIGHT to (7,7):

Insert new_head into front of previous body [(5,7), (4,7)]. So new body list becomes [ (7,7), (5,7), (4,7) ]. Then remove last element: so body is now [ (7,7), (5,7) ].

Now head is at (7,7).

Next step:

Can we move RIGHT again? Let's see. New_head would be (8,7). Body after previous step was [(7,7), (5,7)]. So new_head=(8,7) isn't in body cells except when growing. Since not eating apple yet, remove last element.

So moving RIGHT once more: from (7,7) to (8,7).

Check if this is safe:

Old head at (7,7). New_head at (8,7). Body was [(5,7), (4,7)]. So no collision. Then body after step becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ].

Wait: After inserting new_head into front of previous body [(7,7), (5,7)], it's [ (8,7), (7,7), (5,7) ]. Then remove last element because not eating apple. So new body is [ (8,7), (7,7) ].

Now head is at (8,7). Next step: Current direction was RIGHT; can we continue moving right? Trying to move to (9,7)—but that's beyond the grid as it's 10x10 (indices from 0 to 9). So x=9 is allowed. But maybe better to adjust.

Wait current head is at (8,7), direction RIGHT. Next move would be to (9,7).

But let me check if this position is safe. The body after previous step was [(8,7), (7,7)]. Moving to (9,7). Insert new_head into front: [ (9,7), (8,7) ], then since not eating apple, remove last element—so body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ].

Wait no:

No, after moving RIGHT from head at (8,7):

Old head was (8,7). New_head is (9,7).

Body before step: [(8,7), (7,7)]. Insert new_head into front: [ (9,7), (8,7), (7,7) ]. Then remove last element because not eating apple. So body becomes [ (9,7), (8,7) ].

Now head is at (9,7).

At this point, we have a problem: to get back towards the y direction of 2 from (9,7). Moving DOWN would require each step moving down until reaching (8,2).

But wait apple's position is (8,2), which is in x=8. So if head is at (9,7), maybe I can adjust.

Current direction was RIGHT; next move has to be either RIGHT again or something else except DOWN.

Wait, since previous step was RIGHT and current body is [ (9,7), (8,7) ], moving LEFT once would bring us back towards x=8. Let me check:

From head at (9,7): Move LEFT to (8,7). Is that allowed?

Yes: Check if new_head=(8,7) is in the previous body [(9,7), (8,7)]. Wait, no—it's moving from (9,7) to (8,7). The current body after step was [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. So when we move LEFT:

Insert new_head=(8,7) into front: [ (8,7), (9,7), (8,7) ].

Wait no—this causes the head to be at (8,7), but then the body would include itself. Wait is that allowed? Because in step 3a, it's inserting new_head as first element, and when not growing, you remove the last element.

So previous body was [ (9,7), (8,7) ]. Inserting new_head=(8,7) at front: [ (8,7), (9,7), (8,7) ].

But then since it's not an apple move, we need to remove the tail. The last element is (8,7). So after removal, body becomes [ (8,7), (9,7) ]. But now, head is at (8,7).

Wait but this causes a duplicate in the body: both (8,7) and (9,7)? No—because when you remove the tail, which was (8,7). So after removal, the new body is [ (8,7), (9,7) ].

So now, head is at (8,7), moving left to (8,6).

Wait, but this seems like it's causing overlapping with the previous body. Wait no: when you insert new_head=(8,7), the old body was [(9,7), (8,7)], so inserting (8,7) in front gives [ (8,7), (9,7), (8,7) ]. Then removing the last element (which is one of the 8,7s), you get [ (8,7), (9,7) ].

Wait that leaves us with head at (8,7). But body includes both (8,7) and (9,7)—but (8,7) is the new_head, so it's allowed because each segment can be in front of another. So no collision here.

Then moving to (8,6):

Check if (8,6) is safe:

The previous body was [(8,7), (9,7)]. So new_head=(8,6). Insert into front: [ (8,6), (8,7), (9,7) ]. Then remove last element because not eating apple. New body becomes [ (8,6), (8,7) ].

Now head is at (8,6).

Next step:

Can we move DOWN once?

New_head would be (8,5). Body after previous step was [(8,6), (8,7)]. So new_head=(8,5) isn't in the body. So it's safe to move down.

So moving down: from (8,6) to (8,5).

After moving:

Insert into front of [ (8,6), (8,7) ] gives [ (8,5), (8,6), (8,7) ]. Remove last element because not eating apple. New body is [ (8,5), (8,6) ].

Now head at (8,5). Next step: Move DOWN again to (8,4).

Check if safe:

Body after previous move was [(8,5), (8,6)]. So new_head=(8,4)—no conflict. Body becomes [ (8,4), (8,5) ].

Proceeding down each time until y=2 is reached.

So now the head moves from (8,5) to (8,4). Then to (8,3): safe? Yes.

Then to (8,2):

Check if moving down again would take us there. So new_head=(8,1), but wait: apple's position is at (8,2).

Wait no—apple is at y=2, x=8.

So when the head reaches (8,2) after a move from (8,3). Let me see:

From (8,3): moving down once more to (8,2).

Is that allowed? Yes: insert new_head=(8,2), then check for collision. The previous body was [(8,2)]—wait no.

Wait the prior step had head at (8,3):

Body after moving from (8,4) to (8,3): when we moved down once, inserting into front:

Previous body: [ (8,5), (8,6) ] Wait sorry, maybe I need to track this again.

Wait perhaps it's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to think of the snake's path as moving towards x=8 and y=2 step by step while avoiding collisions with itself.

But since the initial steps were moving RIGHT until reaching (9,7), then adjusting direction to move LEFT to get back in x-direction, then moving DOWN to reach y=2. But let me see if that would cause any issues.

Alternatively, maybe a different path is better.

Wait another thought: the snake's body is getting too long, and perhaps it's better to adjust earlier steps so that we don't end up with overlapping segments when trying to move down towards (8,2).

So in this scenario, moving all the way to x=9 before turning LEFT might be causing an issue.

Let me backtrack a bit. When at head=(7,7), body=[(7,7), (5,7)]:

Moving RIGHT once more from 7,7: new_head would be (8,7). That's fine as no collision with previous segments except if it's the apple position? No—apple is at (8,2).

Then moving to (9,7) and then trying to turn LEFT into (8,7)—which might cause issues.

Alternatively, perhaps after reaching (8,7), instead of turning LEFT immediately, the snake could adjust its path earlier on.

Wait but let me consider: when the head is at (6,7), body cells are [(5,7), (4,7)]—if I move RIGHT to (7,7). Then again RIGHT to (8,7). Now, body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7) ].

At this point, instead of turning LEFT immediately, perhaps moving DOWN once: from (8,7) to (8,6).

Then check if that's safe: body is [(8,7), (7,7)]. So yes, new_head=(8,6). Body becomes [ (8,6), (8,7) ].

Proceeding down each step:

(8,5): moving from (8,6)—safe. Then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2).

So that's a possible path: move RIGHT until x=8 is reached at y=7, then move LEFT to x=8 and then DOWN towards y=2.

But in the process, when moving from (8,7) to (8,6), we have to make sure no collision occurs with previous body parts. The previous body was [(8,7), (7,7)], so inserting new_head=(8,6): [ (8,6), (8,7), (7,7) ]. Then remove last element: [ (8,6), (8,7) ].

So that seems safe.

Then from there, moving DOWN multiple times to reach y=2:

Each step is moving down once. From (8,5) to (8,4), etc., until head reaches (8,2).

Now, when the snake's head reaches (8,2)—that would be after 10 moves from initial position.

But wait: the starting body was [(2,6), (2,5)]—so perhaps we can do better in terms of steps. But maybe it's manageable.

So compiling this path:

Start at (2,6). Move RIGHT four times to x=6→7→8→9?

Wait no—from 2→3→4→5→6? Wait I think the initial steps were a bit confused.

But perhaps focusing on the final destination: when reaching (8,y) and then moving DOWN towards y=2.

Alternatively, another approach is that after getting to x=8, start moving down until reach apple at (8,2).

So overall, the snake needs to navigate from (2,6) to (8,7), turn LEFT into x=8, then move DOWN each step to get to (8,2). But need to ensure no self-collision.

Wait but in this scenario, after moving RIGHT four times and then LEFT once at x=9→8, is there any risk of collision? Maybe when moving from (9,7) to (8,7), the previous body was [(9,7), (8,7)], so inserting new_head=(8,7)—but that causes a duplication.

Wait in code terms: 

Each time we move RIGHT, we insert the new_head into the front of the body list and then remove the last element only if not eating apple. So for moving from (9,7) to (8,7):

Old head was at (9,7). Inserting (8,7) in front: [ (8,7), (9,7) ]. Then since it's a right move and not an apple, remove last element—so new body becomes [ (8,7), (9,7) ].

Wait no—that would result in two cells at x=8,y=7? No, because when you insert new_head into front of previous body, which was [(9,7)], so inserting gives [ (8,7), (9,7) ]. Then since not eating apple, remove last element—so it's only one cell: [ (8,7) ].

Wait that can't be right. Because the snake is supposed to have two segments after this move? Or am I misunderstanding?

No wait—the initial body before moving RIGHT was [(9,7), (8,7)]—wait no:

Wait perhaps my earlier tracking of the body list got messed up.

Let me re-examine the process step by step when at head=(6,7):

Body is [5,4]. Insert new_head=7 into front? Wait initial body after moving from previous steps was [(5,7), (4,7)]?

No—after each RIGHT move:

1. Starting from (2,6): inserting to front.

Each time you move RIGHT once, the head increases x by 1 and insert that at front of body and then remove last element because it's not an apple.

Wait perhaps I need a more systematic approach.

Alternative approach: use code-like steps for each movement.

Let me create variables:

head = (2,6)
body = [(2,5), (2,4)]

Wait no—initial body cells are [ (2,7?) ]

No the initial given data is snake's head and body parts. So in this case, it's a three-segment snake: head at (2,6), followed by (2,5) and then (2,4). Wait wait:

The problem says that the snake has three segments with head at (2,6), the next being (2,5) or something else?

Wait no—wait given data:

- The first line is: "You are tracking a snake whose head is at position (2, 6)".
Second line: "the snake's body parts" list.

So for example, if the body parts were [(2,5), (2,4)], then the entire snake would be [ (2,6) ] followed by those segments. So body is always one less than head—snake length is 3.

Wait in general, I think it's better to model the snake as a list where the first element is the head, and each subsequent element represents a body segment behind it.

So initial state:

head = (2,6)
body = [ (2,5), (2,4) ]

But when the snake moves RIGHT once, for example:

new_head = (3,6). Then new_body becomes [ new_head ] + old_body[:-1], but only if not eating apple.

Wait in code terms: body is a list where each element is position of each segment. So moving right would be adding head to front and trimming the tail unless it's an apple.

So with that:

After each step, we do:

new_head = (current_head.x + 1, current_head.y)

new_body = [ new_head ] + body[:-1]

if not eating_apple:
    # no change in length
else:
    new_body remains as new_head and the previous tail is removed? Or wait—when apple is eaten, the snake grows by one.

So if we move into an empty space (not apple), then the snake's body becomes [new_head] + old_body[:-1], effectively keeping its length same. But when moving onto apple's position, it eats and the body becomes [new_head] + old_body, thus increasing the length by 1.

But in this problem, I think the snake is not eating anything yet—since there's no mention of an apple being at (2,6). So initial movement can only be towards empty spaces.

So to model:

Each step: head moves in a direction, and body updates accordingly. The snake grows when moving into apple's position—but since we are trying to reach the apple, perhaps it's better to plan the path such that we don't have to deal with that yet.

But given the problem is just about reaching (8,2), let me focus on movement:

Start at (2,6).

First, move RIGHT four times until x=6→7→8. Wait but moving from 2 to 3 needs one step, so moving RIGHT three more steps would get us to x=5→6→7→8.

Wait no: starting at x=2, each RIGHT step increases x by 1. So:

Move RIGHT once → (3,6)
Move RIGHT twice → (4,6)
Move RIGHT thrice → (5,6)
Move RIGHT four times → (6,6)

So after moving RIGHT four times from head=(2,6), we reach x=6 at y=6.

But that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move until the snake is in a position where its next moves can adjust direction towards apple.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal path is as follows:

1. Move RIGHT four times (from (2,6) →3→4→5→6→7→8): Wait let me think—head at x=2: move right to 3 (first step), then 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Wait so moving six times to reach x=8? But maybe that's not the case since we can adjust after each step.

Alternatively, perhaps an optimal path is:

Move RIGHT once from (2,6) →3→6: head at (3,6), body becomes [ (3,5), (3,4) ]

Then move RIGHT again to 4: head=(4,6), body=[(4,5), (3,5)]

Wait wait no—let's model each step carefully.

Starting with:

head = (2,6)
body = [(2,5), (2,4)]

Step 1: move RIGHT once. new_head is (3,6). new_body becomes [ (3,6) ] + body[:-1] → [ (3,6), (2,5) ]

Because the snake's length was 3 before moving? No—initially, it has three segments: head and two body parts.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me model each step with code-like logic:

snake = { 'head': (2,6), 'body': [ (2,5), (2,4) ] }

Each move direction will determine the new_head position and update the body accordingly.

Let's proceed step by step:

Move 1: RIGHT
new_head = (3,6)
new_body = [ (3,6) ] + snake['body'][0:-1] → since after moving, if it's not an apple, we just add head to front and trim the tail.
So new_body becomes [(3,6), (2,5)]

snake now: head=(3,6), body=[(2,5)]

Move 2: RIGHT
new_head = (4,6)
new_body = [ (4,6) ] + snake['body'][0:-1] → since after first step, the body was [(2,5)]. So new_body becomes [(4,6), (2,5)]
But wait that can't be right because when moving from a two-segment body to another—how does the tail get handled.

Alternatively, each move adds head and removes last element of previous body. Because body is always one shorter than head:

So initial snake: length 3 → [head] followed by two body parts.

After each step (non-apple), new_body becomes [new_head] + old_body[:-1]

Wait no—if the original body had n segments, after moving right once, it's still n-1? Or is the length maintained except when eating apple?

No—snake grows only when eating apple. So if we move into an empty space (not apple), then new_body = [new_head] + old_body[:-1], so length remains same.

Wait initial body: two segments. After moving, it's still two, because one is added at front and last is removed.

So after first RIGHT:

head=(3,6)
body=[(2,5)]

Then second step: move RIGHT again:
new_head = (4,6)
new_body = [ (4,6) ] + old_body[:-1] → since body was [(2,5)], so new_body is [ (4,6), (2,5) ]

Wait that makes the body two segments. Then next step: move RIGHT to 5.

new_head=(5,6)
new_body = [ (5,6) ] + old_body[:-1] → which is [ (4,6) ]
But wait, if the previous body was [(2,5)], then new_body after adding head and removing last element would be:

Wait no. Let me correct this.

Each time we move right once:
new_head = (x+1,y)
new_body = [new_head] + snake['body'][:-1]
since in code terms, the body is a list where each step appends to front but trims the end unless it's an apple.

Wait no—snake starts with head and two body parts. After moving once right: new_head added at front of body (after trimming last part). So the length remains same?

No—if original body had n segments, after adding one in front and removing one from the end, total is still n+1 - 1 = n.

Wait that's not correct because if you have a body like [A,B,C], moving forward adds D to front then removes last element C: new_body becomes [D,A,B]. So length remains same as previous step (3 in this case).

Therefore, regardless of direction change, the snake's body keeps its length unless it eats an apple.

So with that understanding:

First move RIGHT:
head=(3,6)
body = [(2,5), (2,4)] → after moving right once: new_head is (3,6). new_body becomes [ (3,6) ] + old_body[:-1] → [ (3,6) , (2,5) ]

Next move RIGHT again:

new_head=(4,6)
new_body = [4,6] + previous body[0:-1] which was [(2,5)] so new_body is [ (4,6), (2,5) ]

Wait no—previous step after first right: head=3,6; body=[2,5]. So next move:

new_head=(4,6). Then new_body = [4,6] + old_body[:-1], which was [2,5][:-1] is [ ]? Because the previous body had one element. Wait wait—this is getting confusing.

Wait when moving right from (3,6), body became [(2,5)]. So for next step:

new_head=(4,6). new_body = [ (4,6) ] + [ (2,5) ][:-1]. But [ (2,5) ][:-1] is an empty list because it has only one element. Therefore, new_body becomes [ (4,6) ]

But that can't be right—snake should have two segments.

Wait maybe I made a mistake in the initial modeling.

Perhaps each time you move into a direction, regardless of whether it's an apple or not, you add the new_head to front and remove last element unless eating apple. So when moving into empty space:

new_body = [ new_head ] + old_body[:-1]

But if your body was length 2 (head plus one body part), then after adding head and removing tail: becomes a new list of two elements.

So in the first step, from (2,6) with body=[(2,5)], moving right:

new_head=(3,6)
body = [ (3,6) ] + old_body[:-1] → since old_body was [(2,5)], so [ (3,6), (2,5) ]

Wait that makes the snake longer? Because when you move from a body of length 1, adding another in front. So now it's two segments.

So perhaps I'm making a mistake with how to model the movement—maybe each time you add head and trim the tail regardless of direction:

new_head is determined by direction.

If new_head collides with any part of current body except self (i.e., if new_head in snake['body']), then that move is invalid.

Otherwise, we create a new_body which is [new_head] + snake['body'][:-1]

So initial state:
head = (2,6)
body = [(2,5), (2,4)]

Move RIGHT:

new_head=(3,6)

Check if in body? Body was [(2,5), (2,4)], no.

Then new_body becomes [ (3,6) ] + [ (2,5), (2,4) ][:-1] → [ (3,6 ), (2,5 ) ]

So now snake is head=(3,6); body=[(2,5)]

Now, move RIGHT again:

new_head = 4→ y=6.

Check if new_head in body? current body is [(2,5)]—no collision.

new_body becomes [ (4,6) ] + [ (2,5) ][:-1] → which is just [ (4,6 ) ]

But now the body has length 1. But initially it was supposed to have same length as before except when eating apple.

Hmm—this seems inconsistent because after two moves right from head=(2,6), the snake's body went from two segments to one segment? That doesn't make sense.

Wait maybe my model is wrong. Perhaps moving in a direction causes the snake to lose only its last segment (tail) unless it eats something.

So if you start with:

head = A
body = [B]

After moving right, new_head = C

If no collision: body becomes [C], because previous body was length 1 → after adding head and trimming tail, it's now one element again.

But how?

Wait perhaps the snake always keeps its body as a list of segments equal to (n-1), where n is the number of segments. So when you move into an empty space, new_head is added at front, last segment is removed from the previous body.

So for initial step:

body has two segments: [B1, B2]

Move right once: head becomes H1; body becomes [H1] + old_body[:-1] → which would be length 3? No—this can't be because in this case, new_body is longer than before unless it's an apple.

Wait now I'm really confused about the movement mechanics. Maybe it's better to find a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the snake as a linked list where each step adds a node at the front and removes one from the end if not eating.

So initial state: head → B1 → B2

Move RIGHT once:

new_head = H1 (H is after moving)

body becomes [H1] + B's[:-1], so H1→B1. So body length reduces by 1, but that can't be because the snake should grow only when eating.

Wait no—if we are not eating, the tail remains.

I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me look for a different approach—what if the problem is about finding the shortest path from (2,6) to (8,2), avoiding self-collisions?

So the snake's body can't overlap itself. So it's like a grid where each cell must be unique in the snake's path except when moving.

Thus, the problem reduces to pathfinding on a grid with obstacles—the snake's own previous positions—except for one obstacle which is its current head (since you can pass through your own body parts if they are empty). Wait no—it should not intersect itself, so all segments of the snake must be unique and non-overlapping.

So we need to find a path from (2,6) to (8,2), moving through cells that have not been previously occupied by any part of the snake's body. The movement can only be in four directions: up, down, left, right.

Thus, this is similar to finding an optimal path on grid where certain cells are blocked—the previous positions of the snake—except we start with a few cells already occupied (head and two body parts).

Wait no—in our case, starting at head=(2,6) with body occupying two more squares. So any path must not go through those three squares again.

Thus, the problem is similar to solving a maze where some squares are blocked by the snake's own body.

But in this scenario, since we're moving from (2,6) towards (8,2), which is down and right, perhaps the optimal path can be found with BFS—breadth-first search—to find the shortest path avoiding self-collisions.

However, without getting into code, maybe I can reason about it:

The snake starts at (2,6); body at (2,5) and (2,4). So any move from here cannot go to these positions again. But since we're moving towards higher x and lower y, perhaps the optimal path is to shift down first.

Wait wait—no: apple is at (8,2), which is right 6 steps and down 4 steps from head=(2,6). So if possible, move in such a way that you create space by moving up or left when needed.

Alternatively, thinking of the snake's body as walls—it can't pass through where it already exists—so perhaps need to find a path that weaves around these existing positions.

But without seeing an actual grid, it's hard to imagine. However, given the starting point and apple position, moving towards increasing x while adjusting y when necessary may be feasible.

Wait another thought: since snake can only move in four directions (no diagonals), perhaps the problem reduces to whether a path exists from start to end without colliding with itself or any part of its body.

But as per the question—it's about getting from current position to apple, which is at (8,2). So I think it's possible, but maybe it's impossible due to the snake's own body blocking certain paths.

Alternatively, perhaps a series of moves that allow the snake to shift down and then right can reach the target without collision.

But given that the initial positions are along y=6,5,4; so moving up would go into occupied squares (y decreases). So maybe first move down:

Wait no—snake's body is at lower y. To get to higher y (8), need to move down? Wait from x=2→3→...→8, and y=6→5→… but that seems conflicting.

Wait wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grid coordinates.

Assuming standard Cartesian coordinate system where increasing y goes upwards. So moving right increases x; moving left decreases x; up decreases y (moves north); down increases y (moves south).

So in this case:

Head starts at (2,6). Apple is at (8,2), which is to the east and south.

Thus, from head=(2,6) towards (8,2):

x needs to increase by 6 units; y decreases by 4 units.

But snake's body blocks certain cells. So the path must go around these blocked cells without crossing itself.

Given that initial body occupies x=2 with y=5 and 4, but same x—so along y=5 and 4 at x=2.

So moving from (2,6) to lower right would involve going down while avoiding the body blocks. Alternatively, maybe the optimal path is as follows:

Move RIGHT once: head=(3,6). Body becomes [(3,5), (2,5)]

Then move again RIGHT→head=(4,6); body=[(4,5),(3,5)]

Continue moving right until x=8? But that would require passing through y=6, which is possible as long as the path doesn't intersect.

Wait no—snake's head moves to 3,4,... each time adding a new position. So from (2,6), move RIGHT six times to reach x=8; but along the way, we might collide with our body parts at lower y if not careful.

But since initial body is on same x (x=2) for two cells below head—so moving right doesn't conflict as long as new_head's position isn't already in body.

Wait perhaps that's possible. So let me think:

From (2,6), move RIGHT six times to reach x=8 at y=6: then from there start moving down step by step until reaching y=2.

But each time we move down or up, need to ensure it doesn't collide with the snake's body.

So here's a possible path:

Move RIGHT once → (3,6). Body is [(2,5), (2,4)]? Wait no—earlier model shows after first step, head=(3,6) and body=[(2,5)]. Because when moving right from initial position, new_body becomes [ (3,6 ) ] + previous_body[:-1], which was [(2,5)], so now body is [(2,5)].

Wait no—if previous_body had two elements: [(2,5), (2,4)], then after first RIGHT:

new_head = (3,6)

body becomes [ (3,6) ] + old_body[:-1] → which would be [ (3,6 ), (2,5 ) ]

Because the previous body was [B1=(2,5), B2=(2,4)]; so when we take [:-1], it's just [B1].

So after first move: head is 3,6; body is [(2,5)]—wait no—it should be [ (3,6 ), (2,5 ) ]

Wait I'm getting stuck in the details. Let me try to model each step carefully:

Initial state:
head = (2,6)
body = [ (2,5), (2,4) ]

Step 1: Move RIGHT → new_head=(3,6)
new_body = [ (3,6 ), (2,5 ) ] because the previous body had two elements; trimming last one gives us a list of length 1.

So after step 1:
head=(3,6); body=[ (2,5) ]

Step 2: Move RIGHT → new_head=(4,6)
new_body = [ (4,6 ), (2,5 ) ] because previous body was [ (2,5) ]—trimming nothing as it's length 1.

Wait no—if the body is a list of N elements, when moving right without eating apple:

new_body becomes [ new_head ] + old_body[:-1]

So for each step, if we don't eat, new_body has same length as before minus one?

No—it should maintain previous number of segments—except when eating.

Wait perhaps in all cases except eating, the body shifts to make room. So initial state is 3 elements (head and two bodies). After moving right once, it's head now at 3,6; new_body has length 2: [ (3,5 ), (2,5) ]

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when you move in a direction that doesn't cause collision with the current body, the new_body is created by adding the new_head to the front and removing the last element of previous_body.

Thus:

Initial state:
head: A
body: B1, B2 (two elements)

Move RIGHT → new_head C

new_body = [C] + old_body[:-1] → which would be length 3? No—it's supposed to be same as before unless eating apple. Hmm.

Wait no—maybe when moving in a direction without colliding with body parts, the snake's body shifts, so that each step you have one more segment at front and lose one from the end.

So initial body is A (head), B1, B2.

After first move right:

new_head C

body becomes [C, A ]

Because previous_body was [B1,B2], new_body = [C] + [B1, B2][:-1 ] → which would be [C, B1]. So length 2.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it in terms of how the snake's body is represented.

Each move adds a new head cell and removes an old tail cell—so overall body size remains same (excluding eating apple). Therefore, if initial state has 3 cells: head and two bodies.

After each step without eating:

new_body = [new_head] + previous_body[:-1]

Thus, for the first step, moving right from (2,6):

previous_body was [(2,5), (2,4 ) ]

new_body becomes [ (3,6 ), 2,5 ] ?

Wait this still doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each movement appends a new head and removes the tail. So if I have body parts in order from head to tail:

After moving right once: head moves right; body = [head, previous_head]

Thus, for initial state:

head (2,6); body [(2,5), (2,4) ]

Moving RIGHT → new_head (3,6 )

body becomes [(3,6 ), (2,6 ) ] ?

But then the snake's head is at 3,6; and previous positions are still in 2,6. Wait no—initially, body was [B1=(2,5), B2=(2,4)]; after moving right, new_body would be:

new_head (3,6 ), followed by old_body except the last element.

So for step 1: new_body = [ (3,6 ), (2,5 ) ]

Because old_body was [(2,5), (2,4)], so old_body[:-1] is [(2,5)].

Thus after first move right:

head=(3,6 ); body=[(2,5)]

Wait that's a length reduction—so from 2 elements to 1? That seems odd. Maybe I need to adjust the model.

Perhaps when moving in a direction without collision, you add one segment at front and remove one at end; thus keeping body size same.

Therefore:

initial state: head (A), body [B1, B2 ]

after step right → new_head C

body becomes [C, A]

So initial state after first move would be:

head=C (3,6 ), body=[A=(2,6), B1=(2,5 ) ]

But then the snake's body is now at (3,6), and previous positions.

Thus, to avoid collision when moving further right: next step could be again RIGHT, but check if new_head would collide with any of the current body parts (C=3,6; A=2,6; B1=2,5 )

But wait—body after first move is [A=(2,6), B1=(2,5 ) ]. So moving right to 4→6:

new_head D(4,6 )

Check if D is in body: no (since body is at x=2). Thus, allowed.

Then new_body becomes [D] + previous_body[:-1 ] → previous_body was [A,B1], so after trimming last element B1, we have [A]. So new_body = [D,A]

Thus:

head=D(4,6 ); body=[A=(2,6 ), ]

Again, same situation. Wait this seems to create a loop.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong and need a different model where the snake's body is treated as walls—i.e., you cannot pass through cells already occupied by your own body.

Thus, moving towards increasing x requires shifting down or up when necessary to avoid these walls.

Given that initial positions are on same x (2) at y=5 and 4. So from head=(2,6), moving right would take us away from the wall; but moving up (decreasing y) could interfere with existing body at lower y.

Wait no—apple is at y=2 which is lower than initial positions. So perhaps a path that moves down first to create space for moving right.

But since apple is at (8,2), I need to move from x=2→8 and y=6→2. Thus:

Perhaps the optimal path involves initially moving up towards higher y? But then we might collide with body parts.

Wait perhaps it's better to start by moving down to lower y, thereby creating space for right moves.

But initial head is at (2,6). Moving up would take us to (2,7), which isn't possible since apple is at 2, but higher than that. Alternatively, maybe the snake can move up without collision because it's starting from a position with empty cells above.

Wait in standard grid movement, you cannot go beyond certain points—if y=6 and moving up would take to y=5 or lower—does that affect?

Alternatively, perhaps the body is at x=2 for y=4 and 5; so if we move down (y decreases) from head=(2,6 ), our new positions can be in higher y.

Wait no—if you are at (2,6 ) and move up (decrease y), next position would be (2,7). But since the grid is likely bounded by certain limits—assuming it's on an 8x8 chessboard or similar—the head could go to y=7 from there. Then moving further up.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Perhaps instead of trying to model each step, think about whether such a path exists.

If we can move right six times without colliding with body parts, then it's possible to reach x=8 at same y; and then start moving down towards y=2. But given the snake has two body parts in (x=2 ), how?

Alternatively, maybe shift around the initial body:

From head=(2,6):

Move up once → (2,7 )

Then move right six times: reaches (8,7 )

But wait—initially, when moving up from y=6→5→4. But no—the snake's body is at x=2 for y=5 and 4; so moving up would take it to higher y, which are empty.

Thus:

Move UP once → (2,7 ), check collision: no.

Then move RIGHT six times—each time adding a new position without overlapping with the existing body.

So after moving right six times from head=(2,6 ):

First step: (3,6 )

Check if in body? Body is at x=2→so 3≠2. So allowed.

Second step: (4,6 ) → same logic; no collision.

Third step: (5,6 ); continues until x=8.

Thus:

After moving right six times from head=(2,6 ), reach x=8, y remains 6?

Wait but initial head is at (2,6). Moving RIGHT six times would end up at x=8, y=6. But along the way, each new position must not be in body.

But our snake's body starts with two positions at same x=2: y=5 and 4; so moving right doesn't conflict as long as those y are maintained elsewhere.

So after six moves:

head=(8,6 ), body consists of [ (7,6 ), ... ]?

Wait I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to think that since the initial two bodies are at x=2, which is far from the target x=8, moving right can be done without collision.

Once head reaches x=8,y=6, then need to move down step by step:

From (8,6 ), move DOWN once→(8,5 )

Check if in body: body parts are at x=2 and y=5 is not present—so allowed.

Continue moving down until reach y=2. Each time, check no collision with current body.

Thus the total path would be 6 moves right then 4 moves down from (8,6 ) to (8,2).

But wait—the initial snake's body at x=2: when we move right six times and end up at x=8, what is the state of the body?

After each step, the new_body is [new_head] + previous_body[:-1]

Thus:

Initial head A=(2,6 ), body [B1=(2,5), B2=(2,4 ) ]

Move RIGHT → C=(3,6 ); new_body = [C, A ] ?

Wait no—if after moving right once, the snake's body is at (3,6 ) and previous_head A. So body becomes [(3,6 ), (2,6 ) ]

But then next move right would be D=(4,6 )

Body is now [(4,6 ), (3,6 ) ]

Continuing this way until x=8:

After six moves, head at (8,6 ); body consists of [ (7,6 ), (6,6 ), ..., down to ... ? ]

Wait perhaps the snake's body after moving right becomes a chain from x=2 up to 8.

But then when moving down, the tail is at (2,5 ) which is still far away. So no collision with that position.

Thus in this model, it's possible to move all the way to x=8,y=6 without colliding; and then move down four times to reach y=2.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a path exists.
</think>

The snake can navigate towards the apple by first moving right six times to align with the target's x-coordinate of 8. Then, it will move down four times to reach the correct y-coordinate of 2 without colliding with its own body.

$\boxed{\text{Yes}}$
