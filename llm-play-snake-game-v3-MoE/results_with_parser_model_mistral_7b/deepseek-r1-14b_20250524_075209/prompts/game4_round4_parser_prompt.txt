<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (6,3) to eat the apple at (1,4). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (6,3), and it's moving DOWN. The body cell is [(6,4)], which means the tail is at (6,4). Wait, no—the body cells are given as [(6,4)], so that's behind the head, meaning the snake's body goes from head to body1, which is (6,4), and then the tail would be whatever comes next. But in this case, there's only one body segment, so the snake's length is 2: head at (6,3) and body1 at (6,4). Wait, no—wait, the body cells list starts from the segment immediately behind the head. So if the body is [(6,4)], that means after moving, the body will be that single segment.

Now, the apple is at (1,4). The goal is to move the head towards the apple without colliding with any part of the body or going out of bounds.

First, I need to figure out the direction. The current direction is DOWN, which means if the next move continues in the same direction, the new head would be (6,2), but that's not helpful because we need to go left towards x=1. However, the movement rules say that we can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP.

So possible directions from the current state are LEFT and RIGHT, as well as maybe others, but considering that DOWN is current, so next moves can't be UP.

Wait, no—the rule says you can't reverse. So if current direction is DOWN, next can't be UP; but if current is NONE (like at start), any direction is allowed. So in this case, since the current direction is DOWN, we cannot choose UP for the first move. But after that, I can change directions as needed.

But wait, in the initial state, the snake's body is [(6,4)], so the head is at (6,3), and body1 is (6,4). So moving in which direction would be safe?

Let me visualize the grid:

The head is at (6,3), which is somewhere on the right side of the grid. The apple is at (1,4), which is towards the top-left.

So to get from (6,3) to (1,4), the snake needs to move left several times and up once.

But given that the current direction is DOWN, meaning the last movement was DOWN, so the next move can't be UP. So I have to consider possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT, but moving RIGHT would take it further away from the apple's x-coordinate (since 1 <6). So probably better to go LEFT.

Wait, let me check:

Current head position: (6,3)
Apple at (1,4)

So to get there, the snake needs to move left several times and up once. But considering that the body is currently [(6,4)], moving DOWN would take the head to (6,2), but that's not helpful.

Wait, no—the current direction is DOWN, so if I choose a new direction, it can't be UP.

So possible next moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or maybe even DOWN again, as long as it doesn't reverse. Wait, wait: the movement rules say you can't reverse, i.e., if moving DOWN, you can't switch to UP on the next move, but you can switch to any other direction except for that.

So from current direction DOWN, possible next directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue in DOWN.

Wait no—the rule says you cannot choose the opposite direction. So if current is DOWN, you can't choose UP next; but you can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or perhaps NONE? Wait, the movement rules say that "current direction" is one of the four directions. So from a current direction (which isn't NONE), you can choose any other direction except the opposite.

So in this case, since current direction is DOWN, next move cannot be UP. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or maybe DOWN again? Or does that count as reversing?

Wait, no—reversing would mean moving back along the same line but opposite direction. So if you're going DOWN and then choose UP, that's reversing, which isn't allowed. But choosing another direction like LEFT is fine.

So from (6,3) with current direction DOWN, next possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

But moving LEFT would take the head to (5,3), which is towards the apple's x-coordinate of 1. Moving RIGHT would take it away, so better to go LEFT.

So first move: LEFT to (5,3).

Now, let's check for collisions. The body after this move would be:

Insert old head at front of body: [(6,3)] + current body [(6,4)], then remove tail unless we eat an apple.

Wait, but in the initial state, the body is [(6,4)]. So after moving LEFT to (5,3), the new head is (5,3). The body becomes [ (6,3), (6,4) ]? Or wait, no—the body cells are given as from the segment immediately behind the head. So when we move, the old head becomes part of the body.

Wait, let's think about it step by step:

1. Compute new_head: current direction is DOWN, but if we choose LEFT for the next move, that would be a valid direction since it's not opposite to DOWN.

So new_head = (6-1, 3) = (5,3).

2. Check collision: Is (5,3) inside grid? Yes. Now, does this position coincide with any BODYi except possibly the tail when it will move?

BODY cells are [(6,4)]. So new_head is (5,3), which is not in the body, so no collision.

So safe to proceed.

3. Update body positions:

a. Insert old head (6,3) at front of body list: new body becomes [ (6,3) ] + current body [(6,4)] → [ (6,3), (6,4) ]

b. Since new_head is not the apple position (apple is at (1,4)), we don't grow; so remove tail.

Current body after insertion is [ (6,3), (6,4) ]. The tail is (6,4), which is removed because no growth. So new body list becomes [ (6,3) ].

Wait, but the body list length was 1 before this move. After inserting old head, it's 2, then remove tail, so back to 1? Or wait:

Original body cells: [(6,4)] → that's one segment behind the head at (6,3). So after moving to (5,3), the new head is (5,3), and the body becomes [ (6,3) ] + [(6,4)], then if not growing, remove tail.

Wait, no—the insertion is before removing. Let me think:

After computing new_head, check for collision—safe.

Then, update body:

a. Insert old head (6,3) at front of current body list: [ (6,3), (6,4) ]

b. Check if new_head == apple? No, because apple is at (1,4). So we remove the tail: [ (6,3) ].

So after this move, the body is [(6,3)], and head is (5,3).

Wait, but that would make the snake's length 2 again. Because before moving, the body was [(6,4)]—so length 1 (head plus one body). After inserting old head, it's two segments, then remove tail if not growing. Since no growth, we have [ (6,3) ] as the new body.

So now, the snake is at head (5,3), body [(6,3)].

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you move, the old head becomes the first body segment, and then if not growing, the tail is removed. So let me think:

Original state: head (6,3), body [ (6,4) ]

After moving to (5,3):

- new_head = (5,3)
- body before shift: [ (6,4) ]
- insert old head at front → [ (6,3), (6,4) ]
- since not growing, remove tail → [ (6,3) ]
So the new body is [ (6,3) ]

But wait, that would leave the snake's body at (6,3), which is now behind the new head at (5,3). So the snake is now in a straight line: head at (5,3), body at (6,3).

Wait, but that seems like it's moving to the left, so the body should be behind. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe after inserting old head into the body list, the new body is [ (6,3) ], and then remove the tail only if not growing.

Wait no: when you insert the old head at the front of the body list, which was [(6,4)], it becomes [ (6,3), (6,4) ]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we need to remove the last element (the tail). So new body is [ (6,3) ].

So the snake's head is now at (5,3), and its only body segment is at (6,3).

Wait, but that would mean the snake is in a loop? Because from (5,3), moving to (6,3) again would cause collision. But perhaps not yet.

Now, let me consider the next move.

Current head: (5,3)
Body: [(6,3)]
Apple at (1,4)

So now, current direction is LEFT after the first move. Next possible moves can't be RIGHT because that's opposite to current direction of LEFT? Wait no—current direction is now LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT.

Wait, the movement rule says you can't reverse direction immediately. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

So from (5,3), we can choose directions DOWN or UP, but not RIGHT.

But our target is to get leftwards and up a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to change direction after the first move.

Wait, let me think: After moving LEFT to (5,3), next possible moves are DOWN or UP. Because if current direction is LEFT, you can't go RIGHT next.

So from (5,3), options are:

- DOWN to (5,2)
- UP to (5,4)

But we need to get towards (1,4). So moving up seems more helpful in the y-direction.

Let me see: If I move UP to (5,4):

Check collision: The body is [(6,3)]. (5,4) isn't part of that, so safe.

Update body:

Insert old head (5,3) at front → [ (5,3), (6,3) ]

Since new_head (5,4) != apple, remove tail → [ (5,3) ]

So now, the snake's head is at (5,4), body at (5,3).

That seems better. Now, from here, next possible moves: current direction is UP, so can't go DOWN.

Options are LEFT or RIGHT.

But since we need to move left towards x=1, it's better to choose LEFT again.

So third move: LEFT to (4,4)

Check collision: body is [(5,3)]. New head (4,4) not in body → safe.

Update body:

Insert old head (5,4) at front → [ (5,4), (5,3) ]

Remove tail since no growth → [ (5,4) ]

Now, head at (4,4), body at (5,4).

Current direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.

So next move options: DOWN or UP.

But we need to get towards the apple's y-coordinate of 4, so perhaps continue moving left.

Wait, but y is already at 4. So we just need to keep moving left until x=1.

Let me think: From (4,4), current direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.

So next move options are DOWN or UP. But since y is already 4, which matches the apple's y, perhaps it's better to change direction upwards if needed, but in this case, we're already at y=4.

Wait no—the apple is at (1,4), so same y-coordinate as current head. So moving left towards x=1 would be optimal.

But current direction is LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT. But from (4,4), if I choose to move DOWN or UP, but that might take me away from the target's y-coordinate.

Wait, perhaps better to change direction after the third move.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of path.

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of moving LEFT then UP, we can find a more efficient path.

Wait, let's see:

After first move: (5,3), body [(6,3)]

Second move: maybe not UP but something else? Wait, no—because from (5,3), current direction is LEFT, so next moves can't be RIGHT. So options are DOWN or UP.

If I choose to go UP to (5,4), then proceed leftwards as above.

Alternatively, perhaps a different sequence of moves would allow the snake to reach the apple in fewer steps without collision.

Wait, but given the constraints on direction changes, it's limited.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving LEFT once to (5,3), change direction to UP, and then proceed.

Let me map this out step by step:

Move 1: LEFT from (6,3) → (5,3). Body becomes [(6,3)].

Move 2: UP from (5,3) → (5,4). Body becomes [(5,3)]. Now direction is UP.

Move 3: can't go DOWN now. So options are LEFT or RIGHT. Choose LEFT to move towards x=1.

So move 3: LEFT from (5,4) → (4,4). Body becomes [ (5,4) ].

Move 4: current direction is LEFT; can't go RIGHT. Options are UP or DOWN, but y is already at 4.

Hmm, perhaps better to change direction after moving up once.

Wait, no—because from (5,4), after move 2, the direction is UP, so next moves can't be DOWN. So options for move 3 are LEFT or RIGHT.

If I choose LEFT again: (4,4). Then for move 4, current direction is LEFT; can't go RIGHT. Options are UP or DOWN.

But y is at 4, same as apple's y, so perhaps moving further left.

Move 4: LEFT to (3,4). Body becomes [ (4,4) ].

Move 5: LEFT to (2,4). Body becomes [ (3,4) ].

Move 6: LEFT to (1,4), which is the apple's position. So that would be move 7? Wait no:

Wait, from (6,3):

Move 1: LEFT → (5,3)
Move 2: UP → (5,4)
Move 3: LEFT → (4,4)
Move 4: LEFT → (3,4)
Move 5: LEFT → (2,4)
Move 6: LEFT → (1,4)

So that's six moves in total. But let me check for each step if there are collisions.

After move 1:

Head at (5,3), body [(6,3)].

Move 2: UP to (5,4). Body after inserting old head (5,3) becomes [ (5,3), (6,3) ], then remove tail since no apple eaten. So body is [ (5,3) ].

Now, move 3: LEFT to (4,4).

Check collision: body is [ (5,3) ]; new head (4,4) not in body → safe.

Body after inserting old head (4,4) becomes [ (4,4), (5,3) ], then remove tail since no apple. So body is [ (4,4) ]? Wait no:

Wait, initial body after move 2: [ (5,3) ]

When moving from (5,4) to (4,4):

Insert old head (5,4) → new body list is [ (5,4), (5,3) ]

Then, since new_head is (4,4) and apple not eaten, remove tail → [ (5,4) ].

Wait no—wait, after inserting the old head, the body becomes [ (5,4) ], because before that, the body was [ (5,3) ]. So wait:

After move 2: head is (5,4), body is [ (5,3) ]

When moving to (4,4):

Insert old head (5,4) at front → [ (5,4), (5,3) ]

Then remove tail because no apple eaten → new body list is [ (5,4) ].

So now, the snake's head is at (4,4), and the body is at (5,4).

Wait, that seems like a problem. Because the body is at (5,4), which is adjacent to the new head (4,4). So no collision yet.

Proceeding:

Move 3: LEFT → (4,4) with body [ (5,4) ]

Now, move 4: current direction is LEFT; can't go RIGHT. So next moves can be UP or DOWN. But y=4 is where the apple is, so perhaps better to continue left.

But wait, moving further left from (4,4):

Move 4: LEFT → (3,4). Check collision: body is [ (5,4) ] → new head (3,4) not in body → safe.

Update body:

Insert old head (4,4) → [ (4,4), (5,4) ]

Remove tail since no apple eaten → [ (4,4) ].

Now, move 5: LEFT → (2,4). Body after inserting old head (3,4): [ (3,4), (4,4) ], remove tail → [ (3,4) ]

Move 6: LEFT → (1,4). Now, new_head is at apple's position. So eat the apple.

So in this case, when we reach (1,4), the snake would have eaten the apple, so it grows by not removing the tail.

Wait, let me check:

When moving to (1,4):

Compute new_head: from (2,4) move LEFT → (1,4).

Check collision: body is [ (3,4) ]. So new head is at (1,4), which isn't in body.

Then, update body:

Insert old head (2,4) at front → [ (2,4), (3,4) ]

Since new_head == apple's position, we don't remove the tail. So body becomes [ (2,4), (3,4) ].

So now, the snake's length is 3: head at (1,4), body at (2,4), and tail at (3,4).

Wait, no—the initial insertion adds the old head to the front, making it [ (2,4), (3,4) ], but since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So the body remains as is.

So yes, that's how it would proceed.

But wait, in this scenario, after move 6, the snake has reached the apple. But depending on the rules, does the game end here or can it continue? In this case, assuming the goal is to reach the apple, so once the head is at (1,4), we're done.

So that's six moves:

1. LEFT
2. UP
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. LEFT
6. LEFT

Wait no—the move sequence I described had 6 steps, but each step corresponds to a direction change, not necessarily the count of moves. Let me recount:

Starting at (6,3):

Move 1: LEFT → (5,3) [direction now LEFT]

Move 2: UP → (5,4) [direction now UP]

Move 3: LEFT → (4,4) [direction now LEFT]

Move 4: LEFT → (3,4)

Move 5: LEFT → (2,4)

Move 6: LEFT → (1,4)

So yes, six moves. But in some cases, moving up first might help reach the apple faster.

Alternatively, perhaps a different path could reach it in fewer steps.

Wait, let's see:

Alternative approach:

From (6,3):

Move 1: UP to (6,4) [direction now UP]

But can't do that because from (6,3), initial direction is undefined? Wait no—the first move can be any direction except for the opposite of some previous direction. But since it's the first move, you can choose any.

Wait, actually, in the initial state, the snake is at (6,3) facing a certain direction. Let me clarify:

Assuming the snake starts facing LEFT, as per standard setup, but perhaps not necessarily. However, for the sake of this problem, let's assume that the first move can be any direction.

But to simplify, in the initial approach, we chose LEFT, but maybe choosing UP first is better.

Let me try:

Move 1: UP → (6,4)

Body after inserting old head (6,3) becomes [ (6,3) ]

Now, move 2: can't go DOWN (since direction is UP). So options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Choose LEFT to start moving towards x=1.

Move 2: LEFT → (5,4) [direction now LEFT]

Body after inserting old head (6,4): [ (6,4), (6,3) ] then remove tail since no apple eaten. So body is [ (6,4) ]

Move 3: current direction LEFT; can't go RIGHT.

Options: DOWN or UP.

But y=4 is the target, so better to continue left.

Wait, but y is already at 4. So moving left.

Move 3: LEFT → (4,4). Body after inserting old head (5,4): [ (5,4), (6,4) ] remove tail → [ (5,4) ]

Move 4: LEFT → (3,4). Body becomes [ (4,4) ]

Move 5: LEFT → (2,4). Body becomes [ (3,4) ]

Move 6: LEFT → (1,4). Success.

Same number of steps. So no improvement.

Alternatively, maybe using a different path by going DOWN first.

From (6,3):

Move 1: DOWN → (6,2)

Body after inserting old head (6,3): [ (6,3) ]

Move 2: can't go UP now. Options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Choose LEFT to move towards x=1.

Move 2: LEFT → (5,2). Body becomes [ (6,2) ] after removing tail.

Move 3: current direction LEFT; options are DOWN or UP. But y is at 2, which is below target's y=4. So perhaps better to go UP.

But moving UP from (5,2):

Move 3: UP → (5,3). Check if collision with body [ (6,2) ] → no.

Body after inserting old head (5,2): [ (5,2), (6,2) ] then remove tail → [ (5,2) ]

Now, move 4: current direction is UP; can't go DOWN. Options are LEFT or RIGHT. Choose LEFT to proceed towards x=1.

Move 4: LEFT → (4,3). Body after inserting old head (5,3): [ (5,3), (5,2) ] remove tail → [ (5,3) ]

Move 5: LEFT → (3,3). Body becomes [ (4,3) ]

But this seems to be taking us away from the target y=4.

Alternatively, after move 3 at (5,3), change direction to UP again? But wait, current direction is UP, so can't go DOWN. So options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Hmm, perhaps this path isn't better.

Therefore, it seems that moving in a straight line towards the apple's y-coordinate and then proceeding left is the most efficient way, requiring six moves: three to adjust position (UP and necessary LEFTs) and then three more LEFTs to reach x=1.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as:

The minimal number of steps required to reach from (6,3) to (1,4). Since the snake can only move one step at a time in four directions, and can't reverse direction immediately after each move, what's the shortest path.

But since movement is grid-based and no obstacles, except for the body which can't collide with itself. But since we're trying to reach (1,4), perhaps the optimal path doesn't require any collision checks beyond the immediate step.

Wait, but in this problem, the snake grows by not removing the tail when it eats the apple. So if the snake hasn't eaten the apple yet, after each move, the tail is removed unless the head is on food.

Therefore, to reach (1,4), we need a path that doesn't require moving into any part of the body except possibly at the end when eating the apple.

Given that, perhaps the minimal steps are as follows:

From (6,3):

1. Move LEFT to (5,3)
2. Move UP to (5,4)
3. Move LEFT to (4,4)
4. Move LEFT to (3,4)
5. Move LEFT to (2,4)
6. Move LEFT to (1,4)

So six moves in total.

Therefore, the answer is that it takes six moves for the snake to reach the apple at position (1,4).
</think>

The snake starts at position (6,3) and needs to reach the apple at (1,4). By moving left three times to align horizontally with the apple's x-coordinate and then up once, followed by two more left moves, the snake successfully reaches the apple in six steps. Thus, the minimal number of moves required is six.

$\boxed{6}$
