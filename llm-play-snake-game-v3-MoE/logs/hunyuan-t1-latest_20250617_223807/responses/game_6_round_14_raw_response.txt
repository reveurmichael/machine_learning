{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 3 units up (from y=3 to y=6) and 3 units right (from x=2 to x=5) to reach the apple at (5,6). Starting with the current direction 'RIGHT', the first valid moves are 'UP' to avoid immediate body collisions. Moving up three times positions the head at (2,6), then moving right three times reaches the apple. Each step avoids body segments, and after eating the apple, there are legal moves available (e.g., UP, DOWN, RIGHT).",
