========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is currently at (5,5) with no body segments, so it's just the head and nothing else. The apple is at (5,8), which is three units up from the head.

First, I need to figure out how to get from (5,5) to (5,8). Since the snake has no body right now, it can move directly towards the apple without worrying about collisions with its own body. The goal is to move upwards because the y-coordinate needs to increase by 3.

The movement rules say that on each turn, if the new head position doesn't collide and is within bounds, the snake moves. Since the initial direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed. So I can start moving up.

Let's plan the moves:
1. First move: UP to (5,6)
2. Second move: UP to (5,7)
3. Third move: UP to (5,8), which is where the apple is.

Now, each of these moves needs to be checked for collisions. Since there are no body segments initially, moving up three times should be safe. Once the snake reaches the apple, it will grow by one segment because the body doesn't get removed when eating.

However, after eating, I need to ensure that at least one legal move remains for the next turn. If the snake is now two units long (head + one body), moving upwards again might cause a collision with the new body segment. So, I should avoid moving up once more and instead look for alternative directions, but since the problem only asks for the moves to reach the apple, I don't need to plan beyond that.

So the safe path is three UP moves.

  "moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,5) with no body segments and needs to move up three times to reach the apple at (5,8). Each move is safe as there are no collisions possible."
