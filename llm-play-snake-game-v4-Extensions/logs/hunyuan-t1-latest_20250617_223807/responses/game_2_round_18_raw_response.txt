{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move up 6 times and left once to reach the apple at (1,8). Starting from (2,2) with direction LEFT, moving UP avoids immediate body collisions and navigates toward the apple's y-coordinate. After reaching (2,8), a final LEFT move reaches the apple. Each step checks for safe positions, and after eating the apple, there are legal moves available."
