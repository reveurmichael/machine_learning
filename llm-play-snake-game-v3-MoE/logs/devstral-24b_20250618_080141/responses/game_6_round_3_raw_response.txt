========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the game state to determine a safe path for the snake from its current position `(9,5)` to the apple at `(3,4)`.

## Current Game State:
- **Head Position**: `(9, 5)`
- **Current Direction**: `"DOWN"`
- **Body Cells**: `[(9, 6), (8, 6)]` — So full snake is: `[HEAD(9,5), BODY1(9,6), BODY2(8,6)]`
- **Apple Position**: `(3, 4)`

## Path Analysis:
1. **Initial Direction Constraints**:
   - Current direction is "DOWN", so the first move cannot be "UP".
   - Valid directions from (9,5): "LEFT" or "RIGHT".

2. **Target Offset Calculation**:
   - From (9,5) to (3,4):
     - Need 6 moves LEFT (from x=9 to x=3)
     - Need 1 move DOWN (from y=5 to y=4)

3. **Path Planning with Safety Checks**:
   - Plan needs to avoid collisions.
   - Must ensure there is at least one legal move after eating the apple.

## Move Calculation:
Let's plan the moves while ensuring continuity and avoiding immediate self-collision:

1. Move LEFT (to stay safe within bounds and avoid the body)
2. Continue moving LEFT until close to the apple
3. Then, make necessary vertical adjustments with DOWN

### Proposed Path: `["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT"]`

This path will get us from `(9,5)` → `(8,5)` → `(7,5)` → `(6,5)` → `(6,4)` → `(5,4)` → `(4,4)`, which is safe and avoids collisions.

## Output JSON:
```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Planned a path that moves LEFT to approach the apple while avoiding collisions. Ensured there are legal moves remaining after eating."
}
```

This should be our final output as it respects all game rules and ensures safe movement towards the apple.
