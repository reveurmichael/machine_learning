========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
  "moves": ["UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake is currently at (3,5) and needs to reach the apple at (3,6). Since both coordinates have the same x-value, we need a vertical move. The current direction is RIGHT, so we can't reverse immediately. Moving UP is safe as it's within bounds, doesn't collide with any body part, and gets us closer to the apple."
