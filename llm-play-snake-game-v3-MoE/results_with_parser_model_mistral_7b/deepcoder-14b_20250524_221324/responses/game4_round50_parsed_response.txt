{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"], "reasoning": "The snake can move one unit at a time in any of the four cardinal directions: up, down, left, and right.

Moving UP once puts us at (0, 8), then moving RIGHT six times leads to (6, 8) without colliding with the snake's body."}
