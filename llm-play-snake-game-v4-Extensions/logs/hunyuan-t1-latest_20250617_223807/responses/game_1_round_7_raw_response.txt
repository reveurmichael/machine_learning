{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (1,1) with a vertical body along x=1. To reach the apple at (3,9), the snake needs to move 2 units right and 8 units up. First, move RIGHT twice to shift the head to (3,1) while the body adjusts. Then, move UP 8 times to align the head with the apple. Each UP move is safe as the body follows without collision, and after eating the apple, there are valid lateral moves to avoid trapping."
