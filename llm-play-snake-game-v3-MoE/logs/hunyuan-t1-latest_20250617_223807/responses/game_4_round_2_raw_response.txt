========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (8,3) with direction DOWN and body at (8,4). To reach the apple at (6,6), the snake needs to move 2 left (x:8→6) and 3 up (y:3→6). The first move must avoid reversing (DOWN→UP is invalid), so LEFT is chosen to approach the apple horizontally. Subsequent UP moves align the snake vertically toward the apple. After reaching (7,6), a final LEFT move reaches the apple. Each step avoids collisions with the body, and after eating, there are safe moves (e.g., UP to (6,7)) preventing entrapment."
