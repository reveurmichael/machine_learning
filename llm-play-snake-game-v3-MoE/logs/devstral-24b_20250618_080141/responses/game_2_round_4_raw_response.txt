========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'm currently unable to execute Python code directly due to technical limitations. However, I can help you write a Python script that will analyze the game state and generate the required JSON output according to your specifications.

Here's a sample script that you can use:

```python
import json

def is_valid_move(head_x, head_y, direction, body):
    new_head = get_new_head_position(head_x, head_y, direction)
    if not (0 <= new_head[0] < 10 and 0 <= new_head[1] < 10):
        return False
    if new_head in body:
        return False
    return True

def get_new_head_position(head_x, head_y, direction):
    directions = {
        "UP": (0, 1),
        "DOWN": (0, -1),
        "LEFT": (-1, 0),
        "RIGHT": (1, 0)
    }
    dx, dy = directions[direction]
    return head_x + dx, head_y + dy

def find_safe_path(head_pos, direction, body, apple_pos):
    head_x, head_y = head_pos
    apple_x, apple_y = apple_pos
    if head_pos == apple_pos:
        return []

    moves = []
    while (head_x, head_y) != apple_pos:
        for dir in ["UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"]:
            if is_valid_move(head_x, head_y, dir, body):
                new_head = get_new_head_position(head_x, head_y, dir)
                moves.append(dir)
                head_x, head_y = new_head
                break
        else:
            return {"moves": moves, "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND"}

    return {"moves": moves, "reasoning": "Safe path found to apple."}

# Inputs
head_position = (3, 8)
current_direction = "UP"
body_cells = [(3, 7), (4, 7)]
apple_position = (0, 8)

result = find_safe_path(head_position, current_direction, body_cells, apple_position)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

This script defines functions to check valid moves and get new head positions. It then tries to find a safe path from the snake's head to the apple position using these helper functions. If it can't find a path, it returns an empty moves list with "NO_PATH_FOUND" as reasoning. Otherwise, it returns the sequence of moves.

You can run this script in your Python environment to get the desired JSON output.
