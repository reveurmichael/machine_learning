========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake eat the apple at (6,2) without dying. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's look at the current state of the game. The snake's head is at (7,7), which is near the top-right corner. The body cells are [(9,7), (8,7)], so the snake is moving in a way that those two squares are behind the head. The direction is LEFT, meaning the head was previously moving to the left.

The apple is located at (6,2). So from the head's current position, we need to figure out how to get there without colliding with the body or going outside the grid. Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so we have to make sure that there's still a way for the snake to move without getting stuck.

Let me visualize the grid. The head is at (7,7), which is in the top row. To get to (6,2), the snake needs to move left once and then down five times. But wait, actually, the x-coordinate decreases from 7 to 6 (so one LEFT move) and the y-coordinate goes from 7 to 2, which is a decrease of 5, so that would be five DOWN moves.

But the snake is currently moving LEFT, so if I change direction now, I have to make sure it's not reversing. Reversing here would mean going RIGHT, which isn't allowed since the current direction is LEFT. So from LEFT, possible next directions are UP or DOWN or continue LEFT. Wait, no—the movement rules say that you can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT. So the possible moves after being in LEFT are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

Wait, let me double-check: the movement rules state that the snake cannot reverse direction. So for example, if it's going UP, it can't go DOWN next. So in this case, since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can be LEFT (continue moving left), UP (turn up from left), or DOWN (turn down from left). It can't go RIGHT because that would reverse the direction.

So starting at (7,7) moving LEFT, the body cells are [(9,7), (8,7)], which means those squares are behind. So if I move LEFT again, the head will be at (6,7). But wait, let me think about how the body updates each step.

Each time the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten. In this case, since the apple hasn't been eaten yet, when moving, the tail will shrink. So initially, after moving, the body cells shift.

Wait, no—the body list given is [(9,7), (8,7)], which are two segments behind the head at (7,7). That suggests that the snake's current length is 3: head at (7,7) and two body parts. So when moving, if the apple isn't eaten, the tail will be removed.

But since we're going towards the apple, perhaps we'll eat it on one of the steps, which would prevent the tail from shrinking that turn.

So let's plan a path:

From (7,7), direction is LEFT. Possible next moves: LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

If I move LEFT to (6,7). Then, check if this new head position collides with any body parts. The body after moving would be [(8,7), (9,7)]? Wait no—when the snake moves, the head becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, let's clarify: when you move, the new head is added, and the tail is removed if no apple was eaten. So after moving LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7), the body cells become [(9,7), (8,7), (6,7)]? No, wait—no. Because the snake's body moves by shifting each segment towards the head.

Wait, actually, when the snake moves, each body part follows the previous one. So if the head is at (7,7) and direction is LEFT, moving to (6,7), then the next segments would be [(9,7), (8,7)] but now, after moving, the new head is (6,7), so the body becomes [(7,7), (9,7), (8,7)], no? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each step:

Current state:
- Head: (7,7)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body cells: [(9,7), (8,7)]

So the snake is in a straight line moving LEFT. So from (7,7) to (6,7), but wait no—because direction is LEFT, so each step moves x by -1.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the snake as being composed of segments that follow the head. So when moving LEFT, the head goes to (6,7). Then, the body parts [(9,7), (8,7)] would each move to their next positions: 9,7 becomes 8,7; 8,7 becomes 7,7. But since we're adding a new head at (6,7), the body now is [9,7 -> 8,7 ->7,7], but wait no—the tail would be removed unless an apple was eaten.

Wait, maybe I should model each step:

1. Start: Head at (7,7), direction LEFT, body [(9,7), (8,7)].
2. Move LEFT:
   - New head is (6,7).
   - Body segments move forward: the first body part (9,7) moves to 8,7; second (8,7) moves to 7,7.
   - Since no apple was eaten yet, the tail (the last segment, which is the oldest one, perhaps 9,7?) Wait no—when you move, each segment follows the previous. So after moving, the body becomes [(6,7), 9,7 ->8,7; 8,7->7,7]. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that when moving, all body parts shift towards the head, and the tail is removed if no apple was eaten. So after moving:

- New head: (6,7)
- Body becomes [9,7 →8,7; 8,7→7,7]. But since we didn't eat an apple yet, the tail (the last segment) is removed. Wait, but the body list given is two segments—so after moving, if not eating, it would be three segments: head at (6,7), then (7,7), and (8,7). Because each move adds a new head and removes the tail unless apple is eaten.

Wait no—the initial state has the head as (7,7) and body cells [(9,7), (8,7)]. So when moving LEFT to (6,7):

- The new head is (6,7).
- The previous head (7,7) becomes part of the body.
- The first body cell (9,7) moves to 8,7.
- The second body cell (8,7) moves to 7,7.

But since no apple was eaten in this move, the tail is removed. So which one is the tail? In the initial state, the body cells are [(9,7), (8,7)], so perhaps they're ordered from oldest to newest. So when moving LEFT:

- New head: (6,7)
- Body parts after movement would be [ (7,7), (8,7) ]

Because 9,7 moves to 8,7; 8,7 moves to 7,7.

Wait no—maybe I should think that the body cells are in order from the last segment to the one before the head. So [(9,7), (8,7)] would mean that after the head at (7,7), the next part is (8,7), then (9,7). But when moving LEFT, each part follows the previous.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

The initial position: Head at (7,7), body cells [(9,7), (8,7)]. So the snake is arranged as (9,7) → (8,7) → (7,7). So it's moving to the left, with each segment following the previous. Now, when the head moves LEFT to (6,7):

- The new body will be [(8,7), (9,7)]? Or wait—no, because each segment moves into the position of the next one.

Wait, perhaps the movement works as follows: Each segment in the body list is a cell that was previously occupied by the snake. So when moving, the head moves to a new position, and each body part takes the place of the previous one.

So initial state:

Head: (7,7)

Body: [ (9,7), (8,7) ]

After moving LEFT:

New Head: (6,7)

Each body part moves towards where the head was. So (9,7) becomes 8,7; (8,7) becomes 7,7.

But since we haven't eaten an apple yet, the tail is removed. The original tail was at (8,7). After moving, it's now at (7,7), so the body becomes [8,7]?

Wait no—this isn't clear. Maybe I should look for a pattern or example.

Alternatively, perhaps each move adds the new head position to the body list and then drops the oldest cell unless an apple was eaten.

So initial state:

Body: [ (9,7), (8,7) ]

When moving LEFT, new head is (6,7). So the body becomes [(8,7), (9,7), (6,7)]? But that doesn't make sense because the snake can't have a loop.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each step as:

- The new head position is added.
- All existing body parts shift towards the head by one.
- If no apple was eaten, remove the last part (the tail).

So in this case, moving from (7,7) LEFT to (6,7):

New head: (6,7)

Body becomes [ (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) ]? No, that would reverse the direction.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of it as a queue:

- The head is at the front.
- Each body cell follows in order.

So when moving LEFT, each part follows the one before it.

Initial state: Head (7,7), body [(9,7), (8,7)] → so the snake is 3 units long, with the tail at (9,7).

After moving LEFT:

Head moves to (6,7)

Each body part moves forward:

- The first body cell (9,7) would move to 8,7
- The second body cell (8,7) would move to 7,7

But since no apple was eaten, the tail (9,7) is removed. So the new body cells are [(8,7), (7,7)].

So now, after moving LEFT:

Head: (6,7)

Body: [ (8,7), (7,7) ]

Wait, that seems okay because (6,7) is the head, and then 8,7 and 7,7 are behind. But wait, 8,7 is to the right of the head? That would mean the snake's body is going from (6,7) → (7,7) → (8,7), which is opposite direction.

Wait, that can't be right because the snake was moving LEFT before. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body moves.

Alternatively, perhaps when you move, each body segment follows the movement of the previous one. So if the head is at (7,7) and moves to (6,7), then each subsequent body part also moves in that direction.

But given that the body cells are [(9,7), (8,7)], which suggests they were added when moving LEFT, meaning from 7,7 → 8,7 →9,7. Wait no—that would mean that the snake was growing towards increasing x, but the direction is LEFT.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach: perhaps it's better to plan the path step by step, ensuring that each move doesn't cause collision with body or walls.

The goal is to get from (7,7) to (6,2). So let's see:

- The x-coordinate needs to decrease by 1 (from 7 to 6).
- The y-coordinate needs to decrease by 5 (from 7 to 2).

So the snake needs to make one LEFT move and five DOWN moves.

But considering that movement can't reverse direction, and the initial direction is LEFT. So possible moves from each position have to follow the rules.

Let me consider the initial state:

Head: (7,7), Direction: LEFT

Possible next moves: LEFT, UP, or DOWN (can't go RIGHT).

Option 1: Move LEFT to (6,7). Then, check if that's safe. The body after moving would be [(8,7), (9,7)] but wait no—after moving LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7):

- New head is (6,7)
- The previous head (7,7) becomes the next body part.
- Then, each body cell moves towards the new head.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the snake as a list of coordinates. So initial snake: [ (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) ]

So the head is first element, then the body parts follow in order.

When moving LEFT:

- New head is (6,7)
- Each subsequent part moves to where the previous one was.

So new snake becomes [ (6,7), (7,7), (8,7) ]

But since no apple was eaten, we remove the last part: so the body becomes [ (7,7), (8,7) ]? Or is it that the tail is removed?

Wait, according to the rules:

- When an apple isn't eaten, the tail is removed after moving.

So in this case, initial snake length is 3. After moving LEFT and not eating an apple, the tail (9,7) would be removed, making the snake [ (6,7), (7,7), (8,7) ]? No, because it's a queue: when you move, you add the new head and remove the last element unless you eat an apple.

So initial list is [ (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) ]

After moving LEFT:

- New head is (6,7)
- List becomes [ (6,7), (7,7), (8,7) ]
- Then, since no apple was eaten, remove the last element: [ (6,7), (7,7) ]

So now, after moving LEFT, snake is [ (6,7), (7,7) ].

Is this position safe? Let's see.

The head is at (6,7). The body is at (7,7). So no collision. Good.

Next, from (6,7), what can we do?

Direction is now LEFT again because the last move was LEFT.

Wait no—the direction remains unless changed with a UP or DOWN move.

Wait, in this problem, when you make a move (LEFT, RIGHT, etc.), that becomes your new direction. So moving LEFT once will set the direction to LEFT; then, subsequent moves can be in any allowed direction, as long as they don't reverse.

Wait no—the movement rules only prevent reversal of direction. For example, if you're going LEFT, you can move LEFT again (straight), but not RIGHT (which would reverse). But wait, is that the case?

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement. It says:

"You cannot make a U-turn; in other words, you cannot reverse the direction."

So from LEFT, you can go LEFT or DOWN or UP, but not RIGHT.

So moving left again would be allowed.

But then, how do you change direction? You have to make a turn, like UP or DOWN, which changes direction without reversing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

In any case, after the first move:

Snake is at [ (6,7), (7,7) ]

Next, from (6,7), what can we do?

We were moving LEFT last time. So we can't go RIGHT now; but can go LEFT again, or UP or DOWN.

Option: Move DOWN to (6,6).

Is that safe? Let's see:

After moving DOWN:

New head is (6,6)

Body part becomes [ (7,7) ]

Wait no—snake was [ (6,7), (7,7) ]

Moving DOWN would make the new head (6,6). The previous head (6,7) moves to the body. So snake becomes [ (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ]? No, wait:

Wait, each move adds a new head and shifts all existing parts.

So initial state: [ (6,7), (7,7) ]

After moving DOWN:

- New head is (6,6)
- Previous head (6,7) becomes part of the body.
- So snake becomes [ (6,6), (6,7) ]

And since no apple was eaten, we remove the last part? Wait, initial length after first move was 2. After moving again, would it be 3?

Wait, perhaps each move adds a new head and keeps all existing parts until an apple is eaten.

But according to the problem statement:

"Each time you make a movement (left, right, up, down), your snake grows by one unit."

So each move increases the length of the snake unless it's moving into its own body.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The snake grows by one each time you move, regardless of direction.

But in that case, the initial state after first move would be:

Snake: [ (6,7), (7,7) ]

After second move DOWN to (6,6):

Snake becomes [ (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ]

Which is length 3 again. But this can't be right because without eating an apple, the snake shouldn't grow.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me re-read the problem statement:

"Each time you make a movement (left, right, up, down), your snake grows by one unit."

So every move increases the length of the snake by one, regardless of whether it's eaten an apple. So in this case:

- Initial position: head at (7,7). Body is two segments [(9,7), (8,7)]. Wait no—the body cells are given as [ (9,7), (8,7) ], so the snake is 3 units long: head + two body parts.

So length is 3. After moving LEFT:

- Snake becomes 4 units? Or does it only grow when eating an apple?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting information.

The problem statement says: "Each time you make a movement (left, right, up, down), your snake grows by one unit."

So every move makes the snake longer by one. So initial length is 3. After first move, it's 4. After second move, 5, etc.

But that would cause the snake to grow indefinitely unless some mechanism trims it—probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps "snake grows by one unit" refers only when eating an apple. But according to the problem statement, it says each movement makes it grow.

Wait, let's check again:

The user message is: "Each time you make a movement (left, right, up, down), your snake grows by one unit."

So yes, every move increases the length of the snake.

But then, in the initial state, the body cells are two segments; moving would add another segment each time.

Wait no—the user message says that body is given as [ (9,7), (8,7) ], so the head is at (7,7). So the initial length is 3: head + two body parts. Each movement adds a new head and shifts the existing ones, but does not remove anything unless you hit your own body.

Wait no—if each movement makes the snake grow by one unit, then it's always getting longer, which would make collision detection more important to avoid self-collision.

But that seems problematic because the snake can't survive forever. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, and "grows by one" only when eating an apple.

Alternatively, maybe the growth is only in addition to normal movement—i.e., each move adds a new segment at the head, but the tail remains unless you grow due to eating.

Wait, this is unclear, which makes it difficult to model.

Given that, perhaps I should proceed with planning the path assuming that the snake grows by one unit each time, meaning it can't reverse into itself because its body is getting longer.

So back to the initial problem: plan a path from (7,7) to (6,2), making sure that each move doesn't cause collision with existing body parts and adheres to movement rules.

Let me try step by step:

1. Start at (7,7). Direction: LEFT. Body: [ (9,7), (8,7) ]

Possible moves from here: LEFT, UP, DOWN (can't go RIGHT as it's reversal).

Option 1: Move LEFT to (6,7). New head is (6,7). Since no apple eaten, body becomes [(6,7), (7,7)]? Or wait—each move adds a new segment. So initial body is two segments; moving would add a third.

Wait, I'm confused again. Let me instead model the snake as [head] + [body parts], each movement adding a new head and shifting all body parts forward.

So:

- Initial: [ (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) ]

After moving LEFT:

- New head is (6,7)
- Each body part moves to where the previous head was.
- So snake becomes [ (6,7), (7,7), (8,7) ]
- No apple eaten, so perhaps the tail isn't removed. Wait, but according to problem statement, each movement makes the snake grow by one unit. So it should add a segment.

Wait, no—the initial statement says that when you make a move, your snake grows by one unit. So in this case, after moving, the snake becomes length 4: [ (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) ]? That can't be right because movement would cause overlapping.

I think I'm stuck on how the snake's body updates with each move. Maybe I should try a different approach—since the problem statement gives the initial position and asks for a sequence of moves to reach (6,2), perhaps focusing on that.

The goal is (6,2). So from (7,7) to (6,2), moving one LEFT and five DOWNs.

But considering direction changes:

1. From (7,7), move LEFT to (6,7).

Now, can't go RIGHT because it's reversal.

From (6,7):

Options: LEFT, UP, DOWN.

If we keep going LEFT, but that would take us further away from the target in x-coordinate, as our goal is at x=6. So maybe better to start moving down.

So:

2. From (6,7), move DOWN to (6,6).

Now, direction is DOWN.

3. Move DOWN again: (6,5)

4. DOWN: (6,4)

5. DOWN: (6,3)

6. DOWN: (6,2). Now we're at the target.

But wait—this would require six moves: one LEFT and five DOWNs. Each move increases the length of the snake by one unit.

But we have to make sure that none of these new positions collide with the existing body.

Let me check each step:

Step 1: Move LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7). The body is now [ (6,7), (7,7), (8,7) ]? Or is it longer?

Wait, I'm not sure about how the body grows. Maybe I can ignore that for now and focus on direction.

But perhaps there's a shorter path or one that allows fewer turns.

Alternatively:

1. Move LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7).

2. Now, at (6,7). Change direction DOWN.

3. Move DOWN to (6,6)

4. DOWN to (6,5)

5. DOWN to (6,4)

6. DOWN to (6,3)

7. DOWN to (6,2).

So that's seven moves in total: 1 LEFT and 6 DOWNs.

But each move adds a segment, so the snake grows longer with each step. However, since we're moving straight after the first turn, it shouldn't collide.

Alternatively, could we make some turns earlier?

Wait, perhaps another approach:

1. Move DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6)

2. Then LEFT to (6,6)

3. Then DOWN five times: 6→5→4→3→2

But let's see the steps:

Step 1: From (7,7), can't move RIGHT as it's reversal. So options: LEFT, UP, DOWN.

If we choose DOWN first, then:

After step 1: head at (7,6). Body is [ (7,6), (8,7) ]? Or longer?

I think the exact body path might not matter as much if I keep moving straight after turning once.

But perhaps the initial move should be LEFT to align with the target x-coordinate.

So:

1. Move LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7)

2. From (6,7), move DOWN six times to reach (6,2).

This seems straightforward. Now, check if any of these positions would cause a collision with the body.

After step 1: snake is at (6,7). Body is [ (6,7), (7,7) ]?

Wait, I'm not sure about how the body updates. If each move adds to the front and doesn't remove from the back unless eating an apple, then after first move, snake's head is at (6,7), with previous positions as body.

So:

After step 1: [ (6,7), (7,7) ]

Wait, that seems too short. I think each movement adds a new segment to the front and keeps all existing ones unless it's a self-collision.

But perhaps in this problem, since we're not given any apples, the snake just grows longer with each move.

So after moving LEFT once: body is [ (6,7), (7,7) ]

After moving DOWN once from (6,7): new head at (6,6). So snake becomes [ (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) ]?

Wait, but that would require the snake to have three segments. But initially, it's two body segments plus the head.

I think I'm overcomplicating; maybe the key is just to provide a sequence of moves that leads from (7,7) to (6,2), ensuring direction changes don't reverse and that path doesn't cross itself.

The simplest way would be:

1. LEFT

2. DOWN x6

So total moves: 7.

Thus, the sequence is: LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

But in terms of directions: first move LEFT, then six moves DOWN.

Yes, that seems to work.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at (7, 7) to the target position at (6, 2). The snake can only make movements in four directions: left, right, up, and down. Importantly, the snake cannot reverse direction; it cannot move directly back onto itself.

### Approach
1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at (7, 7) with its body segments extending to (8, 7) and (9, 7). This means the snake is initially aligned to the right.
2. **First Move**: To align the snake towards the target position in the x-direction, we move left from (7, 7) to (6, 7).
3. **Subsequent Moves**: After moving left, the snake needs to move down repeatedly to reach the target y-coordinate of 2. Each move down will incrementally decrease the y-value until it reaches 2.

This approach ensures that we do not reverse direction and efficiently navigate the snake towards the target position by first adjusting its x-coordinate and then its y-coordinate.

### Solution Code
```python
# The sequence of moves to reach (6, 2) from (7, 7)
moves = ['LEFT', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN']
```

### Explanation
- **Step 1**: Move left from (7, 7) to (6, 7). This changes the snake's direction and positions it correctly in the x-axis.
- **Steps 2-7**: Continue moving down six times. Each move decreases the y-coordinate by 1 until the target (6, 2) is reached.

This sequence of moves ensures that the snake does not reverse direction and efficiently navigates to the target position without colliding with itself.
