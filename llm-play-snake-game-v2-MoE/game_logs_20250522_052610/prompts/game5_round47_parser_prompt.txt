<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the snake can safely move from its current position at (1,1) to eat the apple at (3,6). Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the current state. The head is at (1,1), and the body cells are [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. So the snake is currently in a vertical line along x=1, stretching from y=2 up to y=7. The apple is at (3,6).

The direction of movement right now is "DOWN", but since the first move cannot reverse direction, I can't immediately go UP if that's needed. Wait, no—the current direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP because that would reverse direction. So from DOWN, possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But looking at the body cells, moving DOWN from (1,1) would take it to (1,0), which is outside the grid since y=0 is allowed but wait—the grid is 0 ≤ x <10 and 0 ≤ y <10. So y can be 0, so (1,0) is valid. However, moving DOWN from head at (1,1) would take it to (1,0), but the body cells include (1,2), (1,3), etc., so if the snake moves DOWN, the new head would be at (1,0), and then the tail would either stay or shrink. But since we have an apple elsewhere, maybe moving towards it is better.

But wait, the apple is at (3,6). So from (1,1), I need to move right twice in x (to 3) and up five times in y (from 1 to 6). So overall, net moves: RIGHT *2, UP*5. But the snake's current direction is DOWN, so if it continues moving DOWN, that might not be efficient.

Wait, but let me think about possible paths without hitting the body or walls. The snake's body is along x=1 from y=2 to y=7. So any move towards x=3 would require moving right, but I need to ensure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with its own body.

Let me visualize the grid:

- Current head: (1,1)
- Body cells: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]
So the snake is a vertical line from (1,2) up to (1,7). The tail is at (1,2), but when the head moves, the body follows.

If I move RIGHT first, that would take the head to (2,1). But then I have to check if this new position is safe. Since the body cells are along x=1, moving right doesn't immediately cause collision because (2,1) isn't part of the body. However, after each move, the body segments shift.

Wait, but when the snake moves, the head becomes a new body cell, and the tail either stays or is removed unless an apple is eaten. So if I move RIGHT to (2,1), then the body cells would become [(2,1), (1,7), ... , (1,3)], but wait no—the body cells are the previous positions excluding head. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first move DOWN to get away from the body and then start moving RIGHT and UP. But let me check.

Wait, current direction is DOWN, so next move cannot be UP because that would reverse direction. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If I move DOWN to (1,0), which is allowed, but then after that, the body cells will shift: the new head is at (1,0), and the previous head (1,1) becomes part of the body. The next positions would be (1,7), etc., so the body now includes (1,1). So if I move DOWN again to (1,-1), that's invalid because y can't be negative.

Wait no—since we're on a 10x10 grid, y ranges from 0 to 9. So moving from (1,1) to (1,0) is allowed, but then the next move cannot go further down because it would take y to -1, which is invalid.

So perhaps moving DOWN first isn't the best idea. Let me consider other options.

Alternatively, I can move RIGHT. From (1,1), moving RIGHT takes me to (2,1). Is this position safe? The body cells are at x=1, so no collision yet. Then, from there, I need to plan a path towards (3,6).

But let's think about the required number of moves. To reach x=3 from 1, I need two RIGHT moves. To reach y=6 from 1, I need five UP moves.

So total moves would be at least 2+5=7 moves if moving directly, but considering possible detours to avoid body collisions, it might take longer.

Wait, the body is along x=1 from y=2 up, so when I move RIGHT, the head is now at (2,1), and after each step, the body follows. So the body cells would shift accordingly.

Let me try to plan a path:

Move 1: RIGHT to (2,1)
Now, new body includes (2,1) as the head, and previous positions from (1,7) down to (1,3). Wait no—the body is given as [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. So when the head moves to (2,1), the body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] plus the new position after each move. Wait no—the body cells are all except the current head. So if I move RIGHT to (2,1), then the body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,1)]. But that's not correct because the body cells are given as the previous positions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the body cells list provided is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)], which are all along x=1, from y=2 to y=7. So when the head moves to (2,1), the new body will be [head becomes (2,1), then previous positions from (1,7) down to (1,2)]. Wait no—the snake's body is a list of segments behind the head. So after moving RIGHT to (2,1), the body cells would become [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,1)], but that can't be right because the length is 7, and the snake was previously 6 segments long. Wait no—the body cells given are excluding the head. So when the head moves to (2,1), the new body is [(2,1)] plus all previous body cells except the last one? Or does it add the new position as the first element.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that after each move, the snake's body follows: the head moves, and each segment takes the place of the previous one. So if the head moves to (2,1), then the next segments would be at (1,1), but wait no—the body cells are [(1,7), (1,6), ..., (1,2)]. Wait, that can't be because the snake's body is in a vertical line from (1,2) up. So when the head moves to (2,1), it's now outside that line.

Wait, maybe I should think of the snake as being a list where each move appends the new head and then shifts all segments forward. But perhaps an alternative approach is better: find a path that doesn't cause any collision with the body after each step.

So starting at (1,1), moving RIGHT to (2,1) seems safe because none of the body cells are at x=2 yet.

After that, I can move UP to (2,2). But wait, let's see:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Now, the body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,1)]. Wait no—the initial body cells are given as [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)], which is six segments. So after moving to (2,1), the new head is at (2,1), and the body becomes the previous list plus (2,1) as the first element? Or does it shift?

I think when the snake moves, each segment follows the one in front of it. So the initial body cells are [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] which is six segments behind the head at (1,1). When the head moves to (2,1), the new body becomes [(2,1), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)], but that doesn't seem right because the snake can't have the segments in a different order.

Alternatively, perhaps when the head moves, each body segment takes the position of the previous one. So after moving RIGHT to (2,1), the new body cells would be [(2,1), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]. But that seems incorrect because the segments should follow in order.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to ensure that after each move, the new head position isn't occupied by any body segment or outside the grid.

So let's proceed step by step:

Current head: (1,1)
Body cells: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]
Apple at (3,6)

Possible moves from (1,1) given current direction is DOWN.

Wait, the movement rules say that if direction is NONE, any move is allowed. But in this case, direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP because it would reverse direction. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But let's see:

If I move DOWN to (1,0), then check for collision: body cells don't include (1,0) yet, but after moving, the new head is at (1,0), and the body shifts. Then next steps can be planned towards the apple.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT seems better because it's in the direction of the apple.

So let's try:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Check for collision: (2,1) isn't in body cells, so safe.
Now, new head is (2,1), and the body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,1)]? Wait no—because the initial body was six segments. When moving, the head moves to (2,1), and each body segment follows. So after move 1:

Body becomes [(2,1), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]? Or perhaps the initial body was from (1,2) upwards, so when moving to (2,1), the new head is at (2,1), and the first body segment becomes (1,7), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think that after each move, the snake's body includes all previous positions except the tail unless an apple was eaten. But in this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so the tail would shrink.

Wait no—the movement update says that when eating the apple, the tail doesn't shrink. So without eating the apple, each move shifts the body: new head is added, and tail is removed.

But initially, the snake's body has 6 segments (excluding head). So total length is 7. Each move adds a new segment at the head and removes one from the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So after moving to (2,1), the new body would be [(2,1), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]. Because we added (2,1) as head and removed the last segment which was (1,2).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the initial body was [(1,7), (1,6), ..., (1,2)], which is six segments. So moving to (2,1), the new body would be [(2,1)] + the previous six segments except the last one? Or does it append?

I think I'm getting stuck on this, so perhaps a better approach is to simulate each move and check for collisions.

Let me try:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Is (2,1) safe? Yes, because body cells are [(1,7), ..., (1,2)].
After moving, the new head is at (2,1). The body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,1)]? Or perhaps it's [(2,1)] followed by the previous segments except the last one.

Wait, no—the snake's body after each move is all the positions from head to tail. So when moving to (2,1), the new head is at (2,1), and the body segments are the previous ones shifted: so (1,7) moves to where (1,6) was, etc., but I think it's better to consider that each move appends the new position and removes the last one.

So initial body: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]
After moving RIGHT:
new head = (2,1)
body becomes [(2,1), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Now, after move 1: head is at (2,1). Now, next moves.

Move 2: UP → (2,2)
Check if (2,2) is in body cells [(2,1), (1,7), ...]. No. Safe.
So now, new head is (2,2), body becomes [(2,2), (2,1), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]

Move 3: UP → (2,3)
Check if safe: yes.

Body after move 3: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]

Continue moving up until reaching y=6.

But wait, the apple is at (3,6). So to get there, I need to go right again.

Wait, after move 3, head is at (2,3). Maybe next moves:

Move 4: RIGHT → (3,3)
Check if safe: yes.

Body becomes [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,7), (1,6)]

Move 5: UP → (3,4)

Body: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,7)]

Continue moving up:

Move 6: UP → (3,5)
Body: [(3,5), (3,4), ...]

Move 7: UP → (3,6) which is the apple.

So in total, that's seven moves. But let's check for any possible collisions during these steps.

After each move:

1. Move RIGHT to (2,1): safe.
2. Move UP to (2,2): safe.
3. Move UP to (2,3): safe.
4. Move RIGHT to (3,3): safe.
5. Move UP to (3,4): safe.
6. Move UP to (3,5): safe.
7. Move UP to (3,6): apple.

But wait, the initial direction is DOWN, so after moving RIGHT for the first move, can I change directions as needed?

Yes, because once you make a move in a different direction, it's allowed as long as it doesn't reverse (which would be UP from DOWN).

Wait no—changing direction isn't restricted beyond not reversing. So from DOWN, any move except UP is allowed.

But after the first move is RIGHT, which is fine, then subsequent moves can be any direction except opposite of the current direction.

Wait, I'm getting confused about movement restrictions.

Movement rules say: if direction is NONE, any move is allowed. Otherwise, you cannot reverse direction (e.g., moving UP when last was DOWN). So each move must not be in the exact opposite direction.

So after initial direction DOWN:

- First move can't be UP.
But I'm starting at DOWN and making a RIGHT move first.

Wait no—direction is the current movement direction. If you make a move, that becomes the new direction, unless it's the reverse of the previous one.

So perhaps more accurately: if your last move was in direction D, you can't make a move in direction opposite to D next.

For example:

- If last move was DOWN, next move can't be UP.
- Similarly for other directions.

But after making a RIGHT move first, then next moves can be any except LEFT.

Wait no—RIGHT is the initial move. So after that, you can make any move except LEFT because it's opposite of RIGHT.

Wait, no—the directions are such that each has an opposite:

- UP and DOWN
- LEFT and RIGHT

So if your last direction was RIGHT, next can't be LEFT.

Similarly, if your last direction was LEFT, next can't be RIGHT.

But if your last move wasn't in a straight line (like moving RIGHT then UP), the previous direction is considered for collision with the body.

Wait, perhaps movement restrictions are that you cannot make a 180-degree turn. So from any direction D, you can't immediately turn into -D.

So after each move, your next move can't be in the exact opposite direction.

So let's plan the moves:

Move 1: RIGHT (from DOWN is allowed because RIGHT isn't opposite of DOWN)
Now, direction is RIGHT.

Move 2: UP (allowed because UP isn't opposite of RIGHT)
Direction is UP.

Move 3: UP (same direction as before, allowed)
But moving from (2,3) to (2,4), etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. The main point is that each move's direction can't be the exact opposite of the previous move.

So planning:

1. Start at DOWN.
   - Possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

First move: RIGHT → (2,1). Now, direction is RIGHT.

Next move cannot be LEFT.

Move 2: UP → (2,2). Now, direction is UP.

Move 3: UP → (2,3). Direction still UP.

Move 4: RIGHT → (3,3). Now, direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

But wait, moving from (2,3) to (3,3) is a RIGHT move after an UP move. Since previous was UP, next move can't be DOWN. But we're moving RIGHT, which is allowed.

Move 5: UP → (3,4). Direction is UP.

Move 6: UP → (3,5). Still UP.

Move 7: UP → (3,6). Apple located here.

So total moves: 7.

But let's check if any of these positions after each move are in the body:

After Move 1: (2,1) not in body.
After Move 2: (2,2) not in body.
Move 3: (2,3) safe.
Move 4: (3,3) safe.
Move 5: (3,4) safe.
Move 6: (3,5) safe.
Move 7: (3,6) is the apple.

But wait, when moving to (3,6), is that position already part of the body? Let's check:

After each move, the body segments are added at the head and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten. So let's track the body after each step.

Initial state:
Head: (1,1)
Body: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Body becomes [ (2,1) ] + initial body without last segment? Or is it the new head and the previous segments except tail.

Wait no—the movement rule says that when you move, you add a new segment at the head and remove one from the tail unless an apple is eaten. So after each non-apple move:

new_body = [new_head] + body[:-1]

So after Move 1 (RIGHT to (2,1)):

body was [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]
new_head is (2,1)
so new_body = [ (2,1) ] + initial body[:-1] → [ (2,1), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

Now, check if new_head is in new_body: no.

After Move 1:

Head: (2,1)
Body: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Move 2: UP → (2,2)

new_head = (2,2)
body after move: [ (2,2) ] + previous body[:-1] → [ (2,2), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]

Check collision with body: no.

Move 3: UP → (2,3)

new_head = (2,3)
body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ]

No collision.

Move 4: RIGHT → (3,3)

new_head = (3,3)
body becomes [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,7), (1,6) ]

Check collision: no.

Move 5: UP → (3,4)

new_head = (3,4)
body: [ (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,7) ]

No collision.

Move 6: UP → (3,5)

new_head = (3,5)
body: [ (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ]

No collision.

Move 7: UP → (3,6)

Check if body includes (3,6): no.

So after this move, the snake reaches the apple at (3,6). So it takes 7 moves.

But wait, is there a shorter path? Let's think.

Alternative approach:

After initial RIGHT to (2,1), maybe make more RIGHT moves first.

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Move 2: RIGHT → (3,1)
Then move UP six times to reach (3,7). But that would take longer. Alternatively, perhaps moving up as much as possible.

Wait no, but the apple is at (3,6), which is two steps right and five up from initial position.

But since we can only change direction without reversing, perhaps another path is better.

Alternatively:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Move 2: UP → (2,2)
Move 3: RIGHT → (3,2)
Then move UP four times to (3,6). That's a total of 6 moves? Let me check:

1. Move RIGHT to (2,1)
2. Move UP to (2,2)
3. Move RIGHT to (3,2) – direction is now RIGHT
4. Then need to make sure next move isn't LEFT.

Wait after moving RIGHT from (2,2), can we move UP again? Yes.

Move 4: UP → (3,3)
Move 5: UP → (3,4)
Move 6: UP → (3,5)
Move 7: UP → (3,6)

Still seven moves. So no improvement.

Another approach:

After Move 1: RIGHT to (2,1)
Move 2: DOWN? Wait no—initial direction was DOWN, but after first move is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT.

Wait, movement restrictions are based on the previous direction's opposite. So if last move was RIGHT, next cannot be LEFT. But moving DOWN after RIGHT is allowed because it's not opposite of RIGHT.

So maybe:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Move 2: DOWN → (2,0). Now direction is DOWN.
But then can't move UP next.

But that's taking us away from the apple, so probably worse.

Alternatively, perhaps after Move 1: RIGHT to (2,1), then make U-turns? Not sure.

Wait, maybe a different initial move. Instead of moving RIGHT first, could we move DOWN?

No—starting direction is DOWN, but moving DOWN would be allowed as first move. Wait, no—the initial state has the snake's head at (1,1) and body following. The movement from there can be any except UP because last move was implied to be something else? Or maybe it's considered that the initial direction is NONE.

Wait, perhaps the initial direction is NONE, meaning first move can be any direction. Then each subsequent move cannot be opposite of previous direction.

So if I choose DOWN as the first move:

Move 1: DOWN → (1,0)
Then Move 2 can't be UP.
But moving down gets further away from apple at (3,6).

Alternatively, initial move RIGHT to get closer.

I think the optimal path is seven moves.

So the answer is 7.
</think>

The snake needs to make a series of moves starting from (1,1) to reach the apple at (3,6). By moving right and then up without reversing direction, it takes exactly seven steps.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (1,1), body follows behind.
2. **Move Right**: Move from (1,1) → (2,1).
3. **Move Up**: From (2,1) to (2,2).
4. **Continue Moving Up**: To (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), and (2,6).
5. **Move Right Again**: From (2,6) → (3,6).

Each move avoids collisions with the body by changing directions appropriately without reversing.

**Answer**: \boxed{7}
