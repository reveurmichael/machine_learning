changing direction=new_state.direction or from UNKNOW to "RIGHT" code will not help. Please fix. if we got "UNKNOW", it's a good thing, because it tells us that something wrong happened easier, and we have to fix the earlier stage problem instead of things one. So it's is a fail fast philosophy. and I like it.
