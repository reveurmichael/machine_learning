{"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "LEFT"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (4,7) and needs to move towards (6,5). By moving Right, then Down, then Left, the snake avoids immediate collisions and ensures a path leading to the apple while allowing for a safe next move. Each step is chosen to maintain grid boundaries and avoid self-collisions, ensuring the snake can safely reach the apple."}
