{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 5 times (to reduce x from 8 to 3) and down once (to reduce y from 9 to 8). Each left move avoids collisions as the head moves left of the vertical body segment, and the final down move reaches the apple. After eating, there are legal moves available (e.g., left, right, down)."
