========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (2,5) to eat the apple at (0,3). 

First, I'll visualize the grid. The snake's head is at (2,5), which is somewhere in the middle. The body cells are given as [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]. So, the snake is extending from the head down to (7,2). 

The apple is at (0,3), which is on the left side of the grid. The current direction is LEFT, so the snake was moving towards decreasing x-values before this move.

To get to the apple, I need to move west (LEFT) twice because the apple is two columns to the left from the head's x-coordinate (2 -> 0). However, just moving left might cause collisions with the body or the walls. 

Looking at the body cells, after the head, the next cell is (3,5), which is directly to the right of the head. If I move LEFT once, the new head would be at (1,5). Then, for the second move, I need to go LEFT again to (0,5). But wait, from (1,5) moving left to (0,5), I have to make sure that (0,5) isn't occupied by any body part except possibly the tail.

Looking at the body list: The last cell is (7,2), which is far away. So after the first move, the body will shift as usual. Let me think about each step:

1. First move: LEFT to (1,5). Check for collision:
   - New head (1,5) should be within bounds.
   - The body cells are [(3,5), ...], so (1,5) isn't in the body except maybe if it's the tail. But the tail is at (7,2), so no collision.

2. Second move: LEFT to (0,5). Now check:
   - (0,5) is within bounds.
   - The body cells after first move would be shifted. After moving LEFT once, the head moves to (1,5), and the old head (2,5) becomes part of the body. So the new body starts with (2,5), followed by (3,5), etc.

When I'm at (0,5), I need to check if it's not occupied by any body except possibly the tail. Since after two moves, the tail would have moved twice as well, but since we're eating an apple, the body grows only on the first move? Wait, no—only when new_head == apple.

Wait, in this case, is (0,5) the apple's position? No, the apple is at (0,3), so I'm still not there. So after moving LEFT twice to reach (0,5), I need another two moves down to get from y=5 to y=3.

But wait, each move can only change direction if it's not reversing. The current direction is LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse. So from LEFT, the allowed directions are UP or DOWN or continue LEFT.

Wait, no—the movement rules say you can't reverse. So from LEFT, you can choose any direction except RIGHT for the first move. Wait, no: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is LEFT, you may not choose RIGHT next; similarly for others.

So in this case, after moving LEFT once, the new direction would be LEFT again or change to UP or DOWN but not RIGHT.

Wait, let me clarify:

The initial direction is LEFT. So for the first move, I can choose any direction except RIGHT because that's reversing. Wait no—the rule says: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed.

So in this case, the initial direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT. So after moving LEFT once, the new direction must be either UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But I need to get from (2,5) to (0,3), which requires two LEFT moves and then two DOWN moves? Or maybe a different path.

Wait, let me think of the Manhattan distance: |2-0| = 2 in x-direction, |5-3|=2 in y. So total steps needed are 4, but direction-wise, I need to move LEFT twice and DOWN twice.

But since after each move, the body changes, I have to make sure that the path doesn't collide with itself.

Alternatively, maybe a different approach: Move DOWN first, then LEFT, etc., but considering the current direction is LEFT, moving DOWN would require checking if it's allowed (since LEFT's reverse is RIGHT).

Wait, after moving LEFT once, the new direction can be anything except RIGHT. So perhaps:

Move 1: LEFT to (1,5). Now direction is LEFT.

Move 2: LEFT again to (0,5). Direction remains LEFT.

Now I'm at (0,5), but need to get down to y=3.

But moving from (0,5) towards (0,3) would require two DOWN moves. However, each move must not reverse direction. From LEFT, the next directions can't be RIGHT.

So after being in direction LEFT, I could change to DOWN as long as it's not a reversal.

Wait, current direction is LEFT; next direction can be UP or DOWN because they are not reverses. So:

Move 3: DOWN from (0,5) to (0,4). Now direction is DOWN.

Move 4: DOWN again to (0,3), which is the apple's position. Then, eat the apple and grow.

But wait, I need to check for collisions at each step.

Let me simulate:

Initial state:
- Head: (2,5)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]

Move 1: LEFT to (1,5). New head is (1,5).

Check collision:
- new_head is within bounds.
- Does (1,5) collide with any body cell except possibly the tail? The body starts at (3,5), so no.

Body update since not eating apple: Insert old head (2,5) into body. Now body becomes [(2,5), (3,5), ..., (7,2)]. Then remove tail (7,2). So new body is [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (7,3)].

Move 2: LEFT to (0,5).

Check collision:
- New head (0,5) within bounds.
- Body cells after move1 are [(2,5), ...], so (0,5) is not in body except possibly the new tail. The new body after move2 would be [ (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., (7,4)]. So no collision.

Body update: Insert old head (1,5). Remove tail (7,3). Body becomes [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4)].

Now at (0,5).

Move 3: DOWN to (0,4).

Check collision:
- new_head (0,4) is within bounds.
- Does it collide with any body cell except the tail? Current body after move2 is [(1,5), ...], so no.

Body update: Insert old head (0,5). Remove tail (7,4). Body becomes [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (6,4)].

Move 4: DOWN to (0,3).

Check collision:
- new_head is at apple position (0,3).
- Does it collide with any body cell except the tail? After move3, body is [(0,5), (1,5), ...], so no.

Eat the apple. So body grows by 1; don't remove tail.

So after eating, body becomes [old_head (0,4), followed by old body, plus new head]. Wait, let me think about it step by step:

After move3:
- Head is at (0,5)
- Body is [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (6,4)]

Move4: direction DOWN to (0,4). But wait, no—move4 is moving from (0,5) to (0,4).

Wait, in move3, I moved from (0,5) to (0,4). Then, in move4, moving down again would take me to (0,3), which is the apple.

But when I eat the apple at (0,3), according to the movement rules:

- Insert old head (0,4) into body.
- Since new_head == apple position, do not remove tail. So body length increases by 1.

So after move4, the body would be [ (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), ..., (6,4)]. Then, the new head is (0,3).

Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the steps. Maybe it's better to outline each move step-by-step:

Move 1:
- Direction: LEFT
- New Head: (1,5)
- Check collision: No.
- Body becomes [(2,5), (3,5), ..., (7,4)].

Move 2:
- Direction: LEFT
- New Head: (0,5)
- Check collision: No.
- Body becomes [(1,5), (2,5), ..., (7,4)].

Move3:
- Direction: DOWN
- New Head: (0,4)
- Check collision: Yes? Because after move2, the body includes (1,5), etc. Wait, no—because in move3, the new head is (0,4). The body after move2 is [(1,5), (2,5), ..., (7,4)]. So (0,4) isn't part of the body except possibly if it's the tail.

Wait, no—the tail after move2 is (7,4). So moving down to (0,4) doesn't collide with any body cell except maybe itself. Wait, no—body cells are [(1,5), ..., (7,4)], so (0,4) isn't there.

So collision check passes.

Move3: Head at (0,4), direction DOWN.

Body update since not eating apple yet:
- Insert old head (0,5). Body becomes [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (6,4)].
- Remove tail (7,4). So new body is [(0,5), (1,5), ..., (6,4)].

Move4:
- Direction: DOWN
- New Head: (0,3)
- Check collision: No, since body after move3 is [(0,5), ...], and apple is at (0,3).

Eat the apple. So:

- Insert old head (0,4) into body.
- Do not remove tail.

So new body becomes [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), ..., (6,4)].

Thus, no collision occurs, and the snake successfully eats the apple.

Therefore, the sequence of moves is LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN. But since each move can only be one step at a time, I need to represent this as four separate steps in the JSON array.
</think>

The snake needs to make four moves: LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN. Each move should be executed in order without reversing direction.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"]
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (0, 3). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
