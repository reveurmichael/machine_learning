========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,8) with a horizontal body along y=8. To reach (5,3), the snake needs to move right 5 units and down 5 units. First, moving UP avoids the left wall and shifts the body upward. Then, moving RIGHT five times navigates the head to (5,9) while the body follows. Finally, moving DOWN six times (net 5 down) brings the head to (5,3) (the apple), growing the body safely without collision. All moves avoid walls and body segments, and after eating, there are valid next moves."
