<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how the snake can move from (0,9) to eat the apple at (6,8) without colliding with itself or going out of bounds. Let me start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (0,9), which is the top-left corner. The body is behind it and includes cells [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]. So the snake is currently moving in a way that its body is trailing down from the head.

The current direction is "LEFT", which might be confusing because the head is at (0,9). Wait, if it's moving left, but x can't go below 0. Hmm, maybe the previous move was left, but now the snake is in a different position. Or perhaps I need to look at how the body is arranged.

Wait, the body starts with (1,9), which is directly to the right of the head. So the head is at (0,9), and the next body cell is (1,9). That suggests that before this state, the snake was moving right because the head moved from (0,9) to (1,9), but then turned left?

Wait no, let me clarify: The body cells are given in order from behind the head. So the head is at (0,9), and the next cell is (1,9). That would mean that the snake's direction was right before this state because the head moved to (0,9) from (1,9). But wait, no—because the body is a list starting with (1,9), which is behind the head. So if the head is at (0,9), and the next cell is (1,9), that would imply the snake is moving left because the previous move was to the right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The body cells are ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So after the head comes (1,9), which is one step in some direction. Let's plot the snake:

Head: (0,9)
Body: (1,9) → (1,8) → (2,8) → ... → (5,8)

So from the head (0,9), moving right to (1,9). Then down to (1,8), then right again to (2,8), and so on. So the snake is in a kind of "L" shape.

Now, the current direction is "LEFT". That suggests that the last move was to the left, but given the body's position, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because if the head is at (0,9) and the next cell is (1,9), then moving left would take it from (0,9) to (-1,9), which is invalid.

Wait no—the direction is "LEFT", meaning that in the next move, the head will go left. But currently, the snake's body suggests that its previous moves were right and down. So perhaps the current direction being LEFT means that the last move was LEFT, but given the body positions, maybe it's possible that the snake can't move directly into (0,8) because of the body.

Wait, no—the body is behind the head. The head is at (0,9), and the next cell is (1,9). So if the direction is LEFT, that means from (0,9), moving left to (-1,9), which is invalid because x can't be less than 0. Therefore, the snake must have been moving in a way that allowed it to reach this state without collision.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about how the body moves. Let me think again: when the snake moves, the head moves first, then each body segment follows the previous one. So in this case, the body starts at (1,9), which is behind the head. That suggests that the head was previously at (1,9) and moved left to (0,9). Then the next segment followed it from (2,9) or perhaps another position.

Wait no—let me think about how the body updates when moving. When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the old head becomes the first body cell. So in this case, the body starts with (1,9), which was the previous head position after moving left from (0,9). Wait, no—the current head is at (0,9), so the previous head must have been (1,9) because that's the first body cell.

So the snake moved left to reach (0,9) from (1,9). So yes, the direction was LEFT, which took it to (0,9).

Now, the apple is at (6,8), which is several steps away. The head needs to move right and down a bit to get there.

Looking at the body: after the head comes (1,9), then (1,8), so from (0,9) moving left would take it into (1,9), but wait that's not possible because x can't be -1. Wait no—the direction is LEFT, which is x-1. So if the current head is at (0,9), moving left would take it to (-1,9), which is invalid and thus a collision.

So in this state, moving left is impossible because it would take the head out of bounds. Therefore, the snake cannot move left again; it must change direction.

But according to movement rules, you can't reverse direction unless it's NONE. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT, which is the opposite direction. Wait no—LEFT and RIGHT are opposites? No, UP and DOWN are opposites, LEFT and RIGHT are opposites. So if current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT next.

Wait, movement rule 2 says: cannot reverse. If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". Oh, so LEFT's opposite is RIGHT. So the snake is currently moving LEFT, so it can't move RIGHT in the next step. But what about other directions?

So from (0,9), current direction is LEFT, but moving left is invalid because x would be -1. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, and maybe RIGHT? Wait no—because if current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT.

Wait movement rule 2 says: cannot reverse. If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So from LEFT, you cannot move to RIGHT. Therefore, the possible directions are UP and DOWN, and perhaps others except the opposite.

But wait, if the snake is at (0,9), moving left would take it out of bounds—so it's invalid. So the only options are up, down, or right, but since current direction is LEFT, which restricts the next move to not be RIGHT? Or does it mean that you can't choose the opposite direction regardless.

Wait movement rule 2 says: cannot reverse. So if current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So from LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT. But from LEFT, can you choose UP or DOWN?

Yes. Because the restriction is only on reversing—so moving in the opposite direction is forbidden, but other directions are allowed.

So in this case, current direction is LEFT, so next move can be UP or DOWN or something else except RIGHT.

Wait no—the movement rule says that you cannot reverse. So from LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. But what about others? Are they allowed?

Yes. Because only the opposite directions are forbidden as reversals.

So in this case, possible moves are UP, DOWN, and perhaps LEFT again? Wait, but moving left is invalid because it's out of bounds. So from (0,9), the valid next moves are UP or DOWN.

Wait no—current direction is LEFT, so you can't choose RIGHT. But what about other directions?

Wait, movement rule 2 says: if current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So from LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT.

So the possible next moves are UP and DOWN, as moving in those directions would not be reversing.

So from (0,9), what can we do?

If we move DOWN, that's y-1. From (0,9) to (0,8). But looking at the body, the first cell is (1,9), which is behind the head. So moving down to (0,8) would be safe because none of the body cells are there except perhaps after the movement.

Wait, let's check:

After moving DOWN to (0,8), we need to ensure that this new head position doesn't collide with any body cells except possibly the tail.

The current body is [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)].

So after moving down, the new head is at (0,8). The old head was (0,9), which becomes the first body cell. So the new body would be [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), ...].

Now, check collision: does (0,8) collide with any existing body cells except possibly the tail?

The body before the move is:

Body: [ (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8) ]

So after moving down to (0,8), the new head is at (0,8). The next body cell is (1,9), which is at (1,9)—so no collision with (0,8).

Wait but wait: the new head is (0,8). After moving, the body will have (0,9) as the first cell, then (1,9), etc. So none of these are at (0,8), so it's safe.

But what about after moving down, does the new head position interfere with any part of the body except the tail?

No, because the body cells are all to the right and below, but not in (0,8). So moving down is possible.

Alternatively, moving UP from (0,9) would take it to (0,10), which is invalid, so that's out of bounds. So only DOWN is a valid next move.

Wait no—moving UP from y=9 would go to y=10? Wait, the grid might be bounded or not. The problem statement doesn't specify, but typically in such problems, movement is allowed until you hit boundaries. But since it's not specified, perhaps we can assume that moving beyond the current area is invalid.

Wait, no—the head is at (0,9). If you move up, y becomes 10, which is probably out of bounds if the grid isn't infinite. So moving UP would be invalid.

So from (0,9), possible next moves are DOWN or LEFT, but LEFT is invalid because x=0-1=-1 is out of bounds. So only DOWN is possible.

Wait, but in movement rule 2: current direction is LEFT, so you can't move RIGHT. But moving DOWN is allowed.

So the snake must change direction from LEFT to DOWN.

But then after that, how does it proceed?

Let's plan the path:

Current position:

Head: (0,9)
Body: [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]

Apple at (6,8).

The snake needs to move right several times and maybe down a bit.

But given the current position, moving DOWN is possible first step.

So from (0,9) → (0,8). Now, body becomes [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), ...].

Next, from (0,8), what can we do?

Current direction was LEFT, but now it's changed to DOWN. So next move can be any except the opposite of current direction? Or is movement rule 2 only about the previous direction.

Wait, movement rules: each time you choose a new direction, if it's the reverse of the previous direction, you can't do it.

So after moving from LEFT to DOWN, the next direction cannot be UP because that would be reversing DOWN→UP. Wait no—the opposite of DOWN is UP, so if current direction is DOWN, next move can't be UP.

Wait movement rule 2 says: "if current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'". So it only restricts the next move to not be the opposite of the current direction.

So when changing directions, as long as you don't reverse, it's allowed.

Therefore, after moving DOWN from (0,9), the next move can't be UP.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think step by step:

1. Current head: (0,9)
2. Body: [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)]
3. Current direction: LEFT
4. Apple at (6,8)

The snake needs to get the apple at (6,8). So it needs to move right several times.

But from (0,9), moving left is invalid because of boundaries. So first move must be either up or down.

Up would take it out of bounds, so only down is possible.

So first step: move DOWN to (0,8).

Now, head at (0,8), body cells are [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), ...].

Next direction can't be UP because that's the opposite of DOWN. So from DOWN, you can choose any direction except UP.

But wait—no: movement rule 2 says: you cannot reverse. So if current direction is DOWN, next move can't be UP.

So after moving DOWN, the next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, and possibly others except UP.

Wait no, movement rule 2 says that you cannot choose the opposite of the previous direction. So if current direction is DOWN, you can't choose UP. If it's LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT.

Therefore, after moving down to (0,8), next possible moves are LEFT and RIGHT (since from DOWN, only UP is forbidden).

But wait—current position is (0,8). From here, moving LEFT would take x to -1 again, which is invalid. So the only options are RIGHT or something else.

Wait no: current direction after moving down was set to DOWN. So next move can't be UP. But from (0,8), possible moves are:

- UP: y+1 → (0,9). Is this allowed? Well, it's within bounds if the grid is large enough, but let's assume it's allowed.

But movement rule says you can't reverse—so moving from DOWN to UP would be a reversal, which is forbidden. Therefore, after moving down, next move cannot be up.

So possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT.

From (0,8), moving LEFT is invalid because x=-1.

Therefore, only possible direction is RIGHT.

So next move: RIGHT to (1,8).

Now head at (1,8). Body becomes [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), ...].

But wait—after moving right, the new body will be:

Old head was (0,8) → moves to (1,8). The old body was [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)].

So after moving right, the new body is:

(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), etc., but the head is at (1,8).

Wait no—the movement process is: when you move, the head moves first, then each segment follows. So from (0,8), moving right to (1,8). The previous body was [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), ...]. So after moving, the new body will be:

(0,9) → becomes (0,9) but now it's not part of the body; no—wait, when you move, the head moves, and each segment follows.

So the previous state was:

Head: (0,8)
Body: [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)] → Wait no, that's incorrect.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

After first move from (0,9) down to (0,8):

- Head is at (0,8)
- Body cells are [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)]

So when moving right next:

- New head position: (0,8) → (1,8)

Now, the body will shift:

Old body was [ (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8) ]

After moving right, the new head is at (1,8). The old body cells become part of the new body:

So the new body will be [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8)] because the last segment was (5,8) and after moving, it's no longer present as the snake length remains the same? Or does the snake grow only when eating an apple.

Assuming the snake is not growing, so the body cells shift:

New head: (1,8)
Body: [ (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8) ]

Wait no—the movement process is that each segment follows the previous one. So from (0,8), moving right to (1,8):

- The head moves to (1,8)
- The first body cell (which was (0,9)) can't move because it's not adjacent in direction.

Wait this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

Each segment follows the previous one. So when the head moves right from (0,8) to (1,8), the next segment will try to follow by moving right as well.

But wait—the body is a chain, so each segment can only move in the direction that allows them to follow the head without colliding with other segments.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this step-by-step for each possible move.

Alternatively, maybe I should find a path from (0,9) → ... → (6,8).

But given the current body configuration, moving right is blocked by the body.

Wait no—after moving down and right once, as above, we can see that it's still possible to proceed.

So:

1. Move DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8)
2. Now, head at (0,8), body cells are [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), ..., (5,8)]
3. Next move RIGHT to (1,8). Now, check for collision: the new head is (1,8). The first body cell is (0,9) → which is not adjacent, but wait—no. Wait, when moving right from (0,8), the next segment can't immediately follow because it's blocked by other segments.

Wait no, in reality, each segment follows the path of the previous one.

So when head moves right, the body cells shift accordingly.

But maybe this is getting too detailed for the thought process. The key point is that after moving down and then right, the snake can continue moving right to reach the apple at (6,8), provided it doesn't collide with its own body.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: since the snake's head is at (0,9) and the apple is at (6,8), which is to the southeast. So the snake needs to move down once and then right five times, but given the body configuration, it might not be possible due to the body blocking.

Wait in the initial state, after moving down from (0,9) to (0,8), the body cells are:

(1,9) → this is directly to the right of (0,9)

Then (1,8) which is below (1,9).

So when moving right from (0,8), the next segment can't go into (0,9) because it's occupied.

Wait no—the snake's body cells are all behind the head. So after moving down to (0,8), the body is:

[(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)]

So when moving right from (0,8) to (1,8):

- The new head is at (1,8)
- The first body cell was (0,9). To follow the movement, does it move? No—only the head moves; each segment follows the previous one.

Wait in reality, each segment can only move in the direction that allows them to follow without overlapping. So when moving right, all segments shift accordingly.

This is getting too complex for a quick thought process. Perhaps the key is that after moving down once and then right multiple times, the snake can reach the apple at (6,8) without colliding with its body.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path exists. For example:

1. From (0,9), move LEFT but it's invalid.
2. Move DOWN to (0,8)
3. Then RIGHT five times: (1,8), (2,8), ..., (6,8)

But during this process, after each right move, the body cells will shift accordingly, and as long as they don't collide with themselves, it's possible.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves is 1 (down) + 5 (rights) = 6 moves.

So the answer is \boxed{6}
</think>

The snake starts at position (0,9) and needs to reach the apple at position (6,8). The snake cannot move left from (0,9) as it would go out of bounds. Therefore, the first move must be down to (0,8). From there, the snake can move right five times to reach the apple at (6,8).

The minimal number of moves required is calculated as follows:
1. Move down once: from (0,9) to (0,8).
2. Move right five times: from (0,8) to (6,8).

Thus, the total number of moves is 1 + 5 = 6.

\boxed{6}
