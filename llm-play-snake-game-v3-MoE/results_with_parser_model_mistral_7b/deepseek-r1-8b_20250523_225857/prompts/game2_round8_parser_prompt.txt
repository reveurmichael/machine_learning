<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where I need to plan a path for the snake's head from position (2,1) to eat the apple at (7,5). The snake is currently positioned with its head at (2,1) and the body segments given. Let me break down what I know.

First, the directions allowed are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but you can't reverse direction on the first move. So if the current direction is UP, next move can't be DOWN, same for LEFT and RIGHT. The snake can't collide with its own body except when the tail is about to move, which happens during normal movement or eating an apple.

The snake's body cells are given as [(2,2)], so right now the head is at (2,1), then the body starts at (2,2). So the current state is that the snake is moving upwards from (2,1) to (2,2).

The goal is to reach (7,5). The Manhattan distance between (2,1) and (7,5) is |7-2| + |5-1| = 5+4=9. So a direct path would take at least 9 moves, but we have to consider the snake's movement rules and possible obstacles.

I need to plan a path that avoids collisions with itself and stays within grid bounds. Also, after eating the apple, there must be at least one move left to prevent trapping.

Let me visualize the grid. The head is at (2,1), body is at (2,2). Apple is at (7,5). So from (2,1), moving right and up seems necessary.

If I start by moving RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT. From (3,1), then continue RIGHT to move towards the apple's x-coordinate of 7. But I also need to manage the body segments so they don't collide with each other or the head as it moves.

Wait, the current body is [(2,2)], which means after the first move, the old head (2,1) will be inserted at the front of the body. So if I move RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1), the new head is (3,1). The old head becomes part of the body as [(2,1)], and then it's followed by (2,2). So the body after first move would be [(2,1), (2,2)].

Then, moving further RIGHT: from (4,1), but wait, that's too far. Wait, no, each move is one cell. From (3,1), next right to (4,1).

But I also need to check for collisions. The new head must not be on any body segment except possibly the tail.

Another thing: after eating the apple, the tail doesn't move, so I have to ensure that the snake's length increases by one. So if I eat the apple, I can grow without losing the tail.

But before that, I need to navigate through the grid avoiding self-collisions.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first is better? Let me see: from (2,1), moving UP would take me to (2,2). But wait, (2,2) is already occupied by the body. So can't move UP because that's a collision.

So first move must be RIGHT to (3,1). Then continue moving RIGHT towards the apple.

But let me think about how the body will grow. Each time I eat an apple, the snake grows, but if I don't eat it, the tail moves.

I need to plan steps where each new head position doesn't collide with any body segment except possibly the tail that's moving or not moving after eating.

So from (2,1):

Move 1: RIGHT to (3,1). Now, body becomes [(2,1), (2,2)].

Move 2: RIGHT to (4,1). Body becomes [(2,1), (2,2), (3,1)]? Wait, no. Wait, after moving to (4,1), the old head (3,1) is inserted at front of body, which was [(2,1), (2,2)]. So new body would be [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]. Then, since we didn't eat apple, we remove the tail (2,2). So body becomes [(3,1), (2,1)].

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Each move involves:

- Compute new head.
- Check collision with grid and body (excluding tail if it's about to move).
- If safe, update body:
   - Insert old head at front of body.
   - If new_head is apple, grow: keep tail, so body length increases by 1.
   - Else, remove last element (tail) to maintain length.

So after each move, the body is updated as follows:

Suppose current body is [B0, B1, ..., Bn], where B0 is head and Bn is tail.

After moving in some direction, new_head is computed. Check collision with body except possibly the last element (tail).

If safe, insert old head at front: [old_head, B0, B1, ..., Bn].

Then, if new_head is apple, grow by not removing tail: so body becomes [old_head, B0, B1, ..., Bn, new_head]. Wait no: the process is:

a. Insert old head at front of BODY (BODY1).

b. If new_head == apple, grow: do NOT remove the tail. So the new BODY remains as [old_head] + existing BODY.

c. Else, remove last element.

So in the case where I'm not eating the apple, after inserting the old head, I have to remove the tail.

Therefore, the body length remains the same unless we eat the apple.

This is a bit tricky. So let's try to plan step by step.

Starting at (2,1), with body [(2,2)].

Current direction: DOWN? Wait no, initial direction is given as "DOWN". Wait, no, in the problem statement, current direction is "DOWN".

Wait, I need to check the input again:

Head position: (2,1)

Current direction: "DOWN"

Body cells: [(2,2)]

Apple position: (7,5).

So the snake is currently moving down? But wait, from (2,1), moving DOWN would go to y=0. But (2,1) is already at y=1; moving down would take it to y=0.

But let's see what the initial state is.

Wait, perhaps I misread: the current direction is "DOWN", so if I try to move in that direction, the new head would be (2,0).

But that's okay as long as it doesn't collide with body. Let me check:

Current body is [(2,2)]. So new_head is (2,1) moving down to (2,0). Check if any BODY cells match this.

BODY cells are [(2,2)], which is not the same as (2,0), so no collision.

Then, update body: insert old head (2,1) at front ⇒ body becomes [(2,1), (2,2)].

Since new_head (2,0) is not apple, we remove tail. So new body is [(2,1), (2,2)]. Wait, but after insertion and removal of tail:

Wait, initial body was [BODY1=(2,2)], then after inserting old head, it becomes [(2,1), (2,2)]. Then since we didn't eat apple, remove the last element (which is the original BODY1). So new body is [(2,1)].

But that can't be right. Let me re-examine:

In the movement step 3a: insert old head at front of BODY list ⇒ if initial body was [(2,2)], after inserting old head (2,1), it becomes [(2,1), (2,2)].

Then, step 3c: remove last element (tail) ⇒ new body is [(2,1), (2,2)] minus the last element? Wait, no. The initial body was [BODY1=(2,2)], so after insertion, it's [old_head, BODY1]. Then, if not eating apple, we remove the last element of this list. So in this case, the new body would be [old_head] only.

Wait, that can't be right because then the snake would have length 1 again.

No, wait: initial state is:

HEAD = (2,1)

BODY = [(2,2)]

So after moving down to (2,0):

- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head (2,1) at front of BODY ⇒ BODY becomes [(2,1), (2,2)].
- Since new_head is not apple, remove last element ⇒ BODY becomes [(2,1)].

So now the snake's body is just [(2,1)], which is the same as before. That seems odd because moving down would have caused the head to move, but the body remains in place. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe after each move, the body shifts forward, so when you don't eat apple, the tail moves. So from [(2,1), (2,2)], after moving, if you didn't eat apple, remove the last element (2,2), leaving [(2,1)] as body.

Wait, but that would mean the snake is just the head again, which might be problematic because it's difficult to grow further. Maybe starting with direction "DOWN" isn't the best idea here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is "DOWN", so I can't choose another direction on the first move except "DOWN". So if current direction is "DOWN", first move must be either "DOWN" again or any other direction? Wait no: according to rule 2, you cannot reverse on the first move. So if direction is "DOWN", next move can't be UP. It can still go DOWN again.

But moving down from (2,1) to (2,0), and then perhaps continue down further, but that's away from the apple at (7,5). That would take the snake to the bottom row, which is not helpful.

So perhaps it's better to change direction. But wait, can I change direction on the first move? No, because rule 2 says you can't reverse on the first move. So if initial direction is "DOWN", I have to continue moving down or maybe stay in place?

Wait, no: when you choose a direction different from current direction, it's allowed as long as it's not a reversal.

Wait, actually, rule 2 states that on the first move, you can't reverse. So if initial direction is "DOWN", next move can be any direction except UP. So you could go DOWN again or RIGHT or LEFT.

But in our case, moving LEFT from (2,1) to (1,1) would take us away from the apple. Moving RIGHT towards (3,1) seems better.

Wait, but initial current direction is "DOWN", so can I move RIGHT on first move? Is that allowed?

No, wait: rule 2 says you can't reverse on the first move. So if you're moving down (current direction), next move can't be UP, but you can still choose other directions like RIGHT or DOWN.

So in this case, moving RIGHT is allowed because it's not a reversal.

Therefore, initial move could be RIGHT to (3,1).

Then, after that, the body becomes [(2,1), (2,2)], and since we didn't eat apple, remove tail: new body is [(2,1)] again.

Hmm, same issue as before. So perhaps this approach isn't helpful because the snake's body remains at length 1 after each non-apple move.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to start moving RIGHT multiple times until the body grows enough to not collide when the head moves further right.

Let me try to plan a sequence:

1. Initial state: HEAD=(2,1), BODY=[(2,2)], DIRECTION="DOWN".

First move: choose RIGHT (since it's allowed on first move).

New head: (3,1)

Check collision with body [(2,2)]: no.

Insert old head at front ⇒ BODY becomes [(2,1), (2,2)].

Since new_head not apple, remove tail ⇒ BODY is [(2,1)].

Now, HEAD=(3,1), BODY=[(2,1)], DIRECTION=RIGHT.

Second move: continue RIGHT to (4,1).

Check collision with body [(2,1)]: no.

Insert old head (3,1) ⇒ BODY becomes [(3,1), (2,1)].

Since not apple, remove tail ⇒ BODY is [(3,1)].

HEAD=(4,1), DIRECTION=RIGHT.

Third move: RIGHT to (5,1).

BODY becomes [(4,1), (3,1)], then remove tail ⇒ [(4,1)].

Continue this until the head reaches x=7.

But each time we do this, the body is only [(n,1)] where n increases by 1 each step. So after k moves, body is [(k+2,1)]? Wait:

Wait, let's track step by step.

Move 1: RIGHT to (3,1)

BODY becomes [(2,1), (2,2)] → then remove tail → [(2,1)]

Move 2: RIGHT to (4,1)

BODY becomes [(3,1), (2,1)] → remove tail → [(3,1)]

Move 3: RIGHT to (5,1)

BODY becomes [(4,1), (3,1)] → remove tail → [(4,1)]

...

Continue this until:

After n moves, HEAD=(2 + n,1).

But we need to get to x=7, so n=5.

So move 6: RIGHT from (6,1) to (7,1). Check collision with body [(5,1)]: no.

Insert old head (6,1) ⇒ BODY becomes [(6,1), (5,1)].

Not apple, remove tail ⇒ [(6,1)].

Now, HEAD=(7,1), which is still below the apple at y=5. So now we need to move upwards towards y=5.

But from (7,1), moving UP each step:

Next moves would be UP to (7,2), (7,3), etc., while managing the body.

Each time, moving UP will make the head go higher. Let's see:

After reaching x=7 at (7,1):

Move 7: UP to (7,2)

BODY becomes [(6,1), (6,1)]? Wait no.

Wait, current HEAD is (7,1).

Body was [(6,1)] from previous step.

So moving UP to (7,2):

Check collision with body [(6,1)]: yes, because (6,1) is different from (7,2). So safe.

Insert old head (7,1) at front ⇒ BODY becomes [(7,1), (6,1)].

Since not apple, remove tail ⇒ [(7,1)].

Now, HEAD=(7,2).

Next move: UP to (7,3)

Check collision with body [(7,1)]: no.

Insert old head (7,2) ⇒ BODY becomes [(7,2), (7,1)].

Remove tail ⇒ [(7,2)].

Continue this until reach y=5:

Move 8: UP from (7,2) to (7,3)

BODY becomes [(7,2), (7,2)]

Wait no, after moving, old head is inserted at front. So new body is [(7,2), (7,1)] → then remove tail ⇒ [(7,2)].

Next move: UP to (7,4)

Similarly:

Move 9: UP from (7,3) to (7,4)

BODY becomes [(7,3), (7,2)] → remove tail ⇒ [(7,3)]

Move 10: UP from (7,4) to (7,5).

Check if (7,5) is apple: yes.

So in this step:

- New head is (7,5) which is the apple.

- Check collision with body: current body is [(7,3)] before insertion. So inserting old head (7,4) ⇒ new body becomes [(7,4), (7,3)].

Since we're eating the apple, we don't remove the tail. So final body is [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2), ..., all previous heads? Wait no.

Wait, after moving to apple:

- Insert old head at front ⇒ new body is [old_head] + existing BODY.

In this case, old_head is (7,4) when moving to (7,5).

So new body becomes [(7,4), (7,3)] before eating. Then, since we ate the apple, do not remove tail ⇒ final body is [(7,4), (7,3)].

But actually, after inserting, the body includes all previous heads. Wait no: each move only inserts the old head and may add new elements if growing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that when you eat the apple, the body grows by one segment without removing the tail.

So in this case:

After moving to (7,5), which is the apple:

- Insert old head (7,4) at front of body ⇒ new body is [(7,4), previous body].

Assuming previous body was [(7,3)], then new body after insertion is [(7,4), (7,3)].

Since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So final body is [(7,4), (7,3)].

But actually, the tail is now at (7,3), so the snake has grown by one segment. Now, to move further UP would be impossible because y=5 is the top of grid.

So total moves:

From (2,1) → 5 RIGHT moves to reach (7,1).

Then 4 UP moves to reach (7,5). But wait, in my earlier step-by-step, it took more steps because each UP move had to grow the body and manage tails. It seems like this path is too long.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to alternate RIGHT and UP moves after reaching x=2 or so, allowing the snake to grow without having to keep removing tails.

Wait, maybe I should think about the entire process differently.

Given that each move can only add one segment (when eating apple), it's necessary to plan a path where the snake can extend itself without colliding with its own body.

Perhaps a better strategy is to move RIGHT until x=7, then UP to reach y=5. But as I saw earlier, moving RIGHT from (2,1) would require multiple moves while keeping the body manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I should first grow the snake's length so that it can move upwards without colliding with itself.

For example:

Start at (2,1), BODY=[(2,2)].

First, eat an apple by moving in some direction where possible. But wait, initial position is (2,1) with body [(2,2)]. If I could move to (3,1), then insert old head and grow the snake. Let me try:

Move 1: RIGHT to (3,1)

Check collision: body is [(2,2)], so safe.

Insert old head ⇒ BODY becomes [(2,1), (2,2)].

Since not apple, remove tail ⇒ [(2,1)].

Now, HEAD=(3,1), DIRECTION=RIGHT.

Move 2: RIGHT to (4,1)

BODY becomes [(3,1), (2,1)] → remove tail ⇒ [(3,1)].

HEAD=(4,1).

Continue until x=7:

Each move adds one segment in the body, so after k moves from initial x=2, we reach x=2+k.

But each time, the body is a single segment behind the head. So when moving right, the snake can't grow its body unless it eats an apple, which only happens if it moves to (7,5).

Alternatively, perhaps after reaching x=7 at y=1, the snake can start growing upwards by repeatedly moving UP without eating apples.

Wait, but each UP move would require checking for collisions with body.

From (7,1), if I move UP to (7,2):

Check collision: body is [(6,1)] → no collision.

Insert old head ⇒ BODY becomes [(7,1), (6,1)].

Since not apple, remove tail ⇒ [(7,1)].

Then, next UP move to (7,3):

BODY becomes [(7,2), (7,1)] → remove tail ⇒ [(7,2)].

And so on until reaching y=5.

But in this way, the snake's body is only a single segment at each step, which seems inefficient. It might take too many moves to reach y=5.

Alternatively, maybe a better strategy is to first grow the snake's length by moving back and forth or in a spiral, allowing it to have multiple segments that don't collide when moving towards the target.

But I'm not sure if that would work without causing collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps once the head reaches x=7, the snake can move UP while growing its body by eating apples along the way. But since (7,5) is the only apple in the grid, it's impossible to eat another apple after that.

Wait, actually, in this problem, there is only one apple at (7,5). So the snake must reach there to consume it and grow once.

So perhaps the optimal path is:

1. Move RIGHT from (2,1) to (7,1), growing the body by one segment each time, as shown earlier.

2. Then move UP from (7,1) to (7,5), growing the body further until reaching the apple.

But I'm not sure if that's feasible without collision.

Wait, when moving RIGHT:

Each move adds a segment behind the head, so after k moves, the body is [(2+k, 1)].

When moving UP from (7,1):

Each UP move adds another segment behind the head, but since we're only adding one segment at each step, the body remains manageable.

But let's count the total number of moves:

From x=2 to x=7: that's 5 RIGHT moves.

Then from y=1 to y=5: that's 4 UP moves.

Total moves: 9.

But is this enough?

Wait, when moving UP from (7,1):

Move 6: UP to (7,2)

BODY becomes [(7,1), (6,1)] → remove tail ⇒ [(7,1)]

HEAD=(7,2).

Move 7: UP to (7,3)

BODY becomes [(7,2), (7,1)] → remove tail ⇒ [(7,2)]

HEAD=(7,3).

Move 8: UP to (7,4)

BODY becomes [(7,3), (7,2)] → remove tail ⇒ [(7,3)]

HEAD=(7,4).

Move 9: UP to (7,5) → eat apple.

BODY becomes [(7,4), (7,3)].

Thus, total moves: 9.

But wait, in this process, the body segments are each one step behind. So at each UP move, the snake's body is only one segment long, so no collision occurs.

Therefore, the snake can reach the apple in 9 moves by alternating RIGHT and UP movements after reaching x=7.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient path exists.

But considering that to reach x=7 from x=2 requires 5 moves, and then y=5 is 4 more moves, totaling 9. So this seems like the minimum number of moves required.

Thus, the minimal number of moves is 9.
</think>

To solve the problem of moving the snake from (2,1) to (7,5) with the given constraints, we can plan a path that minimizes the number of moves by strategically growing the snake's body and avoiding collisions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Move Right**: The snake starts at (2,1). It needs to move right towards x=7 while managing its body segments.
   
   - Each RIGHT move allows the snake to grow one segment behind without collision.
   
   - After 5 moves right: (2+5, 1) = (7,1).

2. **Move Up**: Once at (7,1), the snake needs to move up towards y=5.

   - Each UP move also allows the snake to grow one segment behind without collision.
   
   - After 4 more moves up: (7,1+4) = (7,5).

3. **Total Moves**: 5 RIGHT + 4 UP = 9 moves.

By carefully growing the snake's body each time it changes direction, the snake can reach the target in the minimum number of moves without colliding with itself.

**Answer:** The minimal number of moves required is \boxed{9}.
