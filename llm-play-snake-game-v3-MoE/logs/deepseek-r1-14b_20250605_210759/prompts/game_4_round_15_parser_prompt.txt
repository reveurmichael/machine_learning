========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's break down this problem step by step to figure out the safest path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with itself or going out of bounds.

First, let's understand the current state:

- **Head Position**: (5,7)
- **Current Direction**: "UP"
- **Body Cells**: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]
- **Apple Position**: (5,8)

From the body cells, I can see that the snake is currently moving upwards because each subsequent body cell has a lower y-coordinate. The tail is at (0,1). 

The apple is located one cell above the head at (5,8). Since the grid is 10x10, and coordinates go from (0,0) to (9,9), moving "UP" from (5,7) would take the head to (5,8), which is exactly where the apple is.

But wait, I need to check for any possible collisions. The new head position after moving up would be (5,8). Let's see if this cell is occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail.

Looking at the body cells:

- The first body segment behind the head is (5,6), which is directly below the head. Then each subsequent body part goes down to (0,1).

So none of the body segments are at (5,8). Therefore, moving up wouldn't cause a collision with any body part except possibly the tail in this case.

But wait, the tail is at (0,1), which is far from (5,8), so there's no issue. Also, since the apple is directly ahead, if we move into it, the snake will grow by one cell because it ate the apple.

So moving "UP" seems safe and direct. Let me check the movement rules again:

- The direction cannot be reversed immediately. Since the current direction is "UP", the next move can't be "DOWN". But since we're moving "UP" into the apple, that's allowed.

Additionally, after eating the apple, the body will grow, so the snake becomes longer by one segment. However, this shouldn't block our path because the apple was directly ahead.

Therefore, the optimal move is to go "UP" in the first step.
</think>

{"moves": ["UP"], "reasoning": "Moving UP from (5,7) to (5,8) where the apple is located is safe as it doesn't collide with any body segments and is within grid bounds."}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
