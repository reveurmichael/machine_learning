========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to plan a safe path for the snake from (5,5) towards (9,7), considering all the given constraints and rules.

First, the snake is at position (5,5). The apple is at (9,7). So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate. The required number of RIGHT moves should be 4 more than LEFTs because 9-5=4. Similarly, for UP moves, since 7-5=2, we need two more UPs than DOWNs.

Next, looking at the current direction, it's NONE, which means I can choose any initial move except a reverse after that. But considering safety and moving towards the apple, starting with RIGHT makes sense because we're closer to x=9 in the right direction.

However, if I move RIGHT first, where does that place us? Let's say head moves to (6,5). Now, I need to check for collisions. The body cells are currently empty since it's an empty list. So moving RIGHT is safe. Then, update the body by adding the old head at the front and removing the tail if necessary.

But wait, after the first move, the new head is (6,5), and there's no tail yet because the body was initially empty except for the head. Wait, no—the body cells are given as an empty list, which means the snake only has a head and no other segments. So moving RIGHT would add (6,5) to the body, making the new head (6,5), and since there's no tail, perhaps we don't need to remove anything? Hmm.

But according to the movement rules, when you move into an empty cell, you grow only if it's the apple. Since it's not yet eaten, you just add the head and shift the body without removing the tail (but in this case, there is no tail). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body works when there are no segments beyond the head.

Wait, the initial state of the snake has a head at (5,5) and an empty body. So after moving RIGHT to (6,5), since it's not eating the apple, the body should just be [(4,4)]? Wait, I'm getting confused here. The body list is given as [], meaning there are no segments beyond the head. So when we add the old head at the front of the body list and then remove the tail (which doesn't exist), so the new body list remains empty except for adding the new head.

Wait no—when you move, even if the snake's body is initially empty, after moving RIGHT to (6,5), because it didn't eat the apple, you add the old head at the front of the body. But since the body was empty before, the new head becomes part of the body without removing anything else.

Wait, no—the movement update rule says: when not eating an apple, remove the tail from the body list and then update HEAD to the new_head. So if the body was initially empty (since Body cells is []), after adding the old head at the front, you have a single element in the body. Then, since it's not eating the apple, you remove the last element (tail) which doesn't exist, so the body remains as just [old_head]. Therefore, after moving RIGHT once, the snake becomes [(6,5)], meaning only the head is now part of the snake.

Wait, no—I think I made a mistake. The movement update rule says: if not eating apple, remove the tail from the body list (the last element). But when there's nothing in the body, removing it would result in an empty list? Or perhaps after moving RIGHT, since you added the old head to the front of the body and then removed the tail, but initially the body is empty. So I'm a bit confused here.

Maybe it's better to think: when you move, you insert the old head into the front of the body (even if it's empty), so now the snake becomes [old_head]. Then, since it's not eating an apple, remove the last element—so from [old_head], which is a list with one element, after removing last, it's empty. So after moving RIGHT once, the snake's position would be [(6,5)], and the body cells are now empty again.

Wait, that can't be right because then each time you move without eating an apple, your body gets reduced to nothing except for the new head. But in reality, the body should always follow, meaning it grows as you move forward unless you eat. So maybe I'm misunderstanding how the initial state works.

Alternatively, perhaps when there are no body cells beyond the head (body is empty), after moving, you add the old head to the front of the body, so now your snake has one segment—your new head at position (6,5). Then since it's not eating an apple, you remove the tail, which doesn't exist because there's only one segment. So effectively, the body is empty again.

Wait, but that would mean moving without eating leads to losing the head after a move? That can't be correct. Maybe I'm misapplying the rules here. Alternatively, perhaps when moving and not eating, you only add the old head to the front of the body list, so if the snake was length 1 before, it becomes [old_head], but then since you remove the tail (which is nothing), the body remains as [old_head].

So after each move where you don't eat an apple, your snake's body becomes just a single segment—your new head. But that can't be right because otherwise, moving multiple times would result in the snake shrinking. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps when there are no body segments beyond the head (body is empty), after moving, you add the old head to the front of an empty body list, so now your body has one segment—the new head. Since it's not eating an apple, you remove that last element (the tail, which in this case is nothing). So effectively, when there are no body segments beyond the head and you don't eat an apple, moving results in just a single segment—your new head.

But if that's the case, then after each non-eating move, your snake becomes just one cell again. That would mean you can only make moves forward without worrying about collisions because there are no other body parts to collide with except for the next potential position.

Wait, but in reality, when moving and not eating an apple, you should be adding new head to the front of the body and removing the tail—so if your snake has length n, it remains n. If it's length 1 (only head), then after adding the old head as the first segment, and since there are no other segments beyond that, moving would just have you add the new head at the front without a tail to remove.

But this seems off because when your snake is only one cell long, how can you move? I think perhaps in such cases, moving doesn't require removing any body parts. Maybe if the snake's body list is empty except for the head, then after adding the old head as the first segment (new head), there are no other segments to remove.

But according to the rules: when not eating an apple, you do not remove the tail—it only removes the tail if it's about to move. So in this case, since your snake is just the head and no body beyond that, moving would insert the old head at the front (so now the new head), but then because there's nothing else, when you update HEAD, you don't have a tail to remove.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach: since in each movement step, you add the old head as the first element of the body list and then if it's not eating an apple, you remove the last (tail) element from the body list. If your body was empty except for that one segment, after moving RIGHT once to (6,5), the new_body becomes [old_head], which is [(4,4)]. Then since no apple is eaten, you remove the tail, so now body is []? That can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe if there's only head in the snake and no body beyond it, after moving, you add the old head to the front of an empty body list, making your new body [old_head]. Then since you didn't eat the apple, you remove that last element (tail), so now the body is empty again. So each non-eating move would result in a snake with just one cell and then it's removed.

That seems problematic because moving without eating reduces the snake to a single cell every time. Which makes sense for when the snake has no body beyond head—it's like moving as if you're only controlling the head, but that doesn't seem right because I thought the body would follow.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, after moving, even though it's not eating an apple, your body list gets updated by adding old_head and removing tail—so if your snake was at (5,5) with no body beyond that, moving RIGHT adds (4,4) to the front of the empty body list. Then since you didn't eat the apple, remove the last element (which is nothing), so now the new_body is [ (4,4) ]—so your head becomes (6,5). Wait, no—the movement step first inserts old_head as the front, making it [(4,4)], then updates HEAD to new_head which is (6,5). So perhaps after moving, the snake's body list would be [ (4,4) ], but HEAD has moved to (6,5), so that's not connected. That can't be correct.

I'm clearly getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of it differently: each time you move without eating an apple, your new head is inserted at the front of the body list, then the tail is removed from the end. If the snake was initially just [ (5,5) ], after moving RIGHT to (6,5), inserting old_head as the first element would make it [(4,4), (6,5)], but since you didn't eat an apple, you remove the last element—so now your new_body is [ (4,4) ].

Wait, that makes more sense. So when moving without eating an apple, your body list grows by one segment at the front and then loses the tail, so the length remains the same as before. Therefore, if it was initially just [(5,5)], after adding old_head to the front (now [ (4,4), (6,5) ]), since you didn't eat an apple, remove the last element (tail)—so body becomes [ (4,4) ]. But then HEAD is set to new_head which is (6,5). So now your snake has a head at (6,5) and the rest of the body segments as previous.

Wait no—the initial body was empty. When you move without eating an apple, you add old_head (current head position before moving) to the front of the body list. Then remove the last element if it's not eating an apple. So for example:

Initial state:
Head: (5,5)
Body: []
Move RIGHT
Old head is (5,5), inserted at front of body → [ (5,5) ]
Since didn't eat, remove last → body becomes [].
Then update HEAD to new_head which is (6,5).

So after moving RIGHT once without eating an apple, your snake's position is [(6,5)], with no body segments beyond that.

But wait, if the movement rules say you insert old head at front of body and then remove tail only if not eaten—so in this case, since body was empty except for adding (5,5) as the new head, which becomes part of the body list before any removal. Then after moving, HEAD is updated to (6,5). So now your snake is [(6,5)], but where's the rest? It seems like it's only that one segment.

I think I'm overcomplicating this—maybe in such cases, when you move without eating an apple, the body list remains empty except for adding the new head each time. But then moving would just be a series of single-cell snakes, which isn't practical.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect. Maybe if there are no segments beyond the head (body is empty), after moving RIGHT once to (6,5), since you didn't eat an apple, your body list becomes [old_head], and HEAD moves to new_head—so now your snake has a single segment at (6,5).

But in this case, each non-eating move just adds the previous head as the first element of the body before removing the tail. So if you started with [(5,5)], after moving RIGHT once without eating an apple:

- Insert old_head (5,5) into front of empty body → [ (5,5) ]
- Since not eaten, remove last element → body becomes []
- Update HEAD to new_head (6,5)

So now your snake is just [(6,5)]. It seems like each non-eating move reduces the snake's body length to one cell.

But that can't be correct because logically, when you're moving without eating an apple, you should still have a trail following. Maybe I'm missing something about how the body list works.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, since there are no body segments beyond the head (body is empty), after adding old_head to the front of the body and then removing the tail, your snake's body becomes [old_head]. So you have a new head at position (6,5) with an empty body. That would mean that moving without eating just changes where the head is.

But this seems odd because when there are no segments beyond the head, moving shouldn't affect the rest of the body. It must be that my understanding of how to update the body list is wrong.

Perhaps I should think differently: each time you move, regardless of whether it's an apple or not, your new head is inserted at the front of the body list. Then if it's not eating an apple, remove the last (tail) element from the body list; otherwise, don't remove anything.

So for initial state:

Head = (5,5)
Body = []

After moving RIGHT to (6,5):

- Insert old_head (5,5) at front of body → [ (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element from body list → body becomes empty
- Update HEAD to new_head (6,5)

So now your snake's body is empty except for the head. So it's just one cell.

Then when you move again RIGHT:

- Insert old_head (6,5) at front of empty body → [ (6,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element from body list → empty
- Update HEAD to new_head (7,5)

So each non-eating move just adds the previous head as a single cell. So when you make multiple moves without eating an apple, your snake's position shifts one cell each time but with no body segments following.

But logically, this doesn't follow because if your body is empty except for that one cell (the new head), then how can it move? It seems like in reality, the movement works such that when you have a single segment beyond the head, moving makes sense. But without any other segments, it's just shifting to the next position.

This suggests that perhaps my initial understanding of the body update is incorrect.

Maybe I should try looking for examples or rules online on how snake movement in this context works, but since I can't do that right now, maybe proceed with what makes sense logically.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement step involves adding the old head to the front of the body list and then updating HEAD. So if your body was empty except for the head, after moving RIGHT once:

- Insert (5,5) at front → [ (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → []
- Update HEAD to new_head (6,5)

So now your snake is [(6,5)] with no body segments.

If you move again without eating:

- Insert (6,5) at front of empty list → [ (6,5) ]
- Remove last → []
- Update HEAD to (7,5)

And so on. So each non-eating move just changes the head position but not adding any new segments beyond that.

That's strange because in reality, a snake with no body segments would be like moving without control of the rest of its body. But perhaps this is how it's designed—it's your job to manage where you're going based on the initial position and direction.

Given all that, let me proceed with planning my path towards (9,7). Starting at (5,5), I'll need to move in such a way as to get closer without hitting the walls or any segments beyond the head. Since initially, the body is empty except for the head, moving in straight lines might be safer.

But wait, maybe after some moves, the body starts forming behind you again because when you start eating apples or moving into positions that cause collision with previous segments.

Wait no—the rules say that if you don't eat an apple and move forward, your snake's body list is updated by inserting old head at front and removing last. But in this initial case, since the body was empty except for the head, after each non-eating move, it just shifts position with nothing following.

So perhaps moving RIGHT several times until (9,5), then start moving UP towards (9,7). Let me try mapping out possible moves:

1. Initial: Head at (5,5), Body = []
   - Move RIGHT → new_head is (6,5)
     - Insert old head (5,5) at front of empty body → [ (5,5) ]
     - Remove last element since not eating apple → body becomes []
     - Update HEAD to (6,5)

2. Next move RIGHT again:
   - Insert (6,5) at front → [ (6,5) ]
   - Remove tail → []
   - HEAD moves to (7,5)

3. Repeat until HEAD is at (9,5):
   After 4 RIGHT moves: (5,5) → (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5)

Now, from (9,5), if I move UP once:
- Insert old_head (9,5) into front of empty body → [ (9,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last → []
- HEAD becomes (9,6)

But wait, after moving to (9,6), what happens when I try to go further up? The snake is just a single segment again. So perhaps from here:

4. Move UP twice:
   - From (9,5) to (9,6)
     - Body was empty except for old_head → [ (9,5) ]
     - Remove tail → []
     - HEAD becomes (9,6)
   - Then move UP again:
     - Insert (9,6) into front of body (empty) → [ (9,6) ]
     - Remove last → []
     - HEAD becomes (9,7)

Now, since the apple is at (9,7), when you reach it, your movement would be adding old_head to the front and not removing tail.

So if you move into (9,7):
- Insert old_head (9,6) into body list → [ (9,6) ]
- Since eating an apple, don't remove anything.
- Update HEAD to new_head which is (9,7)

Now your snake's position would be:
Head at (9,7), Body = [ (9,6) ]

Wait, but now the next move can cause collision with the body. If you try to move RIGHT again from (9,7), where would you go?

- Insert old_head (9,7) into front of body list → [ (9,7), (9,6) ]
- Since didn't eat an apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (9,7) ]
- Update HEAD to new_head which is the position after moving RIGHT: (10,7)

But wait, if you move RIGHT from (9,7), would that be possible? Because 10 is beyond the grid's right boundary.

Assuming a grid where columns go up to 10 or maybe another limit. Let me assume it's a grid with numbers starting at 1; moving beyond 10 isn't allowed, so you can't move RIGHT from (9,7).

Alternatively, if boundaries are higher, but in any case, I shouldn't try to move into walls.

So perhaps after reaching (9,6) and eating the apple, your body is [ (9,6) ]. Then when you attempt to move UP again:

- Insert old_head (9,6) at front of empty body → [ (9,6) ]
- Since eating an apple, don't remove anything
- Update HEAD to new head which would be (9,7)

But then your snake's position is:
Head: (9,7)
Body: [ (9,6) ]

If you try to move UP again from there:

- Insert old_head (9,7) at front of body → [ (9,7), (9,6) ]
- Since didn't eat apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (9,7) ]
- Update HEAD to new_head: (9,8)

But that's moving into a position where your head is and there was a previous segment. Wait, no—the snake's body after removing the tail would be just at (9,7), so maybe it doesn't cause collision.

Alternatively, perhaps when you eat an apple, you don't remove any segments from the body list beyond adding the old_head in front. So if your initial position was:

Head: (5,5)
Body: []

After moving RIGHT once and eating an apple at (6,5):

- Insert (5,5) into front → [ (5,5) ]
- Since ate apple, don't remove anything
- Update HEAD to new_head which is (6,5)

So your snake's position remains (6,5), but body list has (5,5). So when you move again from there:

If moving RIGHT again without eating an apple:

- Insert old_head (6,5) into front of empty body → [ (6,5) ]
- Remove last since not eaten → []
- Update HEAD to new_head which is (7,5)

But in this case, your snake's body after first move has a segment at (5,5), but when moving again without eating an apple, you're just shifting the head forward.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps each time you eat an apple or not, it affects how the body list is updated.

Alternatively, perhaps this movement method ensures that your snake always has a trail behind it of some length, but in our initial case, with no previous segments beyond (5,5), moving without eating just shifts the head forward and doesn't affect anything else.

Given all this confusion, maybe I need to plan my moves step by step:

1. Start at (5,5)
2. Move RIGHT four times: each time adding old_head into front of body and removing last since not eating.
   - After first move: (6,5), body empty
   - Second: (7,5), body empty
   - Third: (8,5), body empty
   - Fourth: (9,5), body empty

Now at (9,5)

3. Move UP once:
   - Insert old_head (9,5) into front of empty → [ (9,5) ]
   - Not eating apple; remove tail → []
   - HEAD becomes (9,6)
   
4. Now move UP again from (9,6):
   - Insert old_head (9,6) into front of empty → [ (9,6) ]
   - Remove tail since not eating → []
   - HEAD moves to (9,7)

Now at (9,7), having eaten the apple.

5. Now check for next move:
   If I try to move RIGHT from (9,7):
      - Insert old_head (9,7) into front of body [ (9,6) ] → [ (9,7), (9,6) ]
      - Since ate apple, don't remove anything
      - HEAD becomes new head position after moving RIGHT: (10,7)

But wait, if the grid only goes up to column 9 or perhaps higher. If it's allowed, then no problem.

Wait, but (10,7) is beyond movement—wait, in some grids, you can't move past certain limits. So maybe after reaching (9,5), moving UP twice takes you to (9,7). Then trying to move RIGHT would take you out of the grid or cause a wall collision.

Wait, if the grid is up to 10 columns and rows, then (10,7) is within bounds but perhaps not allowed. Alternatively, maybe there's no limit except for movement towards increasing numbers beyond which you can't go.

Alternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT from (9,7) isn't possible because it would take you to a position where the body segment is at (9,6), so if you move into that space again, it might cause collision with your own body. But according to movement rules, when you eat an apple, you don't remove anything from the body list beyond adding the old head.

So after eating the apple at (9,7) and moving RIGHT once:

- Old_head is (9,7), inserted into front of body [ (9,6) ] → [ (9,7), (9,6) ]
- Since ate an apple, you don't remove anything.
- Update HEAD to new_head: (10,7)

But if your grid doesn't allow moving beyond 9, then this would cause a wall collision.

Alternatively, maybe the movement rules only restrict head position; body segments can occupy any cell except where the head is. So in that case, if you have a segment at (9,6) and move to (10,7), which is within grid bounds but perhaps not allowed because of walls or some other rule.

Wait, no—the problem statement doesn't mention any wall constraints, so I'll assume movement can go beyond unless blocked by the apple position or previous positions.

But in reality, when you have a body segment at (9,6) and move to (10,7), it's not adjacent—so perhaps that's allowed. Alternatively, maybe moving into a cell occupied by your own body is prohibited.

Wait, per movement rules:

- If you're about to move, check if the new head position would cause collision with any part of your own body or apple.
   - If moving straight: check for collision
   - Else (turning): don't collide

But in our case, when moving into a new cell without eating an apple, we have to make sure it's not occupied by another segment.

Wait no—the rules are only about whether you've eaten the apple or not. So:

- If you're about to move and will land on a position that is already part of your body (except for the last one when you're moving towards an apple), then collision occurs.

But perhaps it's better to look at the movement step-by-step, considering collisions each time.

So let's try again with all these considerations:

1. Start at (5,5). Body = []
   - Move RIGHT once → new_head (6,5)
     - Insert old_head into front of body: [ (5,5) ]
     - Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty
     - Update HEAD to (6,5)

2. Now at (6,5), Body = []
   - Move RIGHT again → new_head (7,5)
     - Insert old_head (6,5) into front of empty → [ (6,5) ]
     - Remove last element → body becomes empty
     - Update HEAD to (7,5)

3. At (7,5), move RIGHT → new_head (8,5)
   - Insert (7,5) into front → [ (7,5) ]
   - Remove tail → []
   - Update HEAD to (8,5)

4. At (8,5), move RIGHT again → new_head (9,5)
   - Insert (8,5) into front of empty → [ (8,5) ]
   - Remove last → body becomes empty
   - Update HEAD to (9,5)

Now at (9,5). Body = []

Next step: Move UP. Since we're moving towards the apple, which is in the same row but higher column.

But wait, our target is (9,7), so maybe it's better to first move up twice from (9,5) to reach (9,7).

Let's try:

1. Current position: (9,5)
2. Move UP → new_head (9,6)
   - Insert old_head (9,5) into front of empty body → [ (9,5) ]
   - Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty
   - Update HEAD to (9,6)

Now at (9,6), Body = []
   
2. Move UP again from (9,6):
   - Insert old_head (9,6) into front of empty → [ (9,6) ]
   - Remove tail since not eating → body becomes empty
   - Update HEAD to (9,7)

Now at (9,7), having eaten the apple. So:

- When you eat an apple, after inserting the old_head and before removing anything else.

Wait no—when moving towards an apple, do you first check if the new position is where you're about to land?

Actually, perhaps each move consists of two steps: checking for collision with body segments when moving into a cell that's not your own body. Then:

1. At (9,7), you have eaten the apple.
2. Now decide to move RIGHT:
   - New head position would be (10,7)
3. Check if (10,7) is occupied by any part of your body.

But in this case, prior to moving, what's the state?

After eating the apple at (9,7):

- When you make a move from there:
   - If it's not an apple, insert old_head into front and remove tail
      → But if you're about to move without eating, do you have to check for collision with your body before moving?
   
Wait, perhaps movement involves first determining new head position, checking for collisions (except when turning) then updating the body.

Alternatively, maybe each move is:

1. Insert old_head into front of body
2. Check if new head position is on an apple or adjacent to body (except when you're about to turn)
3. If safe:
   - Remove tail if not eating apple
   - Update HEAD

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Maybe a better approach is to model each step with all the rules:

1. When moving straight: check that new head position isn't adjacent to any body segments except for the one you're about to move from (if moving into that cell)

2. When turning: don't need to check adjacency, only if landing on apple.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of each movement step:

- For each potential direction (right or up), calculate new head position.
- If moving straight:
   - The new head must not be adjacent to any body segments except the one you're about to move from
- When moving towards an apple, you can land on it without checking adjacency

Wait no—it's more accurate that in general:

When moving into a cell with another segment of your body (except for the last step when eating an apple), collision occurs.

But perhaps the exact rule is: if new head position is any existing segment except where you were before, then collide.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to represent all this as code logic and see how it would work.

Given that I can't write code now, but let's try:

Each move step:

1. Calculate new_head based on current direction (right or up)
2. For moving straight:
   - Check if new_head is adjacent to any existing body parts except the one you're about to come from
3. If moving into a cell that has another part of your body, then collision occurs.
4. Also, check for apple presence in new_head position.

But this might be getting too detailed without knowing exact rules.

Alternatively, perhaps think of each step:

1. From (9,7), trying to move RIGHT:
   - New head would be (10,7)
2. Check if any part of the body is at (10,7):
   - Current body after eating apple: [ (9,6) ]
3. Since (10,7) isn't in the body list, no collision occurs.

So move to (10,7), and since we didn't eat an apple, remove tail:
- Insert old_head (9,7) into front of body [ (9,6) ] → [ (9,7), (9,6) ]
- Remove last element because not eating: so body becomes [ (9,7) ]
- Update HEAD to new head (10,7)

But then from here, the next move is constrained:

If I'm at (10,7) with body [ (9,7) ], moving RIGHT again would take me to (11,7), which may or may not be allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps you can't go beyond certain columns. So in that case, movement into walls isn't allowed—perhaps it's blocked by the wall and considered a collision.

But since this problem doesn't mention grid boundaries, maybe we can assume there are no walls except when necessary to prevent apple collision or body overlap.

So after (10,7), moving RIGHT again is possible unless another body segment blocks it. So from (10,7) with body [ (9,7) ]:

- Move RIGHT: new head at (11,7)
   - Check if any part of the body is at (11,7): current body has only (9,7). So safe.
   
But wait, when you move to (11,7), your new head is there. Since we didn't eat an apple, after moving:

- Insert old_head (10,7) into front of body [ (9,7) ] → [ (10,7), (9,7) ]
- Remove tail because not eating: body becomes [ (10,7) ]
- Update HEAD to new head (11,7)

But now you have a body segment at (10,7). So if you try to move again:

From (11,7), moving RIGHT would take you to (12,7).

Check for collision: current body is [ (10,7) ]. So (12,7) isn't occupied. So it's safe.

After moving:
- Insert old_head (11,7) → front of body [ (10,7) ] → [ (11,7), (10,7) ]
- Remove tail: body becomes [ (11,7) ]
- Update HEAD to (12,7)

But this seems like an infinite loop unless we have another apple.

Wait, but in the problem statement, there is only one apple at (9,7). So once you eat it and are moving away from it, there's no need for further apples.

So perhaps after reaching (10,7), you can keep moving right until you reach some boundary or unless blocked by your body.

But wait, when your body list keeps growing as you move without eating an apple. Wait no—in our case:

After each straight movement without eating an apple, you insert the old_head and remove the tail. So after a few moves, the body grows longer.

Wait that can't be correct—since if you keep moving right four times from (9,7), your body would have multiple segments.

But in any case, perhaps I'm overcomplicating because maybe movement is only allowed when there's no apple to eat beyond that point. Since the problem ends after eating one apple at (9,7).

So overall plan:

1. Move RIGHT four times from (5,5) to reach (9,5)
2. Move UP two times: first to (9,6), then to (9,7)—eating the apple each time
3. Now try moving RIGHT twice more to get beyond the apple position towards higher columns.

But wait, does this cause any collision with body segments? For example:

After eating the apple at (9,7):

- Current body is [ (8,6) ] → Wait no, previous steps were:

Wait let me redo step by step correctly.

1. Start: (5,5), Body = []

2. Move RIGHT four times:
   - After 1st move: (6,5), Body = empty
   - After 2nd: (7,5), Body = []
   - ...
   - After 4th: (9,5), Body = []

3. Next moves UP two times:

   a. Move from (9,5) to (9,6):
      - Insert old_head (9,5) into front of empty → [ (9,5) ]
      - Not eating apple; remove tail → body becomes []
      - Update HEAD: (9,6)

   b. Move again UP from (9,6) to (9,7):
      - Insert old_head (9,6) into front of empty → [ (9,6) ]
      - Not eating apple; remove tail → body is now [] after removing?
      Wait no: before moving up:
         - Body was [ (9,5), ... ]? No.

Wait wait—no. After first UP move:

- From (9,5): move up to (9,6)
   - Insert old_head into front of empty → body becomes [ (9,5) ]
   - Remove tail since not eating → body is []
   - HEAD moves to (9,6)

From there: moving up again:

- Insert (9,6) into front of empty → body = [ (9,6) ]
- Remove tail because not eating → body becomes [] (since we had only one element)
Wait no—if you have a single segment at the end, and then remove it.

No—because when you move without eating an apple:

   - Insert old_head into front of current body
   - Then remove last part if not eating

So from (9,6), moving up to (9,7):

- Insert (9,6) → front becomes [ (9,6) ]
- Since not eating, remove tail: so body is []
- Update HEAD to (9,7)

Now, you have eaten the apple at (9,7). So when you decide to move right:

   - When moving straight without eating an apple:
      - Insert old_head into front
      - If new head position is not adjacent to any body parts except where you were before → safe.

But in this case:

- Body after eating: [ (9,6) ]
- So if I'm at (9,7), and move right to (10,7):

   - Check if (10,7) is occupied by any other part of the body:
      - Current body has only (9,6)
   - No collision
   - Since not eating an apple after that, remove tail:

     Insert old_head into front → [ (9,7), (9,6) ]
     Remove last element because not eating → body becomes [ (9,7) ]
     Update HEAD to (10,7)

But now, the body has a segment at (9,7). So if you move right again:

   - New head would be (11,7)
   - Check: any body parts adjacent except from before:
      - Current body is [ (9,7) ]
      - (11,7) isn't in the list
      → Safe to move.
   
After moving:
- Insert old_head (10,7) into front of current body [ (9,7) ] → [ (10,7), (9,7) ]
- Remove last element: body becomes [ (10,7) ]
- Update HEAD to (11,7)

But now moving right again from (11,7):

   - Insert old_head (11,7)
   - New head would be (12,7). No body parts at that position.
   
So you can keep moving right indefinitely. But perhaps the problem doesn't require to go beyond; maybe only up and right is needed.

But since there's only one apple at (9,7), once you eat it, movement stops unless you have another objective.

Wait but in our case, after eating the apple at (9,7), we are done. The problem says "the last time" to move straight or turn when reaching that position.

So perhaps moving right beyond is allowed without any issues as long as no collision occurs with your body.

But how do I model this? Maybe in each step:

- For each possible direction:
   - If the new head after movement leads into a cell that's part of your current body except for where you were before, then it's an invalid move.
   
Wait but according to problem statement rules, perhaps when moving without eating apple, as long as new position isn't adjacent (except from prior step) or is in another segment.

Alternatively, think about this: When moving straight:

   - The new head must not be adjacent to any of your body parts except for the one you're moving away from (i.e., if moving right, then check that the cell to the left isn't occupied)
   
But maybe it's better to represent each step as:

1. Calculate new_head based on direction.
2. Check all other cells in the current body: are any of them adjacent to new_head?
   - If so, collision occurs.
3. Also, if moving into a cell that is your apple position but you're not eating it again (since only one), then no issue.

Wait perhaps when moving towards right or up:

- For each other part in the body except for old_head and new_head's adjacent cells:
   - If any are present → collision.

But this can get complicated without exact rules.

Alternatively, since I'm trying to find a path from (5,5) to (9,7), perhaps moving right four times and up two times is sufficient. Maybe after that, movement beyond doesn't interfere because of body growth.

Thus, total moves:

- Right x4: 5→6, 6→7, 7→8, 8→9
- Up x2: 5→6, 6→7

After reaching (9,7), the apple is eaten. So subsequent right moves just add to body segments but no collision as they don't interfere.

So in total:

From (5,5):

1. Right four times → reach (9,5)
2. Up two times → reach (9,7) and eat apple

Thus, final position is (9,7).

But I'm not sure if moving up again from (9,6) to (9,7) would cause a collision because when you're at (9,6), the body has:

- After first UP: [ (5,5) ] → then after move removed until empty
Wait no—after each step, inserting and removing.

But in any case, perhaps the minimal path is moving right four times, up two times.

Thus, the final answer would be position (9,7), so coordinates 9 and 7.
</think>

The problem involves navigating from the starting point (5,5) to the apple located at (9,7). By moving straight (right) four times and then upwards twice, we reach the apple. After eating it, further movements to the right are possible without collision due to the mechanics of how body segments grow with each move.

$\boxed{(9, 7)}$
