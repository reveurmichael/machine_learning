 {
    "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
    "reasoning": "Moving 'DOWN' will take the snake one step closer to the apple. Then, moving 'RIGHT' twice will bring it directly onto the apple position. This path avoids immediate collisions and ensures the snake does not get trapped as the net number of horizontal and vertical moves match the offset between the current head position and the apple position."
