========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (5,5), and the apple is at (1,3). The current direction is "NONE", so any first move is allowed.

First, I need to figure out how to get from (5,5) to (1,3). Looking at the coordinates, the head needs to move left 4 times and down 2 times. So, the net moves should be 4 LEFTs and 2 DOWNs.

Since the current direction is NONE, the first move can't be opposite. But since it's NONE, any direction is fine for the first step. I think starting with LEFT makes sense because moving left will decrease the x-coordinate towards 1.

But wait, after moving LEFT, the snake will turn right or continue? No, in this case, we need to ensure that each move doesn't cause a collision and follows the movement rules.

Also, the snake's body is empty initially, so it can move freely without worrying about body segments blocking. Once it eats the apple, the body will grow by one segment. So after eating, I have to make sure there's at least one legal move left to avoid trapping the snake.

Let me plan the path:

1. Move LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5).
2. Then continue moving LEFT to (3,5), then to (2,5), and finally to (1,5). From here, we need to go down two steps.
3. So after reaching (1,5), the next moves should be DOWN twice to reach (1,3).

Wait, but what's the direction when moving from (5,5) to (4,5)? That's LEFT. Then, after that, can I continue moving in the same or a different direction?

But according to movement rules, we cannot reverse direction immediately. However, since the initial direction is NONE, the first move doesn't have a previous direction constraint.

Wait no: The current direction is "NONE", which means any direction is allowed for the first move. But after that, each subsequent move can't be the opposite of the current direction.

So, if I choose LEFT as the first move, then my next moves can't be RIGHT. So moving LEFT is fine, but after that, any other direction except RIGHT is allowed.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to go DOWN first and then adjust, but since we need to move left more, starting with LEFT seems efficient.

Let me outline possible moves:

1. Move LEFT (5,5) → (4,5)
2. Move LEFT again: (3,5)
3. Continue LEFT: (2,5)
4. Continue LEFT: (1,5)
5. Now, move DOWN to (1,4)
6. Then DOWN again to (1,3), which is the apple.

But wait, after each move, I need to check for collisions. Since the body starts empty, there are no segments in the way initially. But once the snake eats the apple, it grows, so I have to be careful about where the tail is moving.

Wait, let's see:

- Initial head: (5,5), body: []
1. Move LEFT: new head at (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)].
2. Next move LEFT: new head at (3,5). Body becomes [(4,5), (5,5)]. Then tail is removed because we didn't eat the apple yet. So body is now [ (4,5) ] and head is at (3,5).
Wait no: Each move adds the old head to the front of the body list.

So after first move:

Body becomes [ (5,5) ], but since it's not eating an apple, we remove the tail. Wait, no—the initial body is empty. So after moving LEFT once, the new head is (4,5). The body list was initially [], so inserting old head makes it [(5,5)], and since not eating apple, we remove the tail—but wait, there's no tail because the body is empty. So after first move, body remains as [ (5,5) ]?

Wait, let me recheck movement update rule.

Movement Update Rule:

3a. Insert old head at front of BODY.
3b. If new_head == apple, grow: don't remove tail. Else, remove last element.

So initial state:
Head is (5,5), Body is empty.

First move LEFT:
new_head = (4,5).
No collision.
Insert old head into body: body becomes [ (5,5) ].
Since new_head != apple (which is at (1,3)), so we remove the tail. But wait, the body was empty before insertion; after inserting, it's [ (5,5) ]. So when we remove tail, but there are no elements except the inserted head.

Wait, this seems confusing. Let me think:

After first move:
- Insert old_head (5,5) into body → body is now [(5,5)].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element of body. But the body only has one element. So body becomes empty again?

But that can't be right because then each move would just add and remove, leaving the body empty, which doesn't make sense for growth.

Wait, no: Let me think again. If you grow, you don't remove the tail. Otherwise, you do remove it to maintain length.

In the first step:
- New head is (4,5).
- Insert old_head into body → body becomes [ (5,5) ].
- Since new_head != apple, remove last element of body → body becomes empty again.

So after each move when not eating an apple, the body's length remains same. So initial snake has length 1 (head only). After moving once, body is empty? That doesn't make sense because the body should be behind the head.

Wait no: The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, ...]. When you move, old_head becomes BODY1, and if not growing, remove tail.

So initial state:
S = [(5,5), ... (empty)] → length 1.

After moving LEFT:
new_head = (4,5).
BODY list after inserting old head is [ (5,5) ].
Since not eating apple, we remove the last element of BODY. But body was empty before insertion? Or was it?

Wait, initial Body cells are an empty list. So after step 3a, inserting old_head makes body = [ (5,5) ]. Then step 3c: if new_head != apple, remove last element → which is (5,5). So now body is empty again.

This would imply that the snake's body is just the head moving without any segments behind it. But that doesn't make sense because each move should add a segment and possibly remove another.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me look back at the movement update rule:

3a: Insert old_head into front of BODY → so if initial Body was empty, after inserting, it's [old_head].

3b: If new_head == apple, then grow (don't remove tail).

3c: Else, remove last element.

So for first move:
- After 3a, body is [ (5,5) ].
- Since new_head != apple, we do step 3c: remove last element → which is (5,5). So body becomes empty again.

This suggests that the snake's body remains empty unless it eats an apple. That can't be right because in normal movement, each move adds a segment and removes another, keeping length same. But here, when not eating, after inserting old head into body and then removing last element, which is the old head, so effectively, nothing changes.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding step 3a: insert the old_head at front of the BODY list (which was from behind to tail). So initial Body is empty. After inserting, it's [old_head]. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element → back to empty.

This seems incorrect because then the snake never grows unless it eats an apple.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the movement update rule:

The body cells provided exclude the head and go from BODY1 (nearest the head) to BODYN (tail). So when you insert old_head into the front of the Body list, that becomes the new BODY1.

In initial state, Body is empty. After moving once, inserting old_head makes Body = [old_head], but since not eating apple, remove tail → which would be the same as the inserted element? That can't be right because then body remains empty.

This suggests a problem in understanding. Let me think differently: perhaps when you move, you always add the old head to the front of the body list, and then if you're not growing, you remove the last segment (tail). So for initial state:

1. Move LEFT:
   - new_head = (4,5).
   - Insert old_head into Body → Body becomes [ (5,5) ].
   - Since not eating apple, remove tail: which is nothing since Body was empty before insertion? Or does the tail get removed regardless?

Alternatively, perhaps when you move, you add the old head to the body list and then remove the last element unless you're growing.

So for initial state with Body = [], after moving:

- Insert old_head → Body becomes [ (5,5) ].
- Not eating apple: remove last element → Body is empty again.

Thus, the snake's body remains only the head. That can't be right because in normal movement, the body follows. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules.

Wait, perhaps the full snake S is [HEAD] + BODY list. So initial state:

S = [ (5,5) ]

After moving LEFT:
new_head = (4,5).
BODY list after inserting old head: [ (5,5) ].
Then, since not eating apple, remove last element of BODY → which was just added.

So S becomes [ (4,5) ], and Body is empty again.

This suggests that the snake's body doesn't grow unless it eats an apple. So in normal movement, the body just follows the head for one step but then disappears?

That seems odd because a snake usually leaves a trail behind.

Ah, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the rule is that when you insert the old head into the body, and if not growing, you remove the last element of the full snake S, not the body list.

Wait no, the movement update rule says:

3a: Insert old_head at front of BODY.

3b: If new_head == apple → don't remove tail.

3c: Else, remove last element (of BODY).

So initial Body is empty.

After move LEFT:
Body becomes [ (5,5) ].
Not eating apple → remove last element → Body is empty.

Thus, the body remains empty. So each time you move without eating, the body doesn't grow.

But that can't be right because then the snake's body only exists when it eats an apple.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the movement rules again:

Each time you move, regardless of whether you eat the apple or not, you add a segment (old head) to the front of the body and then remove the last segment if you didn't eat.

So for initial state with empty Body:

1. Move LEFT:
   - new_head = (4,5).
   - Insert old_head → Body becomes [ (5,5) ].
   - Not eating apple → remove last element → Body is empty again.

2. Next move LEFT:
   - new_head = (3,5).
   - Insert old_head → Body becomes [ (4,5) ].
   - Remove last → Body is empty.

So in this way, the body never grows unless it eats an apple.

But that can't be right because in reality, a snake's body follows each segment. So perhaps the rule is different: you don't remove the tail when moving, only when not growing.

Wait no, according to the rule, after inserting old_head into BODY:

3b: If new_head == apple → grow (don't remove last element).

3c: Else → remove last element.

So in normal movement, after each move, you add a segment and remove one. So length remains same unless you eat an apple, then it grows by one.

In initial state:

Body is empty.

After moving once:
- Insert old_head → Body = [ (5,5) ].
- Remove last → Body is empty.

Wait, that can't be correct because then the body never exists. I must have misunderstood the rule.

Let me read again:

Movement Update Rule 3a: Insert old head at front of BODY.

3b: If new_head == apple, don't remove tail.

3c: Else, remove last element.

So for initial state with Body empty:

After first move (LEFT):
- Insert old_head → Body = [ (5,5) ].
- Since not eating apple, remove last → Body becomes empty.

Thus, after each normal move, the body remains as it was except adding and removing one segment. But if you start with an empty body, this just toggles between having a segment and being empty.

This is confusing because in reality, the snake should have a body that follows.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying step 3a: when you insert old_head into BODY, which was initially empty, now it's [ (5,5) ]. Then, since not eating apple, remove last element → so Body becomes empty again. So after first move, the snake's body is back to being just the head.

This suggests that without eating an apple, the snake can't grow longer than one segment, which isn't correct.

Wait no: Perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the full snake S is [HEAD] + BODY. So when you insert old_head into the front of the BODY list, and then remove the last element (if not growing), the length remains same.

But initial Body is empty:

After first move:
- Insert old_head → Body = [ (5,5) ].
- Remove last → Body becomes empty.

Thus, S becomes [new_head] + [] → just head again.

This suggests that without eating an apple, the snake's body doesn't grow. But in reality, each move should add a segment to make the body longer by one and then remove one to keep length same unless growing.

I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to model it:

Let me use the initial example provided in the problem statement to understand.

Suppose the snake is at (5,5) with empty Body.

1. Move LEFT to (4,5). Now, according to movement rules:
   - Insert old_head (5,5) into front of Body → Body = [ (5,5) ].
   - Since new_head != apple, remove last element of Body → which is (5,5).
   So Body becomes empty.

Thus, after first move, the snake's position is (4,5), and Body remains empty. But that seems wrong because in reality, moving should add a segment behind.

Perhaps I'm missing something: Maybe when you insert old_head into BODY, it's added to the beginning of the list, which becomes the new BODY1, and then if not growing, you remove the last element (BODYn).

So for example:

Initial Body: empty.

After move LEFT:
   - Insert (5,5) → Body = [ (5,5) ].
   - Since not eating apple, remove last → Body is empty.

Thus, the snake's body remains just the head.

But this can't be right because it doesn't allow the body to grow unless it eats an apple.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try a different approach: Let me think about how the body grows when eating apples.

Suppose after moving to (4,5), we didn't eat any apple, so Body remains empty. Then, if in the next move we reach (3,5), same thing happens: Body adds (4,5) but then removes it. So Body is always empty unless we eat an apple.

So, if I plan a path where the snake eats the apple at (1,3), then after eating, it will grow by one segment, so Body becomes [ (0,3) ] or something? Wait no:

Wait, when you eat the apple, you don't remove the last element. So in the step where new_head == apple:

After moving to (1,3):

   - Insert old_head into Body → suppose previous position was (2,3).
   - Since new_head is apple, don't remove tail.

Thus, Body becomes [ old_head ], and now snake's length increases by one.

But before that, we have to reach the apple.

So let's plan the moves:

1. Move LEFT: (5,5) → (4,5). Body becomes empty.
2. Move LEFT: (4,5) → (3,5). Body still empty.
3. Move LEFT: (3,5) → (2,5). Empty.
4. Move LEFT: (2,5) → (1,5). Empty.
5. Now, move DOWN: (1,5) → (1,4).
6. Then move DOWN again: (1,4) → (1,3), which is the apple.

At step 6:

   - new_head = (1,3) == apple.
   - Insert old_head (1,4) into Body → Body becomes [ (1,4) ].
   - Since eating apple, don't remove tail. So Body remains [ (1,4) ].

So now, the snake's body is [ (1,4) ] and head at (1,3). So S = [ (1,3), (1,4) ].

Now, after this, the next move should ensure that the tail doesn't get into a position where it would collide with the head.

But since we have to make sure each move doesn't cause collision, which is not an issue here because the body is just one segment behind the head.

Thus, moving in this way seems safe. The sequence of moves would be:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. DOWN
6. DOWN

But wait, after step 4 (moving to (1,5)), before eating the apple, each move didn't add any body segments because they were being removed after insertion.

Only when we eat the apple at (1,3), the body grows by one segment.

So total moves needed: 6 steps.

But the problem is that in this plan, the snake's body only has one segment after eating, so it can move without collision. But what if the path requires more segments? It shouldn't be a problem here since we're just moving straight left and down.

Wait, but each time we move without eating an apple, the body doesn't grow. So in this plan, the snake will have only one segment (body) after eating the apple. That's fine because it's enough to avoid collision as long as the head doesn't move into its own body.

Thus, the moves should be:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. DOWN
6. DOWN

But wait, that's six moves. Let me check if this would cause any collisions before eating the apple.

No, because until step 6, the snake's body is empty except when it eats the apple. So no collision can occur before that.

Once at (1,3), after eating, it has one body segment behind at (1,4). Then, in the next moves, if any, we have to ensure not to move into (1,4).

But since we've reached the goal, perhaps the problem only requires moving to the apple without considering further steps.

Thus, the answer would be six moves: four LEFT and two DOWN.

Wait no, that's incorrect because each step is a single move. Let me count:

Each LEFT or DOWN is a single move. So moving from (5,5) to (1,3) requires 4 LEFT moves and 2 DOWN moves, totaling 6 moves.

But I think the problem expects the minimal number of moves, which would be the Manhattan distance: |x| + |y|. From (5,5) to (1,3): x difference is -4, y difference is -2. So total 6 moves, as above.

Thus, the sequence would be four LEFT and two DOWN in some order that leads to (1,3). The minimal path doesn't require a specific order beyond moving left enough times and down enough times.

So the answer should be six moves: any combination of four LEFTs and two DOWNs.
</think>

To reach the apple at position (1, 3) from (5, 5), you need to make a total of six moves. The minimal path involves moving left four times and down twice in any order.

**Answer:** Six moves, such as four LEFT and two DOWN actions.
