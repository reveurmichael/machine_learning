========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (9,9) with direction UP. To reach the apple at (5,8), the path requires moving left (decreasing x) and down (decreasing y). The first move LEFT avoids the top boundary and body. Subsequent DOWN and LEFT moves navigate toward (5,8), avoiding the snake's body which is concentrated vertically along x=9-3 and y=8-4. The final LEFT move reaches the apple, with safe body shifts and no collisions."
