00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Hey guys, this is Evan from EZ Origami! And today I'll be teaching you how to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,420
fold one of my original origami designs
named Stella.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,070
It's a very simple modular model and it
looks great when it's completed. This

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,570
model requires 8 square sheets of paper. Each unit is folded from one square and

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,010
I recommend using 3 inch squares to
fold the units. Using 3 inch squares

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,000
will result in a star about 4.25 inches wide. And I'm going to be

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,150
using larger paper with color on one
side and white on the other just to make

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,750
it a bit easier to follow along. And once
you've prepared your paper, then we're

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,660
going to start with our first square
with the white side up. And then we're

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,140
going to fold in half diagonally. So take
this bottom right corner and fold it up

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,730
to the top left corner. Align the corners
and the edges, then make your crease, and

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,899
then unfold. Then we're going to slightly
rotate the paper so that the crease you

13
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,620
just made is now held vertically. And now
we're going to fold over this top left

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,100
edge and align it with the crease that
we just made. So we're going to do that by

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,129
pulling this left corner over to the
right. Then we want to start at the top

16
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,399
of the model and work our way down until
the entire colored edge is aligned with

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,189
that crease just like this. Then you can
make your crease all the way across and

18
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,640
then you can turn the model over. And now we're going to fold up this bottom

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,670
corner by making a horizontal crease
that extends from this bottom right

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,810
corner here. So we're going to do that by
pulling up this bottom corner, and we

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,720
just want to continue pulling it up
until you notice this white horizontal

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,979
edge underneath. And we want our new
crease to align with that edge. But

23
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,439
before you make your crease, you also
want to make sure that the vertical

24
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,860
creases in the center of the model
align as well. Then you can make your

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,210
crease. And again we're going to fold
over this top left edge and align it

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,689
with this vertical crease. So we're going
to do that by pulling this left corner

27
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,899
over to the right. Then once again we
want to start at the top of the model

28
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,220
and work our way down until the entire
white edge is aligned with that crease.

29
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,750
And once everything is aligned, then you
can make your crease. And now we're going

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,840
to fold over this top layer along the
left edge of this white triangle

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,320
underneath. So we're going to do that by
starting in the bottom left corner and

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,530
we're just going to fold over the
colored flap like this. Then we want to

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,290
work our way up until the colored edge
is completely aligned with the white

34
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,740
edge of that triangle, and once both
edges are aligned then we're just going

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,890
to make our crease right along the
triangle's edge here. And then you can

36
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,830
unfold. And now we're going to make an
angle bisector.

37
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,010
And we're going to do that by taking the
bottom edge of this top flap here and

38
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,640
aligning it with the diagonal crease
that we just made. So we want to lift up

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,090
this top flap then we want to start at
the bottom left corner and work our way

40
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,670
up and over to the right
aligning the colored edge with that

41
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,050
crease. And once it's completely aligned,
then you can make your crease. And then

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,570
we want to fold up this colored flap
one more time along the crease

43
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,020
underneath. So we're just going to fold
this entire flap over to the left, just

44
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,610
like that along an existing crease and
once you have that then I want you to

45
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,910
remember this point here where this
colored corner intersects with this left

46
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,540
edge. Then we're going to turn the model
over. And now we're going to make a

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,450
diagonal crease that extends from the
reference point that I mentioned before.

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,440
So I've marked that point on the right
side of the model, and essentially it's

49
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,410
where this colored flap underneath ends
and aligns with the right edge of the

50
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,850
model. So what we want to do from here is make our crease pivot from that point. So

51
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,370
we're going to lift up the bottom right
corner of the model and we're going to

52
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,150
pull it over to the left. And as you're
doing this, I suggest making a small

53
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,450
pinch mark at that reference crease just
to make it easier to pivot this flap

54
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,900
along that point. Then the next step is
to align the corner that we're folding

55
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,070
over with this left edge here. So we're
going to do that by simply folding it

56
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,190
down like this, and you might have to
slightly adjust the paper to get it in

57
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,760
the correct position. And before you make
your crease, you also want to make sure

58
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,970
that this white edge is parallel with
the colored edge on the top of the model.

59
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,720
And the last step to make sure this flap
is in the correct position is to make

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,230
sure you have a 90 degree angle at the
bottom of the model here. The closer you

61
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,700
get to 90 degrees, the easier it'll be to
assemble the units. So once that flap is

62
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,750
completely aligned then you can make
your crease through all layers and your

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,620
model should look like this. If you turn
it over it should look like this on the

64
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,030
backside, and if you flip it over one
last time then this is one completed

65
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:01,980
unit. Now you must fold seven more. Once you've

66
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,970
folded all 8 units, you're going to
need 2 to start the assembly. Then look

67
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,360
at one and you'll notice that has a
large colored flap on the left side and

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,440
it also has a pocket underneath this
colored triangle here. Then again we're

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,590
going to take our second unit, and we
want to slightly rotate our first unit

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,760
like this. Then from here we want to
insert the right side of the second unit

71
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,479
inside of this colored pocket on the
first unit. Then we want to lift up both

72
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,280
units and we want to carefully bring
them together like this,

73
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,730
again making sure that the right side of
the second unit goes inside of the

74
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,970
colored pocket on the first unit. And
you'll want to slightly adjust the units

75
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,730
so that their colored flaps come to a
common point at the center of the model

76
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,090
here. You'll see that the white and
colored edges on both units will align

77
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,410
as well, and once you have this then you
can put both units back down. And from

78
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,470
here I want you to notice this colored
flap from the first unit that extends

79
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,740
past the left edge of the second unit. And all we want to do is lift up that

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,670
colored flap and we want to fold it over
to the right as far as it'll go. And your

81
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,150
crease should align with the left edge
of the second unit here. So just make

82
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,980
your crease through all layers, and now
you've connected the first two units. The

83
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,100
back side of the model should look like
this, then we're just going to flip it

84
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,910
back over, and now we're going to add a
third unit the same way. So once again

85
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,180
we're going to slightly rotate the two
units that we already connected. And from

86
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,720
here we want to insert the right side of
the third unit inside the colored pocket

87
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,930
here on the second unit. So we're going
to do that by lifting up all three units

88
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,560
and we want to slide the second and
third units together like this, again

89
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,890
inserting the right side of the third
unit inside of the second unit's pocket.

90
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,370
And you may need to slightly adjust the
units until their colored flaps come

91
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,190
to a common point at the center of the
model and until their white and

92
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,640
colored edges align as well. And once you
have that then you can put all three

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,479
units back down. Then again you'll notice
this colored flap from the second unit

94
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,470
that extends past the left edge of the
third unit, and all we want to do is lift

95
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,430
up that flap and fold it over to the
right as far as it'll go. So we're just going

96
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,669
to fold it over like this, and again your
crease should align with the left edge

97
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,479
of the second unit here. So just make
your crease through all layers, and now

98
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,110
you've connected the first three units. And now we're going to add a fourth unit

99
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,260
the same way. So again, slightly rotate
the three units that we already

100
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,890
connected, and we want to carefully slide
the fourth and third units together just

101
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,160
like we did before by inserting the
right side of the fourth unit inside of

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,280
the colored pocket on the third unit. Again, you may have to slightly adjust

103
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,580
them so that their colored flaps align
at the center of the model and until the

104
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,330
colored and white edges align on top as
well. Then you can put all four units

105
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,540
back down, and again you'll notice the
colored flap from the third unit

106
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,080
extending past the right edge of the
fourth unit. So what we want to do is

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,979
lift up that flap and fold it over to
the right as far as it'll go. And crease

108
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:33,700
sharply through all layers. And once you
have this, then you've connected four

109
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,940
units. And now we're going to add the
remaining four units the same way.

110
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,710
And as you continue adding more units
you'll start to see that they'll overlap

111
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,650
with the first one. And you just want to
continue adding units on top of the

112
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,230
other layers because it makes it a
little bit easier to lock them together.

113
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:09,629
And once you've added the last unit, then we're going to slightly rotate the model.

114
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,839
And then to connect the first and last
units together, we need to pull the first

115
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,559
unit out on top. And we're going to do
that by lifting up the model and then we

116
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:19,589
carefully want to rearrange the layers
so that this large flap from the last

117
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,189
unit is now held on the bottom of the
model. So we're carefully going to grab

118
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,279
those layers and at the same time we
want to pull the first unit out on top.

119
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,710
So we're just going to carefully
rearrange the layers like this, and once

120
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,430
the first unit is on top, it should look
something like this. Then just like we

121
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,610
did with all the other units, we want to
insert the right side of the first unit

122
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,999
inside of the colored pocket on the last
unit. So you'll see that the colored

123
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,969
pocket is slightly hidden underneath, so
we're just going to have to bring the

124
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:48,629
first unit behind like this. So just
slide the right side of the first unit

125
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:52,110
inside of that colored pocket just like
we did on the other units, so now the

126
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,139
front side of the model is symmetrical. Then we're going to turn the model over,

127
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,740
and just like we did with all the other
units, we need to lock the first and last

128
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,309
units together. So we're simply going to
mountain fold this flap along the

129
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:05,699
colored edge of the first unit here. So
you just want to take that flap and wrap

130
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,490
it around the colored edge of the first
unit just like we did on all the other

131
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,939
units. And your new crease should aligned with this colored edge on the first unit.

132
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,599
You'll now see that the backside of the
model is symmetrical, and if you turn it

133
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,219
over one last time, then your origami
Stella is complete. I hope you've enjoyed
