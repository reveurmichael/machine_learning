Let's analyze the current game state and plan a safe path to the apple at (0, 8) from the snake head at (5, 5).

Current considerations:
1. The snake has no body segments (just the head), so we only need to avoid walls
2. The head has no current direction, so we can choose any initial direction
3. The apple is 5 rows up and 3 columns to the right
4. We should prioritize moving toward the apple while staying safe

Optimal path strategy:
- First move upward to reduce the vertical distance
- Then move right toward the apple
- We'll need to make sure we don't get stuck against the top wall

Here's a sequence of 12 moves that will safely reach the apple:

1. UP
2. UP
3. UP
4. UP
5. RIGHT
6. RIGHT
7. RIGHT
8. UP
9. RIGHT
10. RIGHT
11. RIGHT
12. RIGHT

Breakdown:
- Moves 1-4: Move up to row 1 (just below the top wall)
- Moves 5-7: Start moving right while still having room to maneuver
- Move 8: Final upward move to reach the apple's row
- Moves 9-12: Move right to reach the apple's column

This path ensures we:
- Don't hit any walls
- Have enough space to maneuver
- Reach the apple in the minimum number of moves possible (12) given the grid size
- Maintain safety by not moving directly against walls until necessary

Alternative shorter path (8 moves) if we want to be more aggressive:
1. RIGHT
2. RIGHT
3. RIGHT
4. UP
5. UP
6. UP
7. UP
8. UP

But this risks getting too close to the right wall early on, so the first sequence is safer.

I recommend the first 12-move sequence for optimal safety and reliability.
