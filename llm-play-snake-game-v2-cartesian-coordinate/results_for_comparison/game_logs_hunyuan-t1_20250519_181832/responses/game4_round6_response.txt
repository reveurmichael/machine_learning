  "reasoning": "The snake must move down 6 steps to reach the apple. Starting with direction UP, the first move cannot be DOWN. Moving LEFT avoids the body and initiates a path. Subsequent DOWN moves align with the apple's y-coordinate. A single RIGHT move corrects the x-coordinate, allowing continued DOWN moves to the apple without collisions."
