========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get this snake from (1,7) to eat the apple at (1,9). The current direction is LEFT, and the body cells are given as [(2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. Hmm, let me visualize the grid first. 

So the head is at (1,7), which is on the left side of the grid near the bottom. The apple is two cells above the head, at (1,9). But wait, there's a body segment right behind the head at (2,7). So the snake is moving to the left, but how does it get up to the apple without colliding with its own body?

Looking at the initial position, the snake's body starts at (2,7) and moves down from there. The tail is at (3,4), which is pretty far down. To reach the apple at (1,9), the head needs to move up two cells. But currently, the direction is LEFT, so moving left would take it further away from the apple.

I think the first move should change direction to UP. Since the current direction is LEFT, I can't immediately reverse, but after one move, the snake can turn UP. So the first move is LEFT to (0,7), then the next move would be UP to (0,8). But wait, moving left from (1,7) to (0,7) might cause issues because of the body segments.

Wait, no, the body segments are behind the head. So moving left from (1,7) to (0,7) should be safe because there's no collision with the body yet. Then from (0,7), the next move could be UP to (0,8). But I need to check if that path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first isn't possible right now because the direction is LEFT. So perhaps the snake needs to make a U-turn to get towards the apple. Let me think about the movement rules. The snake can't reverse directions unless it's on the first move. Since the initial direction is LEFT, I can't switch to DOWN or UP immediately.

So maybe the first move is LEFT to (0,7), then the next move could be RIGHT back to (1,7). But that seems like a detour and might not get me closer. Or perhaps after moving left once, I can change direction to UP on the second move. Let me check if that's allowed.

After the first move LEFT, the snake is at (0,7), and the direction was LEFT, so the next move can be UP because it's a 90-degree turn. So from (0,7), moving UP would take the head to (0,8). Then from there, another UP move to (0,9) would get the head to the apple.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the body segments don't block the way. The snake's body is currently in positions [(2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. So as the snake moves up from (0,7) to (0,8), it should not collide with any of these body segments.

Let me outline the steps:
1. First move: LEFT from (1,7) to (0,7). This is safe because there's no collision.
2. Second move: UP from (0,7) to (0,8). Safe, as body is below.
3. Third move: UP from (0,8) to (0,9), eating the apple.

But wait, after moving up to (0,9), the snake will grow by one segment. So the body list will now include all previous segments plus the new head at (0,9). I need to ensure that the tail doesn't move in this step because it's eating the apple.

So the body length increases by one, and the tail remains at (3,4) for now. Then, on the next turn, the snake can continue moving towards the apple or adjust as needed.

I think this path is feasible. Let me make sure I'm not reversing directions improperly. The initial direction was LEFT, then I changed to UP, which is allowed because it's a 90-degree turn and not a reversal. Also, after eating the apple, there should be at least one legal move next turn, so the snake can continue moving up or adjust if necessary.

Yes, this seems like a safe path.
