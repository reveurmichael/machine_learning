```
<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where a snake is trying to reach an apple without colliding with itself or getting trapped. The snake's current position is at (7,4), and it needs to get to (7,2). Let me think through how to plan its path step by step.

First, the snake has a head at (7,4) and some body parts: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]. So right now, it's moving along the x-axis from higher x to lower x. The apple is directly below the head at (7,2). I need to get the snake there safely.

The movement rules are important here. The snake can't reverse its direction on the first move. Since it's currently facing left (based on body segments), moving right isn't allowed immediately. Also, when it eats the apple, it shouldn't block itself for the next move. So I have to make sure that after eating the apple, there's still a way for it to continue moving.

Looking at the required moves, the difference in x is 0 (7-7) and y decreases by 2 (4-2). That means we need two downward moves. But since the snake can't reverse direction immediately, I have to think about how to get those downs without hitting the body or walls.

The initial direction is "RIGHT", so the first move can't be left because of the no-reverse rule on the first step. Wait, actually, let me check: current direction is RIGHT, but according to the problem statement, it's given as one of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE (for stationary). The movement update rules say that you cannot reverse direction immediately if current direction is "NONE". But in this case, the snake is moving RIGHT. So for the first move after RIGHT, can't go LEFT? Or does no-reverse only apply when the current direction isn't NONE?

Wait, re-reading: rule 2 says: Cannot reverse direction on the first move. So if the current direction is RIGHT and you're making your first move after that, you can't go LEFT. But since this is the initial state, perhaps it's allowed to make a different move as long as it doesn't reverse.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that in the first move, from RIGHT, moving LEFT isn't allowed immediately because of no-reverse rule on the first step. So starting at (7,4), direction is RIGHT; but since we can only move in RIGHT or other directions except for immediate reverse, but since it's the initial direction, perhaps we have some flexibility.

Wait, looking back: movement example shows that after moving right to position (6,5) from (5,5), then next move cannot be left. So no-reverse applies regardless of when? Or is it only on the first step?

I think in this problem's context, since current direction is RIGHT, you can't choose LEFT as your next move because that would reverse the direction immediately.

But wait, in our case, starting at (7,4), direction is RIGHT. We need to go down towards (7,2). So how do we get there without reversing? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier about x and y directions: moving RIGHT increases x or decreases x?

Looking back at the coordinate system:

- "UP" means y+1
- "DOWN" means y-1
- "RIGHT" means x+1
- "LEFT" means x-1

So, from (7,4), moving RIGHT would take us to (8,4). Moving LEFT takes us to (6,4). Moving UP is (7,5), DOWN is (7,3).

But the snake's current direction is RIGHT. So for movement update rules, when direction is RIGHT, you can't reverse immediately if it's your first move.

Wait, I'm getting confused about no-reverse rule application.

Looking back: The second movement example shows that after choosing RIGHT, you cannot choose LEFT on next step because of immediate reversal. But the problem says "current direction is RIGHT", so perhaps moving LEFT isn't allowed as a next move.

But in our case, we need to go DOWN twice from (7,4) to reach (7,2). So perhaps we can do that without reversing. Because moving DOWN doesn't involve x changes; it's only y-1 each time.

Wait, the no-reverse rule is specifically for directions like RIGHT and LEFT or UP and DOWN? Or does it apply regardless of direction?

I think in this problem statement: "Cannot reverse": if current direction is UP, can't choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. If direction is NONE (stationary), any first move is allowed.

So since the snake's current direction is RIGHT, moving LEFT on next step isn't allowed immediately because that would be a reversal from RIGHT to LEFT.

But in our case, we don't need to reverse direction at all; just go DOWN twice. So perhaps it's okay.

Wait, but let me think about when the snake moves down:

Current head position is (7,4), moving DOWN would take us to (7,3). Is that a valid move?

We have to check if (7,3) is occupied by any part of the body except the tail. The body segments are at [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], and after moving down once, the new head would be (7,3). Since none of these positions are (7,3), it's safe.

So first move: DOWN to (7,3).

Now, next move is also in direction DOWN: from (7,3) to (7,2), which is the apple. So that should work without any issues.

But wait, let me check if after moving down once and getting closer, does the snake's body allow it?

After first movement:

- New head is at (7,3)
- The old head was at (7,4); added to the front of the body list. Body becomes [(7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]
Wait no: in step 2a of movement update rules, when moving down from (7,4) with current body segments at [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], the new_head is (7,3). Then the body is updated by inserting old head into front: so new body becomes [(7,4), 6,4,5,4,4,4], but wait, initial body was four elements. So after adding the old head as first element, it's five elements.

Then check for collision with apple:

The snake's new position is (7,3). If this cell isn't occupied by any body except possibly when tail moves, which in normal case won't happen unless we are eating the apple.

Wait, no: step 2 says to check for collisions before moving. So after inserting old head into front of the body list, the new_head is at (7,3). Now, checking if (7,3) is any of the current body positions except when tail would move (if it's an apple).

But since we aren't eating the apple yet, step 2 says to check against any body cells. The current body after adding old head becomes [(7,4),6,4,5,4,4,4]—wait, no: initial body is [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4], then inserting (7,4) makes it [(7,4), 6,4,5,4,4,4]. So the new head is at (7,3). So when we check for collision, (7,3) isn't in any of these positions except if (7,3) equals tail.

Wait, no: after adding old_head as first element, the body becomes [old_head] + current_body. Then, step 2 says to check new_head against any body cell except when it's about to move the tail. But since we're not eating apple yet, we have to see if (7,3) is in the list of old_head and current_body.

The old head was (7,4), which isn't at (7,3). So collision check: no problem. Then step 3 says:

If new_head equals apple position? The new head is (7,3), which is not equal to (7,2) yet. So proceed with movement.

Then update the body list by removing the last element if not eating apple.

So the new_body becomes [6,4,5,4,4,4]. Wait, no: initial body was [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]. After inserting old_head as first element, it's [(7,4), 6,4,5,4,4,4] (which is now five elements). Then since not eating apple, we remove the last element. So new_body becomes [6,4,5,4,4,4]. Wait no: initial body was length 4; inserting makes it length 5, then removing last gives length 4 again.

Wait, step 3 says:

If new_head == apple position (7,2), do not remove the tail. Otherwise, remove last element of body.

So in first move to (7,3):

new_head is (7,3). Apple is at (7,2); so no. Therefore, we have to remove last element of current_body, which was [(6,4),5,4,4,4]. So new_body becomes [6,4,5,4,4].

Then step 4: set head = new_head (7,3). So the snake's body is now at positions [(7,3), 6,4,5,4,4], wait no—step says:

After moving down once:

new_head becomes (7,3)
body was [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4]. After adding new_head to front: [7,3] + rest is [(7,3), 6,4,5,4,4,4], but since we're not eating apple, remove last element. So body becomes [6,4,5,4,4].

Wait no—initial body was four elements; inserting new_head makes five, then removing the tail (fourth? or fifth?) Wait step 3a: if it's normal movement, after adding new_head to front, you have a list of current_body + new_head as first. Then when not eating apple, remove last element.

So initial body is [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4]. Inserting new_head (7,4) at front makes it [(7,4), 6,4,5,4,4,4]—but wait the length was four before adding. After inserting, it's five elements: [new_head] + body.

But in step 3a, if it's not eating apple, remove last element. So from length five to four again: [(7,4),6,4,5,4]. Wait no—wait original body is [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4], so when you add new_head (7,4) as first, the list becomes [(7,4); 6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4] → length five. Then step says: if not eating apple, remove last element—so it's now [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4]. So snake is back to original body? That can't be.

Wait no—if you have the initial body as B = [b1, b2, b3, b4], then inserting new_head (NH) at front gives NH + B → length 5. Then if not eating apple, remove last element: so it's NH + first three elements of B? Wait that can't be.

No, the initial body is [(6,4);(5,4);(4,4);(3,4)]. Adding new_head (7,4) at front makes [7,4;6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4]. Then step 3 says: since not eating apple, remove last element. So body becomes [7,4;6,4;5,4;4,4].

So the new head is (7,3). So after movement:

head = (7,3)
body = [(7,4);6,4;5,4;4,4]

But that seems incorrect because from previous step.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me retrace:

1. Initial state: head at (7,4), body [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4].

2. Direction is RIGHT, first move can't be LEFT? Wait no—no-reverse applies if direction changes.

Wait perhaps the no-reverse rule just says you can't reverse direction on next step after current move.

In any case, moving down twice from (7,4) to reach apple at (7,2). Let's see:

First movement: DOWN. New head is (7,3).

Check collision: new_head not in body cells except when about to remove tail if eating apple.

Since we're not eating the apple yet, step 3 removes last element of body.

Wait no—step 3 says that if you eat the apple, keep all body parts; else, remove the tail. So after moving down:

- new_head is (7,3). Is this in any part of the body? The initial body was [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4], and we added new_head to front: so body becomes [(7,4);6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4]. But since not eating apple, step 3 says remove last element. So the body is [7,4;6,4;5,4;4,4].

Wait but (7,4) was previously head.

Then, after this movement:

- Head is at (7,3)
- Body is [(7,4);6,4;5,4;4,4]

So now, when moving again to (7,2):

Check if new_head (7,2) is in the current body or about to be removed.

Current body after adding head becomes [7,2] + rest: but wait step 3a says:

When you move, first insert new_head at front of current_body. So before moving, body was [(7,4);6,4;5,4;4,4]. Adding (7,2) as new_head makes it [7,2;7,4;6,4;5,4;4,4].

Then step 3 says: if eating apple, keep all parts. Else remove last element.

Since in this case, we are about to eat the apple at (7,2), so when moving, check whether new_head is equal to apple position:

Yes, it's apple.

Therefore, after adding new_head and inserting into front of body, you don't remove tail; you only keep all parts. So step 3 says: if you're about to eat the apple, then don't remove tail.

Thus, body becomes [7,2] + rest: but wait initial body before movement was [(7,4);6,4;5,4;4,4], so inserting new_head (7,2) gives [7,2;7,4;6,4;5,4;4,4]. Since we are eating apple, step 3 says that tail is kept—so body remains as all parts.

Wait but initial body length was four elements. After adding new_head, it's five, then since eating apple, do not remove last element (tail). So snake becomes [(7,2);7,4;6,4;5,4]. Wait no: step 3 says:

If you're about to eat the apple, after inserting new_head at front of body list, you don't need to remove tail. So in this case, since eating apple is true, we do not perform step 3a (i.e., keep all). Therefore, the body becomes [new_head] + current_body → [(7,2);7,4;6,4;5,4;4,4]. Then because it's an apple, you don't remove tail—so new body is [(7,2);7,4;6,4;5,4].

Wait no—the step says:

In step 3: If current_head == apple_position after movement:

- if yes: then do not perform the remove.

But in that case, when we are inserting to the front and before moving tail is removed (if eating), so perhaps we have to only check whether new_head equals apple. So this would make sense because at that moment you eat the apple without removing your tail—so you can keep all body segments except for any overlapping.

But in our case, since after adding new_head [(7,2)] + [6,4;5,4;4,4], and we are about to have it as head. The rest of the body is:

After movement update rules when eating apple: you don't remove tail—so all the body segments remain except perhaps if any overlap.

Wait no—it's more precise:

The process is:

1. Calculate new_head based on direction.
2. Check for collision with any current body cells (except possibly when about to eat apple).
3a. If new_head == apple position, keep all body parts; else remove tail.

So in the last step where we are moving into (7,2):

- After adding new_head [(7,2)], insert at front of body: which was [6,4;5,4;4,4]—so it becomes [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4].

But since this is the apple position, step 3a says to keep all parts.

So the new_body is:

new_head + current_body (without removing tail).

Wait no: initial body was [6,4;5,4;4,4], which had length three. After adding new_head as first element, it's four elements [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4]. Then since eating apple, we don't remove the tail (the last element). So wait, no—the body is supposed to be [new_head] + current_body.

Wait initial body was length 3? No: initial body was four elements [(6,4);(5,4);(4,4);(3,4)]. Wait in our first movement when we moved from (7,4) to (7,3), the new head was inserted into front making it [7,3; 6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4], but then since not eating apple, step 3a says remove last element—so body becomes four elements [(7,3);6,4;5,4;4,4].

Wait no—I think I'm getting mixed up in the steps.

Perhaps it's better to walk through each movement and see if any collision or tail removal happens:

First movement: move from (7,4) with direction RIGHT is not allowed because current direction was RIGHT—so you can't reverse. Wait, but earlier we were going down twice; perhaps that initial step didn't involve a reverse.

Alternatively, maybe the no-reverse rule doesn't apply if moving in same or different axis?

But let's get back on track: trying to move straight down from (7,4) to reach apple at (7,2). The first movement is DOWN—so head moves to (7,3), body becomes [(7,4);6,4;5,4;4,4].

Wait that can't be. If initial body was [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4], moving down adds new_head as (7,3) in front: so the body is now [(7,3);6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4].

But then step 3 says:

If current head equals apple position (which it doesn't yet), remove last element.

So after movement of down to (7,3):

body becomes [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4]—losing the new_head?

Wait no. The process is: calculate new_head → insert at front of current_body → check for collision and apple position.

In this case:

1. Calculate new_head as (7,3).

2. Insert into front of body [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4] → becomes [(7,3);6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4].

3. Check if this is apple position: no.

4. So remove last element (3,4) from body → resulting in [6,4;5,4;4,4].

Thus, after first movement:

head = (7,3)
body = [6,4;5,4;4,4]

Then move again to (7,2):

1. new_head is (7,2).

2. Insert into front of body: [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4].

3. Check if this equals apple position: yes.

4. So keep all parts—do not remove tail.

Thus, the new body remains [7,2] followed by rest → but since it's an apple movement, we don't perform step 3a of removing last element.

So body is now:

new_head + current_body without any removal except when necessary.

Wait no: after inserting (7,2), the body becomes [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4].

Since it's an apple position, you keep all parts—so new_body = [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4], and you don't remove tail.

So after this movement:

head is at (7,2)
body is [6,4;5,4;4,4].

Thus, no collision occurs in either steps. So that seems to work.

But let's check for any overlaps during the body parts.

Original positions were [(6,4);(5,4);(4,4);(3,4)] → after first movement and body updated:

[6,4;5,4;4,4].

Second movement: adding (7,2) to front makes [7,2;6,4;5,4;4,4]. Since it's apple position, you keep all.

But looking at this new list:

(7,2); then 6,4;5,4;4,4—no overlapping positions because each is unique. So no collision occurs during the movement except when about to eat apple.

Thus, this path seems safe.

So overall steps are:

1. Move down once: head at (7,3), body becomes [6,4;5,4;4,4].

2. Second move down: head at (7,2), body remains as new_head is apple position and you don't remove tail—so body becomes [6,4;5,4;4,4], but wait no—if we add new_head to front of current_body, which was [6,4;5,4;4,4], it's [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4].

But since it's apple position, you keep all parts—so body is now four elements: 7,2;6,4;5,4;4,4.

Wait but wait—is the initial body length three? No. Initially when moving down from (7,4) to (7,3), after step 3b:

Wait no—I think that was movement step one: head becomes (7,3). When inserted into front of current_body [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4], it's four elements. Then since not eating apple, step 3a says remove last element—so new body is [(7,3);6,4;5,4;4,4].

So after that movement:

- head: (7,3)
- body: [6,4;5,4;4,4]

Then for second movement to apple position:

new_head = (7,2)

Insert into front of current_body → [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4].

Check if new_head is apple—yes.

So you do not remove last element. So the body becomes [7,2;6,4;5,4;4,4]. But that would result in four parts for a snake of length 3 (because initial was three). No—initially, after first movement, the body had four elements? Wait no: when you moved down from (7,4) to (7,3), step 1: new_head is inserted as front. Then because not eating apple, you remove last element.

So for first movement:

- head becomes (7,3)
- body was initially [6,4;5,4;4,4;3,4] → after inserting new_head and removing tail: [(7,3);6,4;5,4;4,4]

Yes—so length is four elements.

Then moving again:

- insert (7,2) in front of [6,4;5,4;4,4], resulting in five elements. Then since apple is being eaten, you do not remove tail—it's kept as is.

So body becomes [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4].

But wait: after inserting new_head and without removing any segments (since it's an apple), the snake now has four segments:

(7,2), 6,4,5,4,4,4—no that can't be.

Wait no—the body is [(7,2);6,4;5,4;4,4].

Which are four elements. The first part is (7,2), then the rest of the snake's body as before.

So in this case:

- After second movement, head is at apple position: (7,2)
- Body parts are 6,4;5,4;4,4—so no overlaps because none of those positions are (7,2).

Thus, that seems safe.

Therefore, the answer would be moving twice in down direction, each time without reversing. So directions are [DOWN, DOWN].

But let me check if any other movement could have resulted in a collision.

Alternative approach: Maybe try to move right or left instead of straight down— but given that body parts are along (6,4),5,4; etc., moving sideways would likely result in immediate collision with the front part. So probably the only way is to go down twice without any issues.

So I think the correct directions are two downs.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position (7, 4) to an apple located at (7, 2) on a grid. The snake has specific body segments that follow it, and our goal is to move the head directly towards the apple without causing any collisions with itself or overlapping segments.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (7, 4) with its body parts extending upwards along the y-axis: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)].
2. **Movement Constraints**:
   - The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right.
   - It cannot reverse direction immediately after a movement step to avoid self-collision.
   - If the head moves towards an apple, it will not remove its tail segment; otherwise, it removes the last segment of its body.

3. **Strategy**:
   - The target position (7, 2) is directly above the initial head position along the y-axis.
   - Moving the snake downwards twice from (7,4) to reach (7,2) is a viable strategy since there are no obstacles or overlaps with body parts in this path.

### Solution Code

```python
# snake movement directions: up, down, left, right
directions = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']

def move_snake(current_head, current_body, apple_position):
    for direction in directions:
        # determine the new head position based on direction
        if direction == 'up':
            new_head = (current_head[0], current_head[1] - 1)
        elif direction == 'down':
            new_head = (current_head[0], current_head[1] + 1)
        elif direction == 'left':
            new_head = (current_head[0] - 1, current_head[1])
        else: # right
            new_head = (current_head[0] + 1, current_head[1])

        # check collision with walls or self
        if not collide(new_head, current_body):
            # insert the new head into front and remove last segment unless it's apple position
            new_body = [new_head] + current_body[:-1]
            if new_head == apple_position:
                new_body.insert(0, new_head)
            else:
                new_body = new_body[:-1]

            return (new_head, new_body)

    # no possible move found
    return None

def collide(head, body):
    x, y = head
    for segment in body:
        if segment == (x, y):
            return True
    return False

# initial position of the snake
current_head = (7,4)
current_body = [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]
apple_pos = (7, 2)

# move towards apple
result = move_snake(current_head, current_body, apple_pos)
print("Move directions:", result[1])
```

### Explanation

- **Direction Handling**: The function iterates through each possible direction to determine the next head position. Moving up decreases the y-coordinate, moving down increases it, left decreases the x-coordinate, and right increases it.
- **Collision Check**: Before moving, we check if the new head position would cause a collision with any part of the snake's body (including itself).
- **Body Update**: After determining a safe move, update the snake's body. If the move leads towards the apple, append the new head without removing any segments; otherwise, remove the last segment to maintain the body length.

This approach ensures that the snake navigates directly towards the apple without self-collisions or unnecessary body adjustments.
