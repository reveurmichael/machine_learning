========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

To solve this problem, let's first understand the current position of the snake and the target apple:

- Head position: (2, 7)
- Current direction: LEFT
- Body cells: [(4, 7), (3, 7)]
- Apple position: (2, 9)

The goal is to move from (2, 7) to (2, 9). We need to make sure we don't reverse the current direction on the first move and avoid collisions with walls or body.

Let's analyze:
1. The snake is moving LEFT, so the first move cannot be RIGHT.
2. From (2, 7), to reach (2, 9), we only need to move UP twice.

Since there are no obstacles in this path and we don't reverse direction initially, a safe path would be just moving UP twice:

```
{
  "moves": ["UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move up from (2,7) to (2,8), then again from (2,8) to (2,9). No obstacles or collisions along this path."
}
```

Let's implement this in the expected JSON format:

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move up from (2,7) to (2,8), then again from (2,8) to (2,9). No obstacles or collisions along this path."
}
```

This is the correct solution based on the constraints and current game state.
