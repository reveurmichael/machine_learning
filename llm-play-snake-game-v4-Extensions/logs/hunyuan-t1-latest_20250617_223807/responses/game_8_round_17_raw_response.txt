{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 7 units right and 4 units up to reach the apple at (9,9). The current body occupies the left edge and a horizontal line from (0,7) to (5,7), leaving the right and upper areas clear. Moving right first avoids body collisions, then moving up aligns with the apple's position. Each step checks for safe positions (within bounds and not colliding with current body segments), ensuring a continuous path."
