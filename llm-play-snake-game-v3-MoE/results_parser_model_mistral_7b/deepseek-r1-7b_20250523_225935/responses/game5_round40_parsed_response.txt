{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (8, 3) and the apple is located at (8, 2). To reach the apple, we can move UP once to get to (8, 4), but since there's a body cell there, we cannot continue moving up. Instead, we can move RIGHT to go to (9, 4). From here, we can move UP again to reach (9, 5) and finally move DOWN to reach the apple at (8, 2). However, since the objective is not to return to the starting position after eating the apple, we choose to ignore that last move."}
