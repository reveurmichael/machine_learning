<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The snake is at (5,5), and the apple is at (2,2) on a 10x10 grid. The current direction is NONE, which means any direction is allowed for the first move except reversing.

First, I need to plan a path from (5,5) to (2,2). Let's calculate the Manhattan distance. The apple is at x=2 and y=2, while the head is at x=5 and y=5. So, the snake needs to move left 3 times and down 3 times.

The required moves are:
- #LEFT - #RIGHT = 3 (since 5 > 2)
- #DOWN - #UP = 3 (since 5 > 2)

I need to make sure that after each move, the snake doesn't collide with its own body or go out of bounds. Also, I can't reverse direction on the first move since it's NONE, but any initial move is allowed.

Let me consider the possible directions:
1. The apple is southwest from the head. So moving LEFT and DOWN makes sense.
2. Starting with a LEFT to avoid immediately going towards the body or getting stuck.

Wait, wait. Wait, the snake is at (5,5), and there are no body cells mentioned in the input. So initially, the body is empty. That means the snake can move freely without worrying about collisions except when it grows after eating the apple.

But I need to plan for future steps as well because once the snake eats the apple, its length increases by 1. However, since the initial body is empty, the first moves should be straightforward.

Let me outline possible moves step by step:

1. The head starts at (5,5).
2. First move: Let's choose LEFT to (4,5). This seems safe.
3. Next, another LEFT to (3,5), then again LEFT to (2,5). Now the snake is at x=2, but y=5. We need to go down 3 times.

Wait, but from (2,5), moving DOWN would take it to (2,4), then (2,3), and finally (2,2) where the apple is. So after three LEFT moves and three DOWN moves, we can reach the apple.

But wait, when moving towards the apple, I need to ensure that each move doesn't cause a collision with the body. But initially, the body is empty, so no problem.

Wait another thing: After eating the apple, the snake's length increases by one. So after the first step, the body will have the old head (5,5), and when moving again, it'll add each new position.

But since in the initial state, the body is empty, let's think about how the movement works.

Each move:

- Compute new head.
- Check collision: if new_head is out of bounds or collides with any body cell except possibly the tail (but initially, there's no tail because the body is empty).

So for each step until eating the apple, the snake can move freely without worrying about collisions except boundaries.

But when approaching the apple, after the last move, the head will be at (2,5). Then we need to make three DOWN moves:

- From (2,5) -> (2,4)
- Then (2,3)
- Then (2,2), which is the apple.

Wait, but from (5,5), moving LEFT three times would get us to (2,5), then three DOWN to (2,2). That's a total of 6 moves: L, L, L, D, D, D.

Let me check if this path is collision-free:

1. Move 1: LEFT from (5,5) → (4,5)
   - Body after move: [ (5,5) ] (since we added old head to body)
   - Not eating apple yet, so tail removed → body becomes empty.

2. Move 2: LEFT → (3,5)
   - Add old head (4,5) to body → [ (4,5) ]
   - Tail is at (5,5), which was added in move 1 but then removed because not eating apple. Wait no, initial body is empty.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the body updates.

In each step:

After moving, new_head is computed. Then, if it's safe, update the body.

If not eating apple:
- Insert old head at front of body.
- Remove tail.

So for each move until eating the apple, the body will have one more segment, except when growing after eating.

Wait, let me see:

Initial state: S = [ (5,5) ] as head, body is empty.

Move 1: Direction LEFT
- new_head = (4,5)
- Check collision: no.
- Insert old head (5,5) into body → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail. But initial body is empty, so after adding (5,5), we have to remove the last element. Wait, but body is being updated.

Wait, in movement example:

In normal move:
a. Insert old head into front of BODY → becomes [old_head] + body
b. If not eating apple: remove tail (last element)

So for first move:

Body after step 1:
- a. insert (5,5) at front → [ (5,5) ]
- b. since new_head != apple, remove last element, which is nothing because initially body was empty. So the body becomes empty.

Wait no: initial body is empty. After inserting old head (5,5), the body is [ (5,5) ]. Then, as it's a normal move (not eating apple), we remove tail → which would be (5,5). Wait that can't be right because then body remains empty.

But that doesn't make sense because after each move, the head moves and the body follows. So when you move, the old head is added to body, but if not growing, the tail is removed.

So in first step:

- new_head = (4,5)
- insert old head (5,5) → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element (which is (5,5)), so body remains empty.
- So after move 1: head is (4,5), body is empty.

Move 2: LEFT again
- new_head = (3,5)
- check collision: no
- insert old head (4,5) into body → [ (4,5) ]
- remove tail → nothing to remove, so body remains [ (4,5) ]
- Wait, this doesn't seem right. Because after move 1, the body is empty, but when you add the new old head and then remove the tail, which was (5,5), but it's not there.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body updates work. Let me refer back to the movement update rules:

3. Update body positions:
   a. Insert the old head position at front of BODY list → becomes BODY1.
   b. If new_head == apple: grow (do not remove tail)
   c. Else, move normally: remove last element.

So after each move:

- The old head is added to the front of the body list.
- Then, if eating apple, keep the body as is; else, remove the last element (the original tail).

In initial state, body is empty.

Move 1:
- Insert old head (5,5) → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Not eating apple → remove last element → body is now empty.
So after move 1: body is empty.

Move 2:
- Direction LEFT again. New head is (4,5). Wait no: initial move was from (5,5) to (4,5), so next move would be another LEFT to (3,5).

Wait, sorry for confusion.

Let me re-express:

Start at (5,5), body is empty.

Move 1:
- new_head = (4,5)
- insert old head → [ (5,5) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element (which is none because initially empty?) Or wait, initial body is empty. So after inserting, the body is [ (5,5) ]. Then, when removing tail, it's [ ] again.

So after move 1: head is (4,5), body is empty.

Move 2:
- Direction LEFT again.
- new_head = (3,5)
- insert old head (4,5) → body becomes [ (4,5) ]
- not eating apple → remove last element → body remains empty.

Wait, that can't be right because then the snake's body is never growing unless it eats an apple. So perhaps when the body is empty and you add the old head, then remove it, which doesn't make sense for movement. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body updates work.

Alternatively, perhaps in normal moves, when the body is not growing, each new move shifts the body forward without adding a new segment. So when moving normally, each step adds the old head and removes the tail, effectively keeping the length same.

Wait no: for example, in movement example where S = [ (4,4), (4,3) ] and direction is LEFT:

- After move, body becomes [ (4,4), (4,3) ], then tail removed → [ (4,4) ]

So from two segments to one.

But when the initial body is empty, after adding old head, removing tail would leave nothing. So perhaps for the first move, the snake's body doesn't have any segments except the new added one, which is immediately removed unless growing.

This suggests that without eating apples, the body remains empty because each movement adds and removes the same segment.

Wait no, because in normal moves:

a. Insert old head → so body becomes [old_head]

b. If not apple: remove tail (last element) → which would be [old_head], then removing it leaves body as empty.

So for all non-apple moves, unless you've eaten before, the body remains empty.

Only after eating an apple does the body retain the old head segments.

Wait that's a problem because if I plan to make 6 moves without eating an apple in between, the body will remain empty. So my initial approach of moving LLLDDD would require that each move is safe as the body doesn't interfere.

But since the body remains empty until after eating the apple, then the path should be collision-free except for boundaries.

Therefore, let's plan the moves:

1. Move LEFT from (5,5) → (4,5)
2. Move LEFT to (3,5)
3. Move LEFT to (2,5)
4. Then move DOWN to (2,4)
5. DOWN to (2,3)
6. DOWN to (2,2)

At each step, since the body is empty except when we eat the apple.

But wait, after eating the apple at step 6:

- new_head = (2,2)
- insert old head (2,3) into body → [ (2,3) ]
- since it's an apple, do not remove tail. So now body has one segment: [ (2,3) ]

So no collision with the body.

Therefore, this path is safe.

But let me check each move:

Move 1: LEFT from (5,5) → (4,5). Safe, empty body.

Move 2: LEFT to (3,5). Body remains empty.

Move 3: LEFT to (2,5). Now at x=2.

Move 4: DOWN to (2,4).

Move 5: DOWN to (2,3).

Move 6: DOWN to (2,2) which is the apple. After eating, body becomes [ (2,3) ].

But then, in future moves, if any, the snake would have a body part at (2,3), so moving further down from (2,2) isn't needed here.

Therefore, the path should be safe.

Alternatively, another path could involve going DOWN first, but since both x and y need to decrease by 3, it's symmetrical. Choosing LEFT first is arbitrary, but either way works.

But wait, in some grids, moving in a certain direction might cause issues with wrap-around or similar, but here it's a straightforward grid.

Another consideration: could the snake get into a position where its next move would collide with itself before reaching the apple?

Since initially, the body is empty until after eating, no. Only after eating does the body have a segment to worry about.

Thus, the plan is:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN

So six moves: L, L, L, D, D, D.

But let me check if there's any shorter path or alternative that might be safer, but in this case, it's the most direct path.

Another thought: Could we move DOWN first? For example:

1. DOWN from (5,5) → (5,4)
2. DOWN to (5,3)
3. DOWN to (5,2)
But then we need to move LEFT three times to get to x=2.

So that would be D, D, D, L, L, L. Same number of moves.

Either way is fine, but perhaps going LEFT first is better since the apple is more towards the left.

Therefore, I think the path is valid.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at (5,5) on a 10x10 grid to an apple located at (2,2). The snake can move in four directions: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. Initially, the snake's body is empty, meaning it doesn't collide with itself except when it grows after eating the apple.

### Approach
The goal is to reach the apple at (2,2) from (5,5). The Manhattan distance calculation shows that we need to move 3 units to the LEFT and 3 units DOWN. 

1. **Calculate Required Moves**: 
   - Move LEFT three times to decrease the x-coordinate from 5 to 2.
   - Then, move DOWN three times to decrease the y-coordinate from 5 to 2.

2. **Check for Collisions**:
   - Since the snake's body is initially empty, we don't have to worry about self-collisions until after eating the apple.

3. **Plan Moves**:
   - Move LEFT three times to reach (2,5).
   - Then move DOWN three times to reach (2,2), where the apple is located.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code simulates the snake's movement towards the apple at (2,2) from (5,5)

def main():
    head = (5, 5)
    target = (2, 2)
    body = []

    # Calculate direction: need to move left 3 times and down 3 times
    directions = [('LEFT')]*3 + [('DOWN')]*3

    for move in directions:
        if move == 'LEFT':
            new_head = (head[0] - 1, head[1])
        elif move == 'RIGHT':
            new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
        elif move == 'UP':
            new_head = (head[0], head[1] - 1)
        else:  # DOWN
            new_head = (head[0], head[1] + 1)

        # Check if new_head is target (apple)
        if new_head == target:
            print("Eaten apple at:", new_head)
            body.append(head)  # Add old head to body
            head = new_head
            break

        # Update body
        body.insert(0, head)
        if len(body) > 0:  # Remove tail if not growing
            body.pop()

        # Update head position
        head = new_head

    print("Final head position:", head)
    print("Snake's body:", body)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (5,5) with an empty body.
2. **Direction Calculation**: We determine the required moves to reach the apple by calculating the difference in x and y coordinates.
3. **Movement Simulation**: For each move:
   - Calculate the new head position based on the direction.
   - If the new head position is the target (apple), update the body and break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, update the body by adding the old head to the front and removing the tail (if not growing).
4. **Output**: After reaching the apple, print the final head position and the snake's body.

This approach ensures that the snake moves efficiently towards the apple without colliding with itself until after eating the apple, at which point the body updates accordingly.

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (2, 2). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
