{"moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake should move LEFT to get closer to the apple, as there is no apple specified in the original message. After moving LEFT once, the head of the snake will be at (2, 8). Now, the snake needs to move DOWN twice to reach the apple at (2, 7. The reasoning for these moves is based on avoiding collision with the body parts by having each part follow the path of the previous part."}
