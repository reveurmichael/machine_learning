Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (4,6). Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the current state. The head is at (5,5), and the body is empty since the Body cells list is given as an empty array. That means the snake is just the head right now, so it can move freely without worrying about its own body blocking itself, except for when it starts growing after eating the apple.

The direction is currently "NONE", which means any direction is allowed on the first move. The apple is at (4,6), which is one unit to the left and one unit up from the head's current position.

Looking at the coordinates, moving LEFT once would take the head to (4,5), and then UP once would get it to (4,6). That seems straightforward. Let me check if there are any obstacles or collision risks here.

Since the body is empty right now, after moving LEFT, the body will just be [(5,5)] because we add the old head to the body, but since there's no tail to worry about yet, it shouldn't collide with anything except maybe itself. But since the body is only one segment (the old head), and the new head is at (4,5), that should be safe.

Wait, actually, after moving LEFT, the body will become [ (5,5) ] because we insert the old head into the body list. Then, if we move UP next, the new head would be (4,6). But before that, when checking for collisions after the first move (LEFT), the new head is at (4,5). The body now includes (5,5), which was the previous head. But since the snake's body segments are only from BODY1 onwards, and in this case, the body list would be [ (5,5) ] because we added the old head.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify:

When you move LEFT, the new head is at (4,5). The body was empty before, so after moving, step 3a says to insert the old head into the front of the BODY list. So the BODY becomes [ (5,5) ]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail—except there's no tail yet because the snake is only length 1. Wait, the initial body is empty, so after adding the old head, the body would be [ (5,5) ], and then since we're not eating an apple, do we remove anything? Or does the body stay as it is?

Wait, step 3c says if not growing, remove the last element of the BODY. But in this case, after moving LEFT, the old head is added to the front, making the body [ (5,5) ]. Then since we're not eating an apple (because new_head isn't at the apple yet), we have to remove the tail. But the tail was at (5,5) because that's where the head was before moving. Wait no—the snake is just the head and body segments after movement.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express:

Initial state: HEAD = (5,5), BODY = [].

After choosing LEFT:
1. New head is (4,5).
2. Check for collisions: new_head is within bounds, and since the old body was empty, no collision with any BODY segments.
3. Update body:
   a. Insert old head (5,5) at front of BODY → now BODY = [ (5,5) ].
   b. Since new_head != apple (which is at (4,6)), we remove the last element of BODY. But the BODY is only [ (5,5) ], and if we remove the tail, does that mean removing the last element? Wait, no—the tail is the last segment, which in this case would be the same as the only body segment after adding the old head.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding step 3. Let me read it again:

After computing new_head (step 2), if no collision:
3a. Insert old head into front of BODY → so BODY becomes [old_head] + current BODY.
Then, if new_head == apple: grow (don't remove tail).
Else: move normally, which is removing the last element of BODY.

But in our initial case, after moving LEFT:

BODY was empty before movement. After step 3a, it's [ (5,5) ].
Since we didn't eat an apple, step 3c applies: remove last element of BODY. But the last element is (5,5), which was just added. So now the BODY becomes empty again.

Wait no, that can't be right because then the snake would lose its body each time it moves, but since the initial body is empty, after moving once, the body remains empty except for adding and removing the old head.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of an example:

In the movement example given in the problem statement, when S = [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)], choosing LEFT results in new_head (3,4). Then step 3a: insert old head (4,4) at front → BODY becomes [ (4,4), (4,3) ]. Then since not eating apple, remove last element (BODY was [ (4,4), (4,3) ] before adding, but wait no—wait the initial S is [HEAD, BODY1], which is [ (4,4), (4,3) ]. After moving LEFT, new_head is (3,4). Then step 3a: insert old head (4,4) at front of the BODY list. So the BODY becomes [ (4,4), (4,3) ].

Then since not eating apple, remove last element → which would be (4,3), so the new body is just [ (4,4) ]. Wait no—the problem says that after inserting old head at front of BODY, if not growing, you remove the tail. So in this example, the new BODY becomes [ (4,4) ].

Wait, but in the movement example given, after moving LEFT, the resulting S is [ (3,4), (4,4) ], meaning the body has one segment at (4,4). So yes, that makes sense: after inserting old head, you have [ (4,4), (4,3) ] as the new BODY list, then remove the last element (the tail, which is (4,3)), leaving only [ (4,4) ].

So in our initial case, when the body was empty:

After moving LEFT:
- Step 1: new_head = (4,5).
- Step 2: no collision.
- Step 3a: insert old head (5,5) into front of BODY → BODY becomes [ (5,5) ].
- Since new_head != apple (we're at (4,5), apple is at (4,6)), step 3c applies: remove last element. But the last element is (5,5). Wait that can't be right because then after movement, the body would be empty again.

Wait no—that's not possible. Because when you move, the old head becomes the new BODY1, and if you don't eat an apple, you have to remove the tail. But in this case, since the snake was length 1 (only head), adding the old head as BODY1 and then removing the tail would result in the body being empty again.

Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The initial state is HEAD = (5,5), BODY = [] (empty). So after moving LEFT:

- New head is (4,5).
- Insert old head into front of BODY: so BODY becomes [ (5,5) ].
- Since new_head != apple, remove last element of BODY → which is (5,5), leaving the body as empty.

Wait that would mean that after moving once, the body is back to being empty. That can't be right because then each move would just alternate between head and empty body, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misinterpreting step 3c.

Alternatively, perhaps when you don't eat an apple, you remove the last element of the BODY after adding the new head. Wait no—the process is:

After inserting old head into the front (step 3a), if not eating, then you remove the last element (the tail). But in this case, since we started with an empty body, after step 3a, the body has [ (5,5) ]. Then removing the last element would leave it empty again.

Wait that can't be correct because that would mean the snake's body is always only one segment when moving. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe in the initial state, since the body is empty, after adding the old head as BODY1, and then not eating an apple, you don't have a tail to remove, so the body remains [ (5,5) ].

Wait no—the step says: if new_head != apple, remove last element of the BODY. So in this case, the initial BODY was empty. After inserting old head, it's [ (5,5) ]. Then you remove the last element, which is (5,5), so the body becomes empty again.

But that would mean that after each move where you don't eat an apple, your body remains empty. That seems to make sense because a snake of length 1 can only have its head and no body segments. So in this case, moving LEFT once, then UP once would be safe.

So the path would be:

Move LEFT: (4,5) → body becomes [ (5,5) ] but after removing tail (since not eating apple), body is empty again? Or does it stay as [ (5,5) ]?

Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The initial state is HEAD at (5,5), BODY is []. After moving LEFT:

- New head: (4,5)
- Insert old head into front of BODY → BODY becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Since new_head != apple (which is at (4,6)), step 3c applies: remove last element of BODY. But the body was [ (5,5) ], so removing the last element would leave it empty.

Wait that can't be right because then each move where you don't eat an apple would result in your body being empty again. So for a snake with initial length 1, moving once would make its body have one segment, but then if you move again without eating, you'd remove that segment, making the body empty.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed under the assumption that after the first move (LEFT), the body is [ (5,5) ], and the head is at (4,5). Then moving UP would take the head to (4,6), which is where the apple is.

So step-by-step:

1. Move LEFT:
   - Head: (4,5)
   - Body: [ (5,5) ] (after inserting old head)
   - Since new_head != apple, remove last element → body becomes empty.

Wait no—this would mean that after moving once without eating an apple, the body is empty again. That seems odd but perhaps correct for a snake of length 1.

But wait, when you move, the body grows by adding the old head and then, if not growing (i.e., not eating), it removes the tail to maintain the same length. Wait no—the initial length was 1 (head only). After inserting old head into the body, the body becomes [ (5,5) ] as the first segment, making the total segments now 2: head at (4,5) and body at (5,5). But since we're not growing (not eating apple), we remove the last segment (the tail, which is the old head at (5,5)), leaving us with just the new head at (4,5) and no body segments. So yes, the body remains empty after each non-growing move.

So in this case:

First move: LEFT → head at (4,5), body becomes [ (5,5) ] then remove tail → body is empty.
Second move: UP → new head at (4,6). Check if it's on the apple. Yes, so we don't process step 3c (since we grow instead).

Wait no—step 2 says if new_head == apple, you proceed to growing, not just moving.

So when you move to (4,6), which is the apple:

1. New head: (4,6)
2. Check collision: since body was empty after first move, there's nothing in the body except perhaps old positions, but I think only the current body segments are checked for collision with new_head.

Wait no—the collision check is whether new_head is in any of the existing BODY segments (excluding itself). Since after the first move, the body was emptied, so when moving to (4,6), there's nothing in the body except perhaps the previous head, but I think each step only considers the current state after movement.

Wait no—each time you move, you have a new head and updated body. So during the second move:

After first move: head at (4,5), body empty.
Second move: choose UP → new head at (4,6).

Check collision: new_head is (4,6). The current body segments are whatever was there after the first move. Wait no—the body after the first move was emptied, so when you make the second move, the body is still empty.

Wait no—let me clarify:

Each movement step:

- Current state: HEAD and BODY.
- Compute new_head based on direction.
- Check if new_head collides with any segment in current BODY (excluding itself? Or including old head that was just moved from? I think it's the current body after previous moves.

Wait no—the collision check is done against the current body segments before moving. Wait, no: step 2 says:

After computing new_head, you check if new_head is in any of the BODY segments (excluding itself, I assume). So during each move, the collision is checked based on the current body state before the move.

Wait no—step 2 comes after computing new_head but before updating the body. So when checking for collision, it's against the current body segments (from the previous state) plus any other parts of the snake except the head? Or including the old head?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: when you move, you have a new_head and an old head which is now part of the body.

So in the first move:

- Old head: (5,5)
- New head: (4,5)
- Body before movement: []
- After step 3a: insert old head into front → BODY = [ (5,5) ]
- Then, if not eating apple, remove last element → BODY becomes empty.

Wait no—if you don't eat an apple, you have to remove the last element of the body after adding the old head. So in this case:

After step 3a: BODY is [ (5,5) ]

Then, since new_head != apple (we're at (4,5)), step 3c applies: remove last element → which is (5,5), so BODY becomes empty.

So after first move, head is at (4,5), body is empty.

Second move:

- Current state: HEAD = (4,5), BODY = []
- Choose direction: UP
- Compute new_head: (4,6)
- Check collision: new_head is not in any of the current BODY segments (since they're empty), so no collision.
- Then step 3a: insert old head (4,5) into front → BODY becomes [ (4,5) ]
- Since new_head == apple (yes, because apple is at (4,6)), we don't remove anything; instead, the snake grows. So step 3b applies: do not remove last element. The body now includes the old head.

Wait no—step 3 says:

If you eat the apple (new_head == apple), then you grow by adding to your length without removing the tail. Otherwise, you move normally, which is removing the tail.

So in this case, after inserting the old head into the front of the body, since we ate the apple, we don't remove anything. So the body becomes [ (4,5) ].

Wait no—the initial body was empty before movement. After step 3a: insert old head (4,5) → BODY = [ (4,5) ]. Then, since new_head == apple (yes), we do not remove any elements; so the body remains [ (4,5) ].

So after eating the apple:

- HEAD is at (4,6)
- BODY is [ (4,5) ]

Thus, the snake's length has increased by one segment.

Now, if we were to move again, say DOWN, what would happen?

But in our case, since we've reached the apple with two moves (LEFT then UP), that should be sufficient.

So the path is:

1. LEFT → head at (4,5), body empty (after first move).
2. UP → head at (4,6) (apple eaten), body becomes [ (4,5) ].

But wait, when we moved UP, the new_head was (4,6). After step 3a: insert old head (4,5) into front of BODY → BODY = [ (4,5) ]. Since new_head is at apple, we don't remove anything. So the body is now [ (4,5) ].

Thus, after these two moves, the snake has a head at (4,6) and one body segment at (4,5), making its total length 2.

But since our goal was to reach the apple, which we've done in two moves without any collision issues.

Wait, but let me check if there's any possibility of collision during these moves.

First move: LEFT to (4,5). Body after step 3a is [ (5,5) ], then remove last element → body empty. No collision since body was empty at the time of checking.

Second move: UP from (4,5) to (4,6). At this point, before moving, the body is empty. So when computing new_head, there's no body segments to collide with, so it's safe.

Thus, the path of LEFT then UP seems valid and collision-free.

Alternatively, another possible path could be UP then LEFT, but that would require two moves as well:

1. Move UP: head from (5,5) → (5,6)
2. Then move LEFT: (4,6)

But let's see if that's safe.

First move: UP to (5,6). Since body was empty, no collision. After step 3a: insert old head (5,5) into front → BODY = [ (5,5) ]. Not eating apple (since at (5,6)), so remove last element → BODY becomes empty.

Second move: LEFT from (5,6) to (4,6). Check collision: body is still empty after first move. So no collision. Insert old head (5,6) into front of BODY → [ (5,6) ]. Then since new_head is at apple (yes), don't remove anything; body becomes [ (5,6) ].

Wait no—the apple was at (4,6). Wait no, the apple is at (4,6), right? So when moving from (5,6) to (4,6):

- New head would be at (4,6), which is where the apple is. So yes, collision with apple, but that's intentional.

Wait no—wait: if you're at (5,6) and move LEFT, your new head would be at (4,6). The apple is at (4,6), so you eat it. Thus:

After first move (UP): head at (5,6), body empty (after step 3c).

Second move: LEFT → new head at (4,6). Check collision: since body was empty before this move, no collision. Then insert old head (5,6) into front of BODY → [ (5,6) ]. Since new_head is at apple, don't remove anything; body remains [ (5,6) ].

Thus, both paths (LEFT then UP or UP then LEFT) would work, each requiring two moves.

But since the problem asks for the minimal number of moves, which is two in either case, but perhaps I can find a shorter path? Wait no—each move changes one coordinate, so from (5,5) to (4,6) requires changing x by -1 and y by +1, which would take at least two moves.

Wait wait—can I do it in a single move? No, because each move is in one direction. So minimal number of moves is two: either LEFT then UP or vice versa.

But perhaps the problem allows for any path as long as it reaches the apple without collision. So both paths are valid.

However, let me think if there's any possibility that after eating the apple, the body could cause a collision in future steps, but since we're only required to reach the apple, not to continue moving afterwards, that shouldn't matter.

Wait no—the problem likely requires the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its own body at any point during the moves. So as long as each move's new head doesn't land on a part of the current body (excluding itself), it's okay.

In our first path:

1. LEFT: head at (4,5). Body after step 3c is empty.
2. UP: head at (4,6). No collision since body was empty during this move.

Similarly for the other path.

Thus, both paths are valid.

But perhaps I can think of a more efficient way or if there's any trap here.

Wait another thought: when you eat the apple, your snake grows. So after eating, your snake has an extra segment, but in our case, since we only ate once, it's just two segments long. But for this problem, perhaps that's not relevant as long as during each move, the new head doesn't collide with existing body parts.

Wait no—when you eat the apple, your body grows, so after eating, your body includes all previous segments plus the old head. So in our first path:

After two moves (LEFT then UP), the snake's body is [ (4,5) ] and head at (4,6). Wait no—after moving LEFT, body was emptied, but when you move UP and eat the apple, the body becomes [ (4,5) ].

Wait no: Let me retrace:

First move: LEFT.

- Start: HEAD=(5,5), BODY=[]

- Move LEFT → new_head=(4,5)

- Check collision: since BODY is empty, no collision.

- Insert old head into BODY → BODY=[(5,5)]

- Since not eating apple (apple was at (4,6)), remove last element of BODY → BODY becomes empty.

So after first move: HEAD=(4,5), BODY=[]

Second move: UP.

- Start: HEAD=(4,5), BODY=[]

- Move UP → new_head=(4,6)

- Check collision: since BODY is empty, no collision.

- Insert old head (4,5) into BODY → BODY=[(4,5)]

- Since new_head is at apple, don't remove anything. So after this move:

  HEAD=(4,6), BODY=[(4,5)]

Thus, the body now has one segment at (4,5), and the head is at (4,6). There's no collision because the new head isn't part of the body yet; only the old segments are in the body.

Wait no—the new head is added to the front, but during movement, you don't check collision with the new head itself. You only check if the new head is on any existing body segment (excluding itself). So when moving to (4,6), the body was empty before the move, so no collision.

Thus, both paths are valid and safe.

So the minimal number of moves is two: either LEFT then UP or UP then LEFT.

But perhaps the problem expects a specific path, but since it's not specified, any correct path would work. So I can choose one, say, LEFT then UP.

Wait no—the problem says "You will be given a grid...", but in this case, the initial position is (5,5), and the apple is at (4,6). Wait wait, no—wait: in grids, sometimes coordinates are (row, column) or (x,y). But without knowing the exact layout, perhaps it's better to assume that moving LEFT decreases x by 1, RIGHT increases x by 1, UP increases y by 1, DOWN decreases y by 1.

Wait wait no—actually, in grid terms, often rows are y and columns are x. So moving UP would increase y by 1, moving LEFT would decrease x by 1.

So initial position is (5,5). Apple at (4,6).

Thus:

- To get from (5,5) to (4,6), you can move LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT.

Wait no—coordinates: if initial is (x=5,y=5), moving LEFT would take x to 4, y remains 5. Then moving UP takes y to 6. So that's one path.

Alternatively, moving UP first: y becomes 6, then LEFT: x becomes 4. Either way, two moves.

Thus, the answer is two moves, either order.

But perhaps in the problem statement, the minimal number of steps is expected, which is two.

Wait but looking back at the original problem (if I had one), it might specify whether to provide the path or just the number of steps. But since the user hasn't provided that context, and this is a simulated thought process, perhaps I should conclude with the minimal number of moves being two.

But wait—no, wait: in the initial setup, the snake's head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (4,6). So to get there, you can move LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT. Either way, it's two moves.

Thus, the minimal number of moves required is two.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves a snake must make on a grid to reach an apple without colliding with its own body. The snake starts at position (5,5) and the apple is located at (4,6).

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake can move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. Each move changes the snake's head position by one unit in the chosen direction. The goal is to reach the apple at (4,6) without the new head position colliding with any part of the snake's body.

2. **Movement Strategy**: Since the snake starts at (5,5), we need to determine the shortest path to (4,6). The minimal number of moves required will be two because each move changes one coordinate, and both the x and y coordinates need to change by one unit each.

3. **Path Options**: There are two possible paths:
   - Move left (decreasing the x-coordinate) followed by moving up (increasing the y-coordinate).
   - Move up (increasing the y-coordinate) followed by moving left (decreasing the x-coordinate).

Both paths ensure that the snake reaches the apple in two moves without colliding with its body.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code simulates the minimal path for the snake to reach the apple

# Initial position of the snake's head
head = (5, 5)
# Target position of the apple
target = (4, 6)

# Function to move the snake in a given direction and check for collisions
def move_snake(current_head, direction):
    x, y = current_head
    if direction == 'left':
        new_head = (x - 1, y)
    elif direction == 'right':
        new_head = (x + 1, y)
    elif direction == 'up':
        new_head = (x, y + 1)
    else:  # down
        new_head = (x, y - 1)
    return new_head

# Simulate the moves
# First move left
head_after_first_move = move_snake(head, 'left')  # (4,5)

# Second move up
final_head = move_snake(head_after_first_move, 'up')  # (4,6)

print(f"Snake's head after two moves: {final_head}")
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (5,5). The target apple is located at (4,6).
2. **First Move**: Moving left from (5,5) takes the snake to (4,5). No collision occurs as there are no body segments except the head.
3. **Second Move**: Moving up from (4,5) takes the snake to (4,6), where the apple is located. Again, no collision occurs because the body was emptied after the first move.

This approach ensures that the snake reaches the apple in the minimal number of moves without any self-collisions.
