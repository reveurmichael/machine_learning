{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,4) with a body segment at (5,5) and needs to reach (0,0). Moving LEFT five times aligns the head with the apple's x-coordinate (0), then moving DOWN four times aligns with the apple's y-coordinate (0). Each move avoids collisions with the body (which remains at (5,4) until the final steps) and stays within grid bounds. After reaching the apple, a RIGHT move is available to avoid trapping."
