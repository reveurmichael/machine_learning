========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (1,4) with a body blocking direct right/down paths. Moving DOWN first avoids body collisions and aligns with the apple's y=0 target. Subsequent RIGHT moves navigate around the body's horizontal segment, then continued RIGHT to reach x=5. Finally, DOWN moves close the y-distance to the apple. Each step checks for body collisions and ensures safe progression toward the apple, with a legal move available after eating."
