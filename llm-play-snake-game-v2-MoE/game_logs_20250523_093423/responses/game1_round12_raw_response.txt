========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>We are asked: "You are an AI agent controlling a snake in classic Snake game on a 10x10 grid. Coordinates range from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. We are given:

- Head position: (5,4). Current direction: UP. Body cells: [(5,3)].
- Apple position: (1,7).

We have movement rules. Movement vector definitions:
* "UP": (0, 1)
* "DOWN": (0, -1)
* "LEFT": (-1, 0)
* "RIGHT": (1, 0)

Constraints:
1. Valid directions: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT".
2. The snake cannot reverse direction. If current direction is UP, then cannot move DOWN next.
3. Snake dies if collides with body or moves out-of-bound.

Snake update rules:
- After each move, the head becomes new coordinate (head + vector of chosen direction)
- The old head becomes a body segment. Tail removed unless apple eaten: tail remains unchanged when apple is eaten.
- If snake eats apple then score increases and snake grows by one additional segment that is not removed.

We must plan safe path for head to reach the apple at (1,7) from current state with head position (5,4). We have body cell at (5,3), meaning that snake's body occupies positions: (5,4) is head; then next segment is (5,3). But note if we move, our old head becomes body cell. So initial board: snake cells:
Head: (5,4)
Body: (5,3)

We need to plan safe path to apple at (1,7). We have some extra constraint: The number of LEFT moves minus RIGHT moves must equal 4, and the number of UP moves minus DOWN moves equals 3. Specifically because x difference is (5->1) so required left moves - right moves = 4 i.e., if we move left more than right by exactly 4 units.
Wait careful: In final position check instructions: 
* "x1 ≤ x2 → RIGHTs - LEFTs = x2 - x1"
Actually re-read instructions:
"Final Position Check:

Make sure the total number of LEFT/RIGHT and UP/DOWN moves matches the apple's offset:
From (5,4) to (1,7):

  * x1 <= x2 → RIGHTs - LEFTs = x2 - x1
  * x1 > x2 → LEFTs - RIGHTs = x1 - x2
  * y1 ≤ y2 → UPs - DOWNs = y2 - y1
  * y1 > y2 → DOWNs - UPs = y1 - y2

→ In your case: the number of LEFT moves, minus the number of RIGHT moves, should be equal to 4 (= 5 - 1), and the number of UP moves, minus, the number of DOWN moves, should be equal to 3 (= 7 - 4)

Wait, check logic: x difference is (5 - 1) = 4. But they said "the number of LEFT moves minus the number of RIGHT moves equals 4". Wait, but if we want to move left overall, then the net displacement in x would be (number_of_LEFT - number_of_RIGHT). That value should equal (target_x - initial_x), which is 1-5 = -4. But note careful: They said "the number of LEFT moves minus RIGHT moves should equal 4" but if we want to move left, then it's actually: (Lefts) - (Rights) equals negative? Let me recalc:
We want displacement in x from initial position 5 to target position 1. That means overall x displacement is (-4). But our given rule says "x1 > x2 → LEFTs - RIGHTs = x1 - x2", which yields lefts-right = (5-1) = 4, so that's a positive number if we count moves? Wait careful:
Maybe they intended the following: If starting x is greater than target x then net horizontal displacement must be negative. But they said "the number of LEFT moves minus RIGHT moves equals 4". That doesn't match because left moves - right moves = (1-5) should equal -4 if we consider sign convention? Let's re-read the text exactly:

"Final POSITION CHECK:
Make sure total number of LEFT/RIGHT and UP/DOWN moves matches apple offset:
From (5,4) to (1,7):
  * x1 ≤ x2 → RIGHTs - LEFTs = x2 - x1
  * x1 > x2 → LEFTs - RIGHTs = x1 - x2
  * y1 ≤ y2 → UPs - DOWNs = y2 - y1
  * y1 > y2 → DOWNs - UPs = y1 - y2 
→ In your case: the number of LEFT moves, minus, the number of RIGHT moves, should be equal to 4 (= 5 - 1), and the number of UP moves, minus, the number of DOWN moves, should be equal to 3 (= 7 - 4)"

Wait then check arithmetic:
If x1 > x2 (i.e. 5 > 1) then left moves - right moves equals (x1 - x2) which is 5-1 =4. But note that if we consider the displacement, it should be left moves minus right moves is positive if left moves are more than right moves. But here, since target position is at a lower x coordinate, you need to move left net. So actually, in our planning we want "left moves" and possibly no right moves. The condition is that lefts - rights = 4. Similarly for vertical: y1 <= y2 then up moves - down moves equals (7-4)=3.

So the moves must have at least 4 left moves net, but it could be like 4 left moves or some combination of extra moves if we add both directions? But the instruction "should be equal to" means final difference is exactly that value. In a path planning solution, you might include additional moves (like detours) as long as final differences satisfy these conditions.

We must plan safe route: We need to get from (5,4) to apple at (1,7). The grid is 10x10. The snake has initial body cell at (5,3). And we cannot reverse direction immediately if current is UP, so first move can't be DOWN.

Let's analyze potential safe paths:

We want a path that avoids collisions with our own body. Our body currently is at (5,4) head and (5,3) behind. We have apple at (1,7). Let me list coordinates:
- Head: (5,4)
- Body segment: (5,3)

Coordinates of apple: (1,7).

We want to plan a sequence of moves that gets to the apple without colliding with snake's own body segments (which shift one cell forward each move) and also without leaving board boundaries. Also after eating apple we need to ensure there is at least one legal move afterwards? That constraint "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." means that after moving into apple position, our new snake configuration (with apple eaten, so tail remains) must not trap us. But for planning a safe path to reach apple, we need to check if our subsequent moves are possible if we become longer? But the problem statement doesn't require us to plan further than reaching apple? It says "Plan a safe path for the head to reach the apple", but also "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." So perhaps we need to ensure that when the snake eats the apple (which means tail does not move) and body becomes longer by one segment. But planning just the moves to get to the apple might assume that after reaching apple, there is still a safe state with at least one additional move? But how do we check for trap conditions in this problem given limited time?

We can attempt a path manually:
- Current head (5,4), direction: UP currently.
Our body: segment behind head: (5,3). Let's denote snake positions after each move. We need to plan sequence that yields apple consumption at (1,7).

Let's examine possible candidate moves:

Since we want to get from x=5 to x=1, we eventually must move left 4 times net and up 3 times net.

The simplest Manhattan path if no obstacles: The difference in coordinates is (-4, +3). But we have constraint: cannot reverse direction immediately. Current direction is UP. So initial move can't be DOWN. We also want to avoid collisions with our own body segments.
Let's check what's behind snake: current head (5,4) and then its next segment will be (5,3), but note if I go up from (5,4) the new head becomes (5,5). And my previous head becomes a body cell. But that might conflict with apple? Not sure.
Let's try to plan: We want to eventually get to x=1 and y=7.

We must check safe path. Let me consider potential moves:

Option 1: A straightforward Manhattan path is: first move (maybe left) then up, etc. But careful with direction reversal: if you're going UP initially then can't go down immediately.
Let's attempt a candidate sequence: Starting at head = (5,4), current direction UP.
We want to get eventually to apple at (1,7). Let me see potential moves:

Maybe we try: first move LEFT? But can we move left from (5,4)? That yields new head = (4,4) if we go left. Is that safe? Body is currently at (5,3), so after making a move, snake's body will update: old head becomes (5,4) becomes part of body. Let me simulate:
Move1: Left from (5,4) to (4,4). New snake positions become: Head: (4,4); Body: previous head (5,4); tail removed normally because no apple eaten so far. And the original body cell at (5,3) becomes second segment.
But wait, careful: Actually initial snake is head (5,4), then body (5,3). After move left:
- New head: (4,4)
- Body now: old head becomes (5,4), then (5,3) remains. So snake occupies (4,4), (5,4), (5,3). No collisions because those are distinct coordinates.
So that is safe.

Now new direction: Now if we continue from (4,4) what should be next? We want to eventually reach apple at (1,7). Our net displacement required is now from (4,4): difference to apple (1,7) = (-3, +3). So if we can plan a Manhattan route from (4,4), then one possibility: move left 3 times and up 3 times in some order. But need to be careful with snake body positions and collisions.

Let me try sequence:
From (4,4): possible moves: We must avoid moving RIGHT immediately because that would reverse direction? Actually rule "cannot reverse" means cannot do opposite of current direction. Current direction is now left? Wait, but our move 1 was LEFT from (5,4). So new current direction becomes LEFT. So then we are not allowed to go RIGHT in the next immediate step if it's reversing.

Wait check: The rule says "if going UP, cannot move DOWN". But also if moving left, can't move right? Yes rule 2: The snake cannot reverse its direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). So for LEFT, the opposite would be RIGHT. So we cannot go RIGHT immediately after a LEFT move.

So from (4,4), allowed moves are not RIGHT because that would reverse left.
We want to eventually get apple (1,7) which is up-left direction relative to (4,4). So perhaps next move: Up? Let's simulate:
Move2: From (4,4) if we go UP, new head = (4,5).
Then snake becomes: New head: (4,5); body becomes previous head (4,4), then (5,4), then (5,3). Check for collisions: They are distinct.
Now current direction is now UP. And we've used one up move.

So state after two moves:
Head = (4,5)
Body positions in order: [ (4,5) head, (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ].
Our apple is at (1,7). Now displacement from current head to apple = (-3, +2) because apple (1,7) minus (4,5)=(-3,2).

We need net left moves 3 and up moves 2 more. But must also avoid reversing direction constraint: Current direction now UP. So cannot do DOWN move next.
Let's consider next:
From (4,5), possible moves: left or up or maybe right? Right is allowed if it doesn't reverse? But current direction is UP, so we can go RIGHT because that's not opposite of UP. But going right would increase x coordinate which we need to reduce eventually. So probably not.
I consider next move: from (4,5), perhaps left again, or up? Let me check:
If I do Left now, new head = (3,5).
Simulate:
Move3: LEFT from (4,5) -> New head: (3,5)
Snake becomes: Head=(3,5); then body becomes (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3). That is safe.
Current direction now becomes LEFT.
Displacement to apple = (1,7) - (3,5)= (-2, +2).
Now we need two left moves net and two up moves net.
From current position (3,5), allowed moves: not RIGHT because that would reverse left? Actually current direction is left. So cannot move right immediately.
So next possible moves: either up or left again, maybe up if needed eventually.

Let's try:
Move4: from (3,5) go Up to (3,6).
Simulate:
New head = (3,6)
Snake becomes: Head=(3,6); body becomes (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3). Check collisions? They are distinct.
Current direction becomes UP.
Displacement from new head to apple: (1,7) - (3,6)= (-2, +1).
So now required net: two left moves and one up move.
Now current direction is UP so cannot do down. We can go left or up or possibly right but that would be non-optimal.

From (3,6), next:
Move5: from (3,6) choose Left to get (2,6).
Simulate:
New head = (2,6)
Snake becomes: Head=(2,6); body becomes (3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3). Safe.
Current direction now becomes LEFT.
Displacement from apple: (1,7) - (2,6)= (-1, +1).
So required net moves: one left move and one up move.

Now current direction is LEFT so cannot go right. So next possible:
Move6: Option: Up? Let's try Up:
From (2,6), if we go UP, new head = (2,7)
Simulate:
New head = (2,7); body becomes previous head (2,6), then chain etc.
So state after move6: Head=(2,7); displacement from apple: (1,7) - (2,7)= (-1, 0). So now required net: one left move net (because difference in x is still -1 but no vertical difference)
Current direction becomes UP.

From current position (2,7), allowed moves: not DOWN. Options: left or up.
We need to get to apple at (1,7) which is exactly one cell to the left from (2,7). So:
Move7: from (2,7) go LEFT? But careful: current direction is UP so going left is allowed because it's not reverse of UP. So move7: Left yields new head = (1,7).
Simulate:
New head becomes apple cell.
Snake becomes: Head=(1,7); body now becomes previous head (2,7), then the chain from before. And since we are consuming apple, tail remains? But that is fine as long as there's at least one legal move afterwards.

We must check after reaching apple if there's a trap condition? Let's simulate positions after move7:
At move7 when new head becomes (1,7), snake body chain: The last move was left from (2,7) to (1,7). So the snake segments before that were: (2,7), (2,6)? Wait need careful simulation:

Let's simulate full snake positions at each step with order maybe:
Initial: head = (5,4); body = [(5,4)? Actually initial configuration is not given as chain order. But we assume the tail was removed? Let me simulate properly:

We start with snake positions: We have head = (5,4), then next segment = (5,3). I'll denote snake segments in order from head to tail:
Step0: [(5,4), (5,3)].
After move1: if we go LEFT, new head becomes (4,4), and old head becomes body second element. So snake becomes: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ].

Move2: from (4,4) UP to (4,5). Then snake becomes: new head = (4,5); then previous head (4,4), then (5,4), then (5,3).
So snake positions become: [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ].
Move3: from (4,5) LEFT to (3,5). Then snake becomes: new head = (3,5); body = [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)].
Positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ].
Move4: from (3,5) UP to (3,6). Then snake becomes: new head = (3,6); body becomes previous head (3,5), then chain. So now: [ (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ].
Move5: from (3,6) LEFT to (2,6). New snake becomes: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ].
Move6: from (2,6) UP to (2,7). New snake becomes: [ (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ].
Move7: from (2,7) LEFT to (1,7). New snake becomes: head = (1,7); body becomes previous head chain: [ (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) ].
Now apple is eaten so tail remains. But then we need to check if after move7 there's at least one legal move.
After eating apple the snake becomes longer by one segment compared to what it would normally be. But we should consider that now the snake has 9 segments. Is (1,7) a trap? Let's see: The snake occupies coordinates:
(1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3).
Now the board is 10x10. Is there any move from head? But check: what moves are available from new head at (1,7) if we want to avoid collisions immediately?
We must ensure that after consuming apple, the snake can still make one legal move.

Let's list potential moves from (1,7). The possible moves are:
- Up: (1,8)
- Down: (1,6)? But careful: is (1,6) occupied? Let's check snake segments: Do we have (1,6) in our snake? No. So (1,6) might be free.
- Left: (0,7): But 0,7 is off board because x=0 is outside if indexing from 1 to 10 or maybe the board coordinates are 0-indexed? Usually grid is 10x10 with indices 0 through 9. The problem statement doesn't specify coordinate system but likely we consider boundaries as min=0 and max=9 if zero-indexed. But could be 1-indexed from (1,1) to (10,10). Actually "10x10" typically means coordinates from 1 to 10 or 0 to 9? Let's assume it's a board where valid x are 0..9 and y are 0..9 if using programming conventions. But our moves like (2,7) etc. In that case then (0,7) is still inside because 0 is valid. So left from (1,7) gives (0,7) which might be free.
- Right: (2,7) but snake occupies (2,7) as second segment in the chain now.

So available moves seem to exist. However, we must also check if any move would cause collision immediately with our body? Let's simulate next state for each possibility quickly:
For move after move7 (if head is at (1,7)):
Possible moves: Up -> (1,8): Check collisions with snake body: none likely because snake segments are: row 2,3,4, etc. So that seems valid.
Down -> (1,6): Check collision? None of our segments are at (1,6) I think.
Left -> (0,7): free as long as not occupied by snake.
Right is blocked.

So after apple consumption, there is at least one move available, so condition satisfied.

Now check collisions along the route:
We already simulated moves and did not have any self-collisions. However, we need to double-check potential collisions if new head lands on a body segment that might be moving into place.
Let's simulate each step carefully:

Step 0: Snake positions: Head (5,4), Body (5,3).

Move1 (Left): 
- Check move validity: From (5,4) going left goes to (4,4). Is that occupied by snake? Currently snake occupies (5,4) and (5,3) but not (4,4). So okay.
After move:
Snake becomes [Head: (4,4), Body: [(5,4), (5,3)]]. Order: head then previous head, etc. But if we consider them as positions on board, it's fine.

Move2 (Up from (4,4)):
- New position would be (4,5). Check occupancy of snake: The snake occupies (4,4) and (5,4), (5,3). Not (4,5). So okay.
After move:
Snake becomes [Head: (4,5), then (4,4), then (5,4), then (5,3)].

Move3 (Left from (4,5)):
- New position would be (3,5). Check occupancy: snake occupies (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) none of which is (3,5). So okay.
After move:
Snake becomes [Head: (3,5); then (4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].

Move4 (Up from (3,5)):
- New position would be (3,6). Check occupancy: snake occupies (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) none of which is (3,6). So okay.
After move:
Snake becomes [Head: (3,6); then (3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].

Move5 (Left from (3,6)):
- New position would be (2,6). Check occupancy: snake occupies (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) none is (2,6). So okay.
After move:
Snake becomes [Head: (2,6); then (3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].

Move6 (Up from (2,6)):
- New position would be (2,7). Check occupancy: snake occupies (2,6), (3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3) none is (2,7). So okay.
After move:
Snake becomes [Head: (2,7); then (2,6),(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].

Move7 (Left from (2,7)):
- New position would be (1,7) which is the apple cell.
Check occupancy: snake occupies (2,7), (2,6), etc. Not (1,7). So okay.
After move:
Snake becomes [Head: (1,7); then (2,7),(2,6),(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].

So the path is valid with 7 moves. The snake's head final position is (1,7) and apple eaten.

Now count steps: It took 7 moves from initial configuration to reach the apple cell.
But wait, let me check if there is any shorter possibility? Let's try to see if a direct diagonal might be possible but snake can only move in cardinal directions. So minimal Manhattan distance between (5,4) and (1,7) is |5-1| + |4-7|= 4+3=7 moves if it were unobstructed by body self-collision constraints or needing to avoid hitting its own tail. But here the snake's body might cause collisions if the path is not planned properly.

We need to check if a direct Manhattan route exists: The Manhattan distance is 7, so minimum steps would be 7 if there was no constraint of self-collision. But wait, our snake is not on the optimal Manhattan path? Let's see possible Manhattan paths:
One Manhattan path from (5,4) to (1,7) could be: Left, Left, Left, Left, Up, Up, Up. That would require 4 left moves and 3 up moves in some order. But can we do that without colliding with the snake body? Let's simulate a candidate Manhattan path: e.g., sequence: L, L, U, L, U, U, U.
Starting at (5,4) with tail (5,3).

Sequence:
Start: head (5,4), tail (5,3).
Move1: L -> new head becomes (4,4). Body now: [(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Move2: L -> from (4,4): new head = (3,4). But check occupancy: snake occupies (4,4), (5,4), (5,3). So (3,4) is free. Then snake becomes [head: (3,4); then (4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Move3: U -> from (3,4): new head = (3,5). Check occupancy: snake occupies (3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3). Free. Now snake becomes [head: (3,5); then (3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Move4: L -> from (3,5): new head = (2,5). Check occupancy: snake occupies (3,5),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3), free. Now snake becomes [head:(2,5); then (3,5),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Move5: U -> from (2,5): new head = (2,6). Check occupancy: snake occupies (2,5),(3,5),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3), free. Now snake becomes [head:(2,6); then chain].
We need 2 more Up moves.
Move6: U -> from (2,6): new head = (2,7). Check occupancy: snake occupies (2,6),(2,5),(3,5),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3) free. Now snake becomes [head:(2,7); chain].
Move7: U -> from (2,7): new head = (2,8). That would finish Manhattan distance of 1 left remaining? But wait, we need to reach x=1 not x=2. So then the sequence doesn't match target coordinates.
We need total left moves count equals 4 and up moves equals 3. The sum is 7 moves. But our candidate path "L, L, U, L, U, U, U" from (5,4) would yield:
After move1: (4,4)
After move2: (3,4)
After move3: (3,5)
After move4: (2,5)
After move5: (2,6)
After move6: (2,7)
After move7: (2,8) which is not the target because x coordinate remains 2.
We need to get from x=5 to x=1, so we need 4 left moves. So maybe try: L, U, L, U, L, U, L might be a candidate:
Let's simulate that:
Start at (5,4), tail (5,3).
Move1: L -> new head = (4,4). Body becomes [(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Move2: U -> from (4,4): new head = (4,5). Check occupancy: snake occupies (4,4),(5,4),(5,3), free. Now snake becomes [head:(4,5); chain].
Move3: L -> from (4,5): new head = (3,5). Occupancy: snake has (4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3) free.
Now snake becomes [head:(3,5); chain].
Move4: U -> from (3,5): new head = (3,6). Check occupancy: snake occupies (3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3), free.
Now snake becomes [head:(3,6); chain].
Move5: L -> from (3,6): new head = (2,6). Occupancy check: snake occupies (3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3) free.
Snake becomes [head:(2,6); chain].
Move6: U -> from (2,6): new head = (2,7). Check occupancy: snake occupies (2,6),(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3), free.
Snake becomes [head:(2,7); chain].
Move7: L -> from (2,7): new head = (1,7). Check occupancy: snake occupies (2,7),(2,6),(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3), free.
Snake becomes [head:(1,7); chain].
That yields a valid path in 7 moves! And it is exactly Manhattan distance. So that's optimal.

Let me check the sequence: L, U, L, U, L, U, L from (5,4). Let's re-check each move:
Initial snake positions: head = (5,4), body = [(5,3)].
Move 1: Left: new head = (4,4) because that cell is not occupied by any part of the snake. So result: head=(4,4), then old head becomes second segment at (5,4) and tail remains (5,3). 
Snake now occupies {(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}.
Move 2: Up: new head = (4,5). Check snake positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3); (4,5) is not occupied. So result: head=(4,5), then chain becomes [(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Now snake occupies {(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}.
Move 3: Left: new head = (3,5). Check snake positions: currently occupied {(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}. (3,5) is not there. So result: head=(3,5); chain becomes [(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Now snake occupies {(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}.
Move 4: Up: new head = (3,6). Check occupancy: currently occupied {(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)}. (3,6) is free. So result: head=(3,6); chain becomes [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Now snake occupies {(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}.
Move 5: Left: new head = (2,6). Check occupancy: currently occupied {(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}. (2,6) is free. So result: head=(2,6); chain becomes [(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Now snake occupies {(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}.
Move 6: Up: new head = (2,7). Check occupancy: currently occupied {(2,6),(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)}. (2,7) is free. So result: head=(2,7); chain becomes [(2,6),(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Now snake occupies {(2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}.
Move 7: Left: new head = (1,7). Check occupancy: currently occupied {(2,7),(2,6),(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)}. (1,7) is free. So result: head=(1,7); chain becomes [(2,7),(2,6),(3,6),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)].
Now snake occupies {(1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)}.

This sequence is valid and reaches the apple at (1,7) in 7 moves. And since Manhattan distance from start to target is |5-1| + |4-7|= 4+3=7, this is optimal if no self-collision occurs. So answer: minimum steps required = 7.

But wait, I must check if the snake's body might be in conflict with the path. But we already verified each move's cell was not occupied by any snake segment at that time. So it works.

Thus answer: The shortest sequence of moves is "Left, Up, Left, Up, Left, Up, Left". The minimum number of steps required is 7.

However, let me double-check if there might be a different path with fewer than 7 moves? Manhattan distance is 7, so no path can have less than 7 moves. So answer: 7 moves and sequence "L U L U L U L" or similar variant that avoids collisions.

But wait: the snake's initial configuration: head at (5,4) and tail at (5,3). The Manhattan distance between these points is indeed 7 steps. But we need to check if any intermediate step might be blocked by the snake's own body. We already simulated "L U L U L U L". And it worked.

Double-check potential issues: sometimes with snake puzzles, the tail moves off automatically when you move, so the cell vacated might become available for occupancy later in the sequence. But here simulation is straightforward because we consider after each move that the tail's last position is removed and then check collision.

I want to simulate with the "L U L U L U L" path step by step in terms of snake positions (list order: head, second segment, etc) while considering removal of tail at each step. We did it above.

Let me check move-by-move more carefully:
Initial positions: Head = A=(5,4), body = B=(5,3). So occupied cells: {(5,4),(5,3)}.
Move 1 (L): New head becomes (4,4). Check if (4,4) is free; yes, since it's not in {(5,4),(5,3)}. Then remove tail from snake. But careful: which cell gets removed? The original tail (B=(5,3)) is removed and replaced by new head. So new snake positions become: Head = (4,4), then previous head becomes second segment: (5,4), then tail removed. So occupied cells become {(4,4),(5,4)}.
Move 2 (U): New head from (4,4) upward is (4,5). Check occupancy: {(4,4),(5,4)}. (4,5) is free, so new snake becomes: Head=(4,5), then segments: (4,4), (5,4). Occupied cells become {(4,5),(4,4),(5,4)}.
Move 3 (L): New head from (4,5) left to (3,5). Check occupancy: {(4,5),(4,4),(5,4)}. (3,5) is free. Then remove tail: the current tail was (5,4) but that cell might be freed up now? But it doesn't matter because we are not going to move into it soon. New snake becomes: Head=(3,5), then segments: (4,5),(4,4). Occupied cells become {(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)}.
Move 4 (U): From head (3,5) upward to (3,6). Check occupancy: {(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)}. Free. Then remove tail from snake; tail was (4,4). New snake becomes: Head=(3,6), then segments: (3,5),(4,5). Occupied cells become {(3,6),(3,5),(4,5)}.
Move 5 (L): From head (3,6) left to (2,6). Check occupancy: {(3,6),(3,5),(4,5)}. Free. Then remove tail; tail was (4,5). New snake becomes: Head=(2,6), then segments: (3,6),(3,5). Occupied cells become {(2,6),(3,6),(3,5)}.
Move 6 (U): From head (2,6) upward to (2,7). Check occupancy: {(2,6),(3,6),(3,5)}. Free. Then remove tail; tail was (3,5). New snake becomes: Head=(2,7), then segments: (2,6),(3,6). Occupied cells become {(2,7),(2,6),(3,6)}.
Move 7 (L): From head (2,7) left to (1,7). Check occupancy: {(2,7),(2,6),(3,6)}. Free. Then remove tail; tail was (3,6). New snake becomes: Head=(1,7), then segments: (2,7),(2,6). Occupied cells become {(1,7),(2,7),(2,6)}.
So it's valid.

Thus answer: Minimum steps required = 7 moves with one sequence being L U L U L U L. 

I'll now produce the final result accordingly. I can mention that a possible optimal path is: Left, Up, Left, Up, Left, Up, Left. That yields reaching (1,7) after exactly 7 moves.

However, let me consider if any other sequence might also work. But no matter what, it must have 7 moves because Manhattan distance is 7 and snake can move optimally without collision due to tail leaving cells in the correct order.

I can mention that we assume that once a cell becomes free after the snake's tail leaves, it may be used for subsequent moves as long as it doesn't conflict with another segment. But I've already ensured that.

Thus final answer: 7 moves is required, and one such sequence is L U L U L U L. So answer is: 7 steps, and an example move order is: left, up, left, up, left, up, left.

I'll now produce the final answer accordingly.</think>We can solve this problem by “growing” the snake step‐by–step from its initial configuration and checking that each new head position does not collide with any part of the snake’s body. In our scenario:

• The snake’s head starts at (5,4)  
• Its only segment (the tail) is at (5,3)

The apple is located at (1,7). Notice that in a grid where you can move only up, down, left, or right, the minimum number of moves required from one cell to another (if there were no obstacles) is given by the Manhattan distance. Here,

 Manhattan distance = |5 – 1| + |4 – 7| = 4 + 3 = 7

This tells us that at least 7 moves are necessary if we can “thread” the snake through its own body without colliding.

One possible optimal move sequence is:
 Left, Up, Left, Up, Left, Up, Left

Let’s verify step‐by–step that this sequence avoids self-collision. We’ll denote the snake as a list of occupied cells (with the head at index 0) and note that when the snake moves its head in one direction, it also “drops” its tail (the last element).

Initial configuration:
 Head = (5,4), Tail = (5,3)
 Occupied: {(5,4), (5,3)}

Now follow the moves:

1. Move Left from (5,4) → New head becomes (4,4).  
 Before moving, check that (4,4) is not occupied by any segment [(5,4),(5,3)].  
 Then remove the tail at (5,3).  
 New snake: Head = (4,4), then (5,4).

2. Move Up from (4,4) → New head becomes (4,5).  
 Check that (4,5) is not occupied by {(4,4),(5,4)}.  
 Remove tail: (5,4) is removed.  
 New snake: Head = (4,5), then (4,4).

3. Move Left from (4,5) → New head becomes (3,5).  
 Check that (3,5) is free relative to {(4,5),(4,4)}.  
 Remove tail: (4,4) is removed.  
 New snake: Head = (3,5), then (4,5).

4. Move Up from (3,5) → New head becomes (3,6).  
 Check that (3,6) is free relative to {(3,5),(4,5)}.  
 Remove tail: (4,5) is removed.  
 New snake: Head = (3,6), then (3,5).

5. Move Left from (3,6) → New head becomes (2,6).  
 Check that (2,6) is free relative to {(3,6),(3,5)}.  
 Remove tail: (3,5) is removed.  
 New snake: Head = (2,6), then (3,6).

6. Move Up from (2,6) → New head becomes (2,7).  
 Check that (2,7) is free relative to {(2,6),(3,6)}.  
 Remove tail: (3,6) is removed.  
 New snake: Head = (2,7), then (2,6).

7. Move Left from (2,7) → New head becomes (1,7).  
 Check that (1,7) is free relative to {(2,7),(2,6)}.  
 Remove tail: (2,6) is removed.  
 New snake: Head = (1,7), then (2,7).

After the 7th move, the snake’s head reaches (1,7)—the apple’s location—and no self-collision occurred at any step.

Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 7 and one valid sequence of moves is:
 Left, Up, Left, Up, Left, Up, Left.
