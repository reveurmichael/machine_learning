<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (5,2) to the apple at (0,9). The current direction is DOWN, and the body is just one cell at (5,3). Hmm.

First, let's understand the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction immediately. So if it's currently going DOWN, the first move can't be UP. But after that, it can change direction as needed.

The apple is at (0,9), which is up and to the left from the head. From (5,2) to (0,9), I need to move 5 units to the left (from x=5 to x=0) and 7 units up (from y=2 to y=9). So overall, the snake needs more LEFT moves than RIGHT and more UP moves than DOWN.

The current direction is DOWN. The first move can't be opposite, which would be UP in this case, but since it's DOWN, the next move can't be UP? Wait no: rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. So if moving DOWN, you can't switch to UP immediately. But in this case, current direction is DOWN, so the first move can't be UP.

Wait, no: current direction is DOWN. If I'm going to make a move, the next direction can't be opposite of current. Since current is DOWN, the next move can't be UP because that's the reverse. So possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT? Or wait, what defines reversing? Oh, right: for example, if moving UP, you can't switch to DOWN immediately.

So from a DOWN direction, the first move can't be UP. So possible directions after current is DOWN are LEFT and RIGHT, but not UP.

Wait no, the first move is the next step. Since the snake's current direction is DOWN, the next move (the first in our moves list) must not reverse that direction. So moving DOWN again is allowed? Or does it have to change?

Wait, rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. So if the current direction is DOWN, then the next direction can't be UP because that's reversing. But moving LEFT, RIGHT, or staying in DOWN (but direction vectors are only four main directions; perhaps "NONE" allows any move). Wait, no: in the initial state, the current direction is DOWN, so the first move cannot be UP.

Wait, I think the movement works like this: each time you choose a new direction, it can't be opposite of the previous. So if currently moving DOWN (direction vector (0,-1)), then next direction can't be UP (0,1), but can be LEFT (-1,0), RIGHT (1,0), or DOWN again? Or wait, is that allowed?

Wait, the initial current direction is DOWN, so the first move cannot be opposite. So possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT. Because moving in the same direction (DOWN) would not be a reverse.

Wait no: perhaps if you're already going DOWN, you can continue going DOWN as much as needed, but you can't suddenly switch to UP. So for the first move after current direction is DOWN, the allowed moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN? Or does the direction have to change each time?

Hmm, I think that movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction on the next step. So from DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. But it can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue in DOWN.

Wait, but if you're moving DOWN and then move LEFT or RIGHT, that's a 90-degree turn, which is allowed as long as it's not reversing.

So first, let's note that from (5,2), the snake is currently going DOWN. So next move can't be UP.

But wait, the apple is at (0,9). To get there, the snake needs to move up a lot and left. But starting from (5,2) moving in the current direction of DOWN would take it further away from the target because y decreases when moving DOWN.

Wait no: (5,2), moving DOWN takes y from 2 to 1, then 0, which is further down. So that's not helpful for reaching (0,9). So perhaps I should change direction early on.

But the first move can't be UP because it's reversing. Wait, current direction is DOWN, so next direction can't be UP. Oh wait, no: rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. If current is DOWN, then UP would be a reversal, which is not allowed in the next step. So the first move can only be LEFT or RIGHT.

Wait that's a problem because if I have to go up eventually but my first move can't be UP, how do I get there?

Alternatively, perhaps after moving left or right, I can then change direction upwards without reversing.

Let me try to plan the path step by step.

Starting position: head at (5,2), body at (5,3). Current direction is DOWN. So next move can't be UP.

Possible first moves: LEFT to (4,2) or RIGHT to (6,2).

If I go LEFT to (4,2):

Now, the snake's new head is (4,2), and the body becomes [(5,3), (4,2)]. Direction is now LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse direction.

Wait no: direction after moving LEFT is now LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT as it's the opposite direction. So possible moves are UP or DOWN, but since the snake was going LEFT, can't switch to RIGHT.

But wait, from (4,2), where do I want to go? The apple is at (0,9). So perhaps moving up is better, but first move after LEFT can be UP?

Wait, let's think:

After moving LEFT once: head at (4,2). Next direction cannot be RIGHT.

If next move is UP, that would take the head to (4,3), which is moving towards y=9. That seems good.

But wait, when you change direction from LEFT to UP, is that allowed? Since the previous direction was LEFT, and now changing to UP, it's a 90-degree turn, so it's not reversing. So it's allowed.

So let me see:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,2)

Now, body is [(5,3), (4,2)]. Direction is LEFT.

Move 2: Can't go RIGHT, but can go UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

If I move UP to (4,3):

Body becomes [(5,3), (4,2), (4,3)].

Now, direction is UP. Next move can't be DOWN.

Next, perhaps moving LEFT again would get me closer to x=0.

But wait, let's think about the required number of moves:

From (5,2) to (0,9):

Need 5 lefts and 7 ups. So total of 12 moves? But maybe it can be done in fewer if some moves are combined.

Wait, but each move is one step, so total steps would be Manhattan distance: |5-0| + |9-2| =5+7=12 steps. So the minimum number of moves needed is 12, and we need exactly 5 lefts (or equivalently, 5 LEFT moves minus 0 RIGHT) and 7 UP moves minus any DOWN.

But since after eating the apple, the tail doesn't shrink, so each move adds a body segment except when an apple is eaten. Wait no: per rule 4, after eating the apple, the body grows by one segment without shrinking on next move.

So in this case, since we have only one body cell at (5,3), and when moving towards the apple, each step will add to the body unless the apple is eaten.

But for planning the path, perhaps I should first focus on getting to the apple without colliding with the body, then consider growth.

Wait, but let's think about the movement:

Each move, head moves in direction, body follows. So when moving from (5,2) to (4,2), the body becomes [(5,3), (4,2)]. Next move to (4,3): body becomes [(5,3), (4,2), (4,3)].

So after each move, the previous head becomes part of the body. So we have to make sure that in all future moves, the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body.

So planning a path:

Start at (5,2) direction DOWN, body [(5,3)]. First move can be LEFT or RIGHT because moving UP would reverse from DOWN, which is not allowed.

Let me try moving LEFT first:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,2). Direction now LEFT. Body: [(5,3), (4,2)].

Now, next moves can't go RIGHT.

From (4,2), we need to get up to y=9 and left to x=0.

So perhaps move UP.

Move 2: UP → (4,3). Direction UP. Body: [(5,3), (4,2), (4,3)].

Now, direction is UP; next can't go DOWN.

From here, continue moving UP as much as possible, but that would take a lot of steps and may get the snake into collision with its body.

Alternatively, move LEFT again to reduce x.

Move 2: LEFT → (3,2). Direction LEFT. Body: [(5,3), (4,2), (3,2)].

Now, from (3,2), can move UP or continue LEFT.

But moving UP is better towards the target.

Wait, but let's think about the path:

We need to get x from 5 to 0, which requires moving left five times. And y needs to go up seven times.

So perhaps a strategy is to move left as much as possible first, then up, but since we can't reverse direction immediately after each step, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe I should make the snake turn around the corner, ensuring that it doesn't hit its body.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a square-like path.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal path is to move left four times, then up seven times, but need to avoid collision.

But wait, let's think step by step:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,2). Direction LEFT.

Body after move 1: [(5,3), (4,2)].

Move 2: Can't go RIGHT. So options are UP or DOWN or continue LEFT.

If I move UP to (4,3):

Body becomes [(5,3), (4,2), (4,3)].

Now, direction is UP. Next can't go DOWN.

From here, moving LEFT again would be good:

Move 3: LEFT → (3,3). Direction LEFT. Body adds (4,3) → now body is [ (5,3), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) ].

Wait no, the body includes all previous positions except head. So after move 1: [(5,3), (4,2)].

After move 2: [ (4,2), (4,3) ] → because the new head is (4,3).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused about how the body updates.

Each step:

- New head = current head + direction vector.
- The previous head becomes part of the body (unless the apple is eaten).
- If an apple was eaten in this move, the tail isn't removed. Otherwise, the tail is removed to make space.

Wait, but initially, after each move except when eating the apple, the tail is removed.

In our case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so each move adds a new head and removes the tail.

So for example:

Start: head (5,2), body [(5,3)].

Move 1: LEFT to (4,2). Body becomes [ (5,3), (4,2) ].

Next move: if not eating apple, tail is removed. So new body is [ (4,2) ]? Wait no, that can't be right because each move the body grows by one when eating apple but otherwise remains same length minus one?

Wait no, per rule 5: When the snake eats the apple, it grows by adding a segment without shrinking next move. So normally, after each move (when not eating), the tail is removed.

So initial state:

Head at (5,2). Body cells are [ (5,3) ].

Move 1: LEFT → new head (4,2). Since no apple eaten, body becomes [ (5,3), (4,2) ]? Or wait, perhaps when you move, the old head is added to the body and then if not eating apple, the tail is removed.

Wait, I think the movement works as:

When the snake moves, the new head is added at the front. The previous head becomes part of the body (unless it's eaten an apple in that step). If not, the tail is removed to keep the length same. But when you eat an apple, the tail isn't removed.

So initially, without eating:

After each move, body becomes [previous positions + new head], and then if no apple, remove last position (tail) to maintain the same length.

But in our case, the snake's length is currently 2 (head and one body cell). So when moving, it becomes 3 unless apple is eaten.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to track the body after each move without eating apple:

Move 1: LEFT → head at (4,2), body [ (5,3), (4,2) ]? Or does the body only include previous positions except head?

I think the correct way is that when you move, the new head is added, and if not eating, the tail is removed.

So initial state: head (5,2), body [(5,3)].

Move 1: LEFT → new head (4,2). Body becomes [ (5,3), (4,2) ] because the previous head (5,2) is now part of the body? No, wait, the body includes all the cells except the head. So after moving, the new head is at (4,2), and the body consists of the old positions except the head.

Wait, no: the body is a list of positions excluding the head.

So when you move, the new head is added to the front, and if you didn't eat an apple, the last cell in the body is removed.

So initial state:

head (5,2), body [ (5,3) ].

Move 1: LEFT → new head (4,2). Body becomes [ (5,3), (4,2) ] because no apple eaten. Wait, but that would make the snake longer, which isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the rule is:

- Each move adds a new head.
- If you eat an apple, the body grows by one segment.
- Otherwise, the tail is removed to maintain length.

So initial length: 2 (head and one body cell).

Move 1: LEFT → new head (4,2). Since no apple eaten, the snake's length remains 2. So the old head (5,2) becomes part of the body? No, because the body only includes previous positions except the current head.

Wait, maybe I should model it as:

Body is a queue of cells, starting from the tail to the current head's previous position.

Each move: new head is added. If not eating apple, remove the oldest cell (tail) to keep the same length.

So initial state:

body = deque([5,3]), head= (5,2).

Wait, perhaps this isn't helping. Maybe it's better to think that each move adds the new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

In our case, since we haven't eaten the apple yet, after each move except the last one, the body will be length 2: [previous positions].

But I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try to proceed with the path planning.

Move 1: LEFT → (4,2). Direction is now LEFT.

Body becomes [(5,3), (4,2)] because no apple eaten; but actually, in reality, when moving, the old head (5,2) would be added to the body, making it longer unless we eat an apple. But since we didn't eat, perhaps the tail is removed, so the body becomes [ (5,3), (4,2) ].

Wait, maybe I should just focus on ensuring that in each step, the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body except the immediate predecessor.

But for now, let's proceed.

Move 1: LEFT → (4,2). Direction is LEFT. Body cells are [5,3, 4,2].

Wait, no, perhaps the body after move 1 is [ (5,3), (4,2) ] since we didn't eat the apple, so the tail is removed? Or does it stay as two segments?

I think that without eating an apple, each move adds a new head and removes the tail to keep the length same. But initially, the snake was of length 2 (head + one body cell). So after moving, the new head is added, making length 3, then if not eating, remove the oldest cell.

So:

After move 1: head is (4,2), body cells are [5,3], because when you add (4,2) and then remove (5,3) from front? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the body as all previous positions except the current head. So each move, the new head is added, and the oldest cell is removed if not eating an apple.

So:

Start: head (5,2), body [5,3].

Move 1: LEFT → new head (4,2). Since no apple eaten, remove the oldest cell from body, which is (5,3). So body becomes empty? That can't be right.

Wait, that would make the snake's length decrease, which isn't correct because normally when you move, the body follows.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to proceed with the moves and assume that the body grows only when eating apple.

So, let's plan the moves:

1. Move LEFT → (4,2). Direction LEFT.

Body becomes [(5,3), (4,2)] since we didn't eat.

2. Move UP → (4,3). Now direction is UP.

Check if any collision with body. The body cells are [ (5,3), (4,2) ]. New head is (4,3). Does this collide with any? No, because it's not in the body. So safe.

Body becomes [ (5,3), (4,2), (4,3) ] since we didn't eat apple, but wait, no: each move adds new head and removes tail unless eating.

So from step 1, after moving LEFT, body is [(5,3), (4,2)].

From step 2, moving UP to (4,3). Since we didn't eat, the oldest cell (5,3) is removed. So body becomes [ (4,2), (4,3) ].

Wait, that makes more sense: after each move, add new head and remove tail if not eating apple.

So:

After step 1: head (4,2), body [ (5,3) ] because we added (4,2) but removed the oldest cell to keep length same.

Wait no, initial length is 2. After moving, it becomes 3? No, I think the snake's length increases only when eating apple. Otherwise, it remains same.

So, initial body length: 1 (excluding head). So after move 1, new head (4,2), and body includes previous positions except current head.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just list each step with the head and body:

Initial state:

head: (5,2)

body: [ (5,3) ]

Step 1: Move LEFT

new_head: (4,2)

since no apple eaten, remove oldest cell from body.

But wait, initial body is [5,3]. After moving, new head is (4,2). So the new body would be [ (5,3), (4,2) ]? No, that's two cells, making total length 3. But without eating, it should stay at 2.

So perhaps after each move except when eating, the snake's length remains same, meaning the oldest cell is removed.

Wait, this is conflicting. Maybe I should think that when you move and don't eat, the tail is removed to keep the body length same as before the move.

In initial state, body has 1 cell. After moving, new head added, so body would have 2 cells. Then, remove oldest to make it back to 1 cell.

So:

Step 1: LEFT → (4,2)

body becomes [ (5,3), (4,2) ] but then remove oldest (5,3) → body is [ (4,2) ]

Wait that makes sense: the new head is added, making the body length increase by one, but since no apple eaten, remove the oldest cell to keep same length.

So after move 1:

head: (4,2)

body: [ (4,2) ] → because we added (4,2), then removed (5,3). So now the body is just [ (4,2) ].

Wait, that can't be right because then the snake's length isn't increasing. Maybe it's better to think differently.

Perhaps when you move without eating, the body shifts forward: each cell moves to the next position, and the last cell is removed.

So:

Initial state:

head (5,2), body [ (5,3) ]

Step 1: LEFT → new head (4,2)

body becomes [ (4,2) ] because the previous body [ (5,3) ] moves to follow, but since we didn't eat, it's just the new head.

Wait, no. When you move, all body cells follow the head. So:

After step 1: LEFT

new head is (4,2), and the body cell (5,3) moves to (4,2)'s previous position? No, that would make the body at (5,3) move to (4,2).

Wait, perhaps each cell in the body follows the next one.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Since it's time-consuming and perhaps beyond the scope of this response, I'll proceed with the initial plan:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,2)

Move 2: UP → (4,3)

Now, from (4,3), need to move left and up.

But since we can't reverse direction immediately, after moving UP, next moves can be LEFT or DOWN, but not RIGHT.

So perhaps:

Move 3: LEFT → (3,3). Direction is now LEFT.

From here, continue moving LEFT until x=0, then UP.

But let's see:

Move 4: LEFT → (2,3)

Move 5: LEFT → (1,3)

Move 6: LEFT → (0,3)

Now at (0,3), need to move UP seven times.

But wait, can we do that without hitting the body?

From (0,3):

Move 7: UP → (0,4). Direction is UP.

Check body after each move:

After move 6: head is (0,3), body cells are [previous positions].

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact body positions, but as long as the new head doesn't collide with any existing body cell except the one before it, it's safe.

So perhaps this path works.

But wait, from (0,3), moving UP to (0,4) is possible. Then continue:

Move 8: UP → (0,5)

Move 9: UP → (0,6)

Move10: UP → (0,7)

Move11: UP → (0,8)

Move12: UP → (0,9). But wait, we need to reach y=9?

Wait, initial head was at (5,2). So moving up from (0,3) would go through y=4,5,...,9.

So after six UP moves:

From (0,3):

Move7: (0,4)

Move8: (0,5)

Move9: (0,6)

Move10: (0,7)

Move11: (0,8)

Move12: (0,9). So we've reached y=9.

But that's 12 moves. Let me count:

Moves 1-6: moving left from x=5 to x=0 at y=3.

Then moves 7-12: moving up from y=3 to y=9 at x=0.

Total of 12 moves, which would take us beyond the initial steps.

But I'm not sure if this is the most efficient path. Maybe there's a shorter way by moving in another direction first.

Alternatively, perhaps starting by moving UP first instead of LEFT would be better.

Let me try that.

Move1: UP → (5,3)

Check body: no collision.

Then move LEFT:

Move2: LEFT → (4,3). Body is [5,3,4,3]?

Wait, again, I'm unsure about the exact body tracking.

But perhaps moving in a square pattern would be more efficient.

Alternatively, after moving up once, then left multiple times, then down, but that might not help.

I think the initial plan of moving left to x=0, then up to y=9 is feasible, totaling 6 moves left and 6 moves up, for a total of 12 moves. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, if we can move diagonally, but since movement is grid-based, probably only horizontal or vertical.

Wait, no diagonal movement allowed in this problem.

So perhaps the shortest path is indeed moving left to x=0 (5 steps), then up to y=9 (7 steps from y=2 to y=9). Wait, initial y was 2, so need to move up 7 times: from 2→3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So that's 7 moves.

So total moves: 5 left +7 up =12 moves.

But let me recount:

From (5,2):

Move1: LEFT →4,2

Move2: LEFT →3,2

Move3: LEFT→2,2

Move4: LEFT→1,2

Move5: LEFT→0,2. Now at x=0.

Then move up:

Move6: UP→0,3

Move7: UP→0,4

Move8: UP→0,5

Move9: UP→0,6

Move10:UP→0,7

Move11:UP→0,8

Move12:UP→0,9.

So yes, 12 moves total.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first then left would save a move?

Wait, initial position (5,2). If we move up to (5,3), then left to (0,3), and then up to (0,9).

That would be:

Move1: UP→5,3

Move2: LEFT→4,3

...

Move6: LEFT→0,3. Then move up 6 times to reach y=9.

Total moves: 6 left +7 up =13 moves, which is worse.

So moving left first is better with 12 moves.

Therefore, the shortest path requires 12 moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting point (5, 2) to the target position (0, 9) on a grid. The movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions only. 

### Approach
The optimal strategy involves moving leftwards to reach x=0 first and then moving upwards to reach y=9. This approach ensures that we minimize the number of moves by covering the required distances in each direction efficiently.

1. **Move Left**: From (5, 2), move left five times to reduce the x-coordinate from 5 to 0.
2. **Move Up**: Once at (0, 2), move up seven times to increase the y-coordinate from 2 to 9.

### Solution Code
```python
# Starting position
x, y = 5, 2

# Move left to reach x=0
for _ in range(5):
    x -= 1
    print(f"Move LEFT to ({x}, {y})")

# Now move up to reach y=9
for _ in range(7):
    y += 1
    print(f"Move UP to ({x}, {y})")
```

### Explanation
- **Step-by-Step Movement**: The code first moves the position from (5, 2) leftwards five times, resulting in reaching (0, 2). This is done using a loop that decrements the x-coordinate five times.
- **Upward Movement**: After reaching x=0, the code then moves upwards seven times to reach y=9. This is achieved with another loop that increments the y-coordinate seven times.

This approach ensures that we cover the required horizontal and vertical distances in the minimum number of steps, resulting in a total of 12 moves.
