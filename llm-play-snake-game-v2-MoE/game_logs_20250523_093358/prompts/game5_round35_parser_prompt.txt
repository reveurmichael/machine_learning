You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
I'll analyze the current game state to determine the best path for the snake to reach the apple while avoiding collisions and following all the movement rules.

Let's break down the information:

- **Current head position**: (1, 6)
- **Apple position**: (5, 9)
- **Current direction**: DOWN
- **Body cells**: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)]

First, I need to calculate the offsets required to move from the head's current position (1, 6) to the apple at (5, 9):

- To reach x=5 from x=1: We need RIGHT moves. Difference = 5 - 1 = 4
- To reach y=9 from y=6: We need UP moves. Difference = 9 - 6 = 3

So we need a total of:
- 4 RIGHT moves to increase x-coordinate by 4 units
- 3 UP moves to increase y-coordinate by 3 units

Let's plan the path while ensuring safety and following movement rules:

1. We start at (1, 6) moving DOWN.
2. As per constraints, we can't reverse direction initially.

Since the current direction is DOWN, we'll avoid going UP immediately and need to calculate a safe sequence of moves.

Let's consider potential paths and obstacles:
- From (1, 6), let's move RIGHT (x increases)
- Then UP (y increases)

The snake currently cannot go left because it would collide with its body [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)].

So the moves could be:
1. Keep moving DOWN until we can safely turn RIGHT
2. Move RIGHT and UP

Let's simulate this path step-by-step:

Starting at (1, 6):
- Current direction is DOWN.
- Let's move DOWN once to avoid immediate body collision.

From there, let’s analyze the grid more carefully:
```
(1, 6) -> DOWN -> (1, 5)
```

Now we can go RIGHT safely and then UP:
- From (1, 5): Move RIGHT until x=5
- Then UP from (5, 5) to (5, 9)

The safe path will be: DOWN → RIGHT × 4 → UP × 3

Let’s construct the JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move from (1,6) to (5,9) with a safe path avoiding body collision. First move DOWN once to avoid immediate collision, then RIGHT until x=5 and UP until y=9."
}
```

This plan ensures that the snake avoids colliding with its own body while heading towards the apple at (5, 9).
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (1, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)], to eat the apple at (5, 9).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
