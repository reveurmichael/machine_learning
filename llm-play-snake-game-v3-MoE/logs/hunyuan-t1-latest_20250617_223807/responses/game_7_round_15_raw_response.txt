"reasoning": "The snake starts at (2,1) with a body blocking upward movement from (2,1) to (2,2). To reach the apple at (4,8), the snake first moves right along y=1 to x=9 (7 moves), avoiding body segments. Then moves up along x=9 to y=8 (7 moves), staying clear of the body which shifts right. Finally, moves left along y=8 from x=9 to x=4 (5 moves), reaching the apple. This path avoids collisions and ensures safe movement by leveraging the grid's edges and the body's position."
