========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out how to help this user by planning a safe path for their snake to reach the apple at (0,8) from (5,5). Let me start by understanding all the rules and constraints provided.

First, the snake's current position is at (5,5), facing none—so it can move in any direction except reversing on the first move. The body cells are empty because the list is []. The apple is at (0,8), which means the snake needs to move left 5 times and up 3 times more than down.

The key here is to calculate how many LEFTs minus RIGHTs should be +5 for x-direction and UPs minus DOWNs should be +3. Also, the snake can't reverse direction immediately, so if it's moving up, next can't be down.

Now, thinking about the path: from (5,5), moving left to decrease x each time until reaching 0 is logical. But how do we get y from 5 to 8? That requires more UPs than DOWNs by 3. So maybe move left and occasionally up when necessary without getting stuck.

But wait, what's the grid size? It's 10x10, so moving from (5,5) all the way down would take a lot of steps, but since we can adjust direction, perhaps taking some LEFTs and then some UPs will work. However, reversing is not allowed on the first move.

Wait, another thought: if I keep moving left, x decreases each time. But to increase y from 5 to 8, maybe alternate between LEFT and UP in a way that doesn't cause collisions with walls or body.

Also, once the snake eats the apple, it grows, so there's no shrinking tail next move—important for not getting stuck.

Let me try mapping possible moves:

Starting at (5,5). Possible first moves could be LEFT to start moving towards 0 in x. But let's check if that would cause issues. Moving left once to (4,5), then again to (3,5), etc., until reaching (0, something).

But how do I get from y=5 to y=8? Let's see: need net UP moves of +3.

If after moving left a few times, start moving up when possible. But have to ensure that each move doesn't cause the snake to collide with its body or walls.

Alternatively, maybe go LEFT until x is 0, then change direction towards UP without reversing immediately if necessary—but first move can be any except NONE reversed.

Wait, initial direction after starting from (5,5) is "NONE", so first move could be in any valid direction. But moving down would take it to y=4; but let's think step by step.

Perhaps the optimal path is to move LEFT each time until x becomes 0 and then move UP as much as needed without overlapping body or getting stuck. However, since the initial position has no body cells (body list is empty), the first few moves can be made freely.

Wait another thing: The snake's movement involves shifting its head in a direction, and the tail only retracts if it eats the apple. So initially, when moving LEFT without eating, the body will grow as the snake moves left each time, but since there are no body cells yet, that might not be an issue.

But wait, once the snake starts moving left, after five moves, x becomes 0, and then we can start moving up to increase y. Since initially, the body is empty, so the head is at (5,5), next move LEFT to (4,5). Then another LEFT to (3,5), etc., until (0,5). Now, from here, since direction was LEFT, cannot reverse to RIGHT or DOWN immediately—wait no: rule says can't reverse on first move. But the initial direction is NONE; so after moving LEFT once, next move can be any except RIGHT.

Wait correction: Rule 3 says that if current direction is "NONE", any move is allowed. So after first move as LEFT, next can be UP, DOWN, LEFT again, or RIGHT? Wait no—rule 2 specifies the direction vectors for each move, and rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction on the first move.

Wait more accurately: The direction reversal is only forbidden when current direction is something other than NONE. For example, if moving UP, next can't be DOWN. But if starting from NONE (i.e., initial state), any direction is allowed regardless of previous moves because there's no previous non-NONE direction to reverse.

So first move after NONE can be anything except reversing—wait no: Actually, rule 3 says the snake cannot reverse direction on the next move if it was moving in a valid direction. Wait, maybe I need to read rule 3 more carefully:

Rule 3 says: The snake **cannot** reverse direction (e.g., UP then DOWN is not allowed). If current direction is "NONE", any move is allowed.

So when initial state is NONE, next can be any of the four directions without restriction except that if you were moving in a previous direction and cannot reverse. So for example:

If first move was RIGHT, next cannot be LEFT. But since starting from NONE, no prior direction—so after moving RIGHT once, next move can't be LEFT.

But in our case, initial state is NONE, so any move is allowed (no prior direction to reverse). Thus, the first move can be LEFT, which would set current direction to LEFT. Then the second move cannot be RIGHT; it could be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

Wait no: because if you were moving LEFT, then next can't be RIGHT?

No, rule 3 says that after a valid direction (not NONE), you can't reverse on the next move—i.e., you can't do the opposite. So for example:

If current direction is LEFT, next cannot be RIGHT.

But in initial state: direction is NONE, so any move allowed regardless of prior directions.

So to plan path from (5,5) towards apple at (0,8), let's consider movement strategy.

First idea: Move left 5 times to reach x=0, then up 3 times. But need to ensure that each step doesn't cause the snake to collide with its body or walls before reaching there.

But since initial position has no body cells, moving straight without any turns is possible until (0,5). Then from (0,5), move up three steps to reach (0,8).

Let's check if that works:

Start at (5,5), direction NONE.

Move LEFT → (4,5) [direction LEFT]

Move LEFT → (3,5)

Move LEFT → (2,5)

Move LEFT → (1,5)

Move LEFT → (0,5)

Now current position is (0,5), direction still LEFT. Now, since next move cannot be RIGHT because of previous LEFT.

But from here, moving UP would take us to (0,6). Then again UP to (0,7), then UP to (0,8).

So steps:

1. LEFT → (4,5)
2. LEFT → (3,5)
3. LEFT → (2,5)
4. LEFT → (1,5)
5. LEFT → (0,5)

Now direction is LEFT.

6. Can't move RIGHT next; so must choose other directions—easiest to move UP: (0,6). Now new direction is UP.

7. From (0,6), can't reverse from UP? No; rule 3 says if moving in a valid direction (like UP) and previous was something else, you can only not reverse that specific prior direction.

Wait current direction after step5 is LEFT, then step6 is UP—so next move cannot be DOWN, but can do anything else. So yes, from (0,5), moving up to (0,6). Then again UP: (0,7), and again UP: (0,8)—apple's position.

So the moves would be:

["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP"]

But wait: Let me check if moving up after left is allowed. Since current direction was LEFT, which had to move left again unless reversed—after 5 steps of left, next cannot reverse from LEFT, so moving UP is allowed.

Wait no, the rule says that you can't reverse on next step relative to previous valid direction.

So once you were moving LEFT, your next move can't be RIGHT. But could it still move in other directions like UP or DOWN? Yes.

Therefore, after (0,5), moving up three times is allowed without any problem because the last move was LEFT; thus moving up is fine as long as not trying to reverse from LEFT.

But wait: After step5, direction was LEFT. So next move can't be RIGHT—so in step6, we choose UP or DOWN. But moving UP is acceptable because it's not a reversal of direction (left).

Hence the plan seems valid. Now check for collisions:

Each step, snake's head moves and body shifts.

But wait: The problem says that after each move, the body cells shift by adding the new head position—unless apple is eaten. So in this case, since we're not eating any apples until reaching (0,8), the body will just grow as the snake moves.

Wait no—the initial body list is empty because it's given as []. So when moving left five times:

Start: head at (5,5)

After 1st move LEFT → new head (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)]

Second move LEFT → new head (3,5); body shifts to [(5,5), (4,5)]

Wait no—no. Wait the problem says that each move adds a new segment as head and removes tail unless apple is eaten.

Wait according to the update rules: After moving, new head is added at the direction, then body cells shift by adding the new head, except when eating apple, in which case tail remains.

So initial body is empty. So after first move LEFT:

Head moves from (5,5) → (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)]? Or does it become [new head]?

Wait no—wait snake's body cells are the positions of the segments excluding the head. Wait, wait let me recheck: The current description says "Body cells" is a list of positions occupied by the snake's body (excluding the head). So when moving, new head is added to the front and tail removed or kept based on eating.

So initial position:

- Head: (5,5)

- Body: [] → because no other segments except head.

When first move LEFT→ (4,5):

New head is (4,5), body becomes [(5,5)]?

Wait but according to the movement update rules:

1. New head = head + direction

2. Head becomes body segment—no, wait it's not clear from the wording. Let me recheck.

The problem says: "Snake movement update (per move):"

- New head = head + direction → that is, moving in the given direction.

- Then, the new head is added as a new segment at the front of the body.

Wait but then, how about the tail? If it doesn't eat apple, tail is removed—so previous last cell is dropped. So when not eating, each move adds one to the body and removes one from the end.

Therefore:

Initial state: head (5,5), body [] → total 1 segment (head only).

After first move LEFT:

Head becomes (4,5). Body now is [(5,5)] + [new head] ?

Wait no—perhaps when moving, new head is added to the front and tail removed.

So initial position: head at (5,5), body empty. After moving left, new head is (4,5); since not apple, remove the tail but there's no tail—it stays as just a single cell?

Hmm this part is confusing. Let me try another approach.

Wait according to rules:

- When moving, new head position is computed by adding direction vector to current head.

- Then, body cells are shifted: meaning that each segment moves forward in the same direction as before? Or wait—no—the body follows the head.

But perhaps it's simpler to think of the snake as a list of positions from head to tail. Each move adds new head and removes old tail if not eating apple.

So:

Initially, snake is [ (5,5) ]

After moving LEFT: [ (4,5), (5,5) ] → no, that would mean body is [(5,5)]. Or maybe it's [new head] + previous body?

Wait the problem says "the head becomes the body segment", which seems like adding to the front. So:

Each move adds a new head at position (x,y), and then appends this as the next segment of the body.

But if snake is not eating apple, it's tail removed—so from [h1], after moving LEFT: [h2, h1] → but no because initial body was empty. So maybe when not eating apple, the new head becomes the first segment, and all other segments shift forward, with the last segment being dropped.

Wait this is getting complicated without exact movement rules.

But perhaps to proceed, let's think that each move, snake's position shifts as follows:

- New head is added at direction step.

- The body shifts so that new head is front, previous positions follow, and tail is removed unless apple is eaten (tail remains).

Therefore, initial state: [5,5]

After first LEFT → new head (4,5), body becomes [(5,5)]

Wait but according to the movement rules, when moving in a direction, the new head is added as the next segment. So snake's body grows by one each time it moves without eating apple.

But then after five steps:

Each step adds another segment and since no tail shrinking (as not eaten), so body becomes longer.

After first move: [5,5] → moved LEFT to 4,5; body is [(5,5)]

Second move: from 4,5, direction LEFT→3,5. Body now would be [(5,5), (4,5)]?

No—wait when you add a new head at the front and shift others.

Wait perhaps initial position is [head]. When moving in a certain direction, new head added to front, body follows by adding previous positions except tail if not eating apple. Hmm I'm getting stuck here; maybe it's better to assume that each move adds one segment, so after five LEFT moves, the snake has six segments (including initial head) but no—since starting from 1 segment.

Wait perhaps:

Each time you move in a direction without eating apple, the body grows by adding the new head at front, and previous positions are pushed back. So for example:

Start: [head] = [5,5]

Move LEFT → new head is (4,5), body becomes [(5,5)] + [new head]? No—wait maybe it's that when moving, you add a new segment at the end of the list as the new head, and remove any old tail.

Wait this isn't clear in problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps each move adds one to the snake's length.

But regardless, since initial body is empty, after five left moves:

Body would have positions (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (0,5).

So after that, when moving up three times, each step adds a new segment at the end of the list.

Wait no—because without eating apple, it's tail is removed. So if you have body [A], and then move in some direction, body becomes [B, A]?

Wait now I'm really confused about how movement affects the snake's body cells. Maybe this problem is not requiring us to simulate each position but only to plan a path.

Given that, perhaps it's okay for me to ignore exact simulation of collision detection because the key here is to reach (0,8) without colliding with walls or itself in between steps.

But given initial head at (5,5), moving left five times would end up at x=0. Let's see if any step causes a collision:

Start: (5,5)

Move LEFT →4,5 → no collision

Then 3,5 → no

2,5→no

1,5→no

(0,5)→no.

So each move to left is fine until x=0.

After that, moving up three times:

From (0,5) → (0,6), then (0,7), then (0,8). Each of these steps is okay as long as y doesn't exceed 8. But since apple is at (0,8), the next step to (0,9) would be outside.

But we are moving up three times from (0,5):

(0,6): valid

(0,7): valid

(0,8): destination.

So these steps don't cause walls being hit because each y is 6,7,8 which are within bounds since grid seems to go beyond 10 or so? Wait problem says nothing about the grid size; just that we can move without going outside. So moving up from (0,5) →(0,6), etc., as long as y<= maximum.

But in any case, this path is valid and reaches apple at (0,8).

So the moves are:

["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP"]

This seems to solve the problem. But let's check if during movement there were any other constraints.

Another point: after each move, if snake would collide with itself (including new head), it's invalid.

But in this path:

First five moves are all LEFT—so body is [5,5], then 4,5;3,5 etc. No collision as the x decreases and y remains same.

Then moving up three times: each time adding to previous positions without any overlap because new head is (0,y) where y increases by one each move, while previous segments are at lower or higher y but not conflicting since they're in the same x=0 line.

Wait no, if body was [5,5], 4,5;3,5 etc. After moving left five times to (0,5), the body is:

[ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (0,5) ]

Then moving up: new head becomes (0,6). So in next step, the body would be [ (5,5), (4,5),..., (0,5) ] → but wait no, because after eating apple? No, we haven't eaten any apples. Wait when you move up:

First step from (0,5): new head is (0,6). Since it's not eating apple, the tail at (5,5) would be dropped.

So body becomes [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6) ]

Wait no: initial snake is 6 segments. After moving up:

New head is added to the front; previous last segment (old tail) is removed.

So after first move UP from (0,5):

Body becomes [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6) ]

Wait no—each time you move, the body shifts forward and new head added. If not eating apple, tail is removed.

So let's think about it as a deque: when moving in any direction except apple:

- The new head is added to the front of the current body.

- Then, if it's not an apple eat, the last (old) tail is removed.

But without being able to simulate exactly, perhaps we can assume that since during this movement, none of these steps would cause snake to collide with itself because each step moves in a direction away from previous positions except for head.

Alternatively, I think this path doesn't have any collision issues. So the answer should be:

["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP"]

But let me check if moving up is possible after turning left five times.

After step 5: (0,5), direction still LEFT. Now when choosing to move UP—since previous was LEFT, so next cannot be RIGHT, but can be any other including DOWN or LEFT? Wait no:

From step5's perspective, where you were moving LEFT for the last time, your current direction is LEFT.

Thus, in step6: after (0,5), moving UP → allowed since it's not a reversal from LEFT. So new position is (0,6).

Now check if that causes any collision with previous body:

Previous segments are [ (4,5), 3,5;2,5;1,5;0,5 ] and adding (0,6). No overlap.

Thus step6 is safe.

Similarly steps7: (0,7) → no collision

Step8: (0,8)

So the moves are as planned.

Therefore, final answer would be moving LEFT five times and then UP three times.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at (5, 5) to reach an apple located at (0, 8). The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. Each movement must be planned carefully to avoid self-collision and walls.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (5, 5) with no body segments except its head.
2. **Direction Planning**: The goal is to move the snake towards the apple located at (0, 8). This can be achieved by first moving left five times to reach x=0 from x=5, then moving up three times to reach y=8 from y=5.
3. **Avoid Self-Collision and Walls**: Each movement should be checked to ensure it does not cause the snake to collide with itself or go out of bounds.

### Solution Code
```python
# The initial position is (5,5)
head = (5, 5)

# Move left five times
moves = ["LEFT"] * 5

# Now move up three times
moves.extend(["UP"] * 3)

print("Moves to reach the apple:", moves)
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Position**: The snake starts at (5, 5).
- **Moving Left Five Times**: Each left move decreases the x-coordinate by 1. After five such moves, the snake's head reaches (0, 5). This path is chosen because moving directly towards the target in the x-direction without changing y keeps the movement straightforward.
- **Moving Up Three Times**: Once at (0, 5), each up move increases the y-coordinate by 1. Moving three times brings the head to (0, 8), which is the position of the apple.

This approach ensures that the snake navigates efficiently from its starting point to the target without causing any collisions or going out of bounds. Each movement step is planned in a way that adheres to the problem constraints and reaches the destination optimally.
