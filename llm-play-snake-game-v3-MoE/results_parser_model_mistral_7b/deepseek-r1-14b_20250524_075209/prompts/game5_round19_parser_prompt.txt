You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (1,7) and needs to reach the apple at (2,9). The current direction is "UP", so I can't move DOWN immediately.

First, I'll visualize the grid. The head is at (1,7), which is one cell below (1,8) and two cells below the apple at (2,9). The body segments are [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)], so the snake is currently moving upwards along x=1.

Since the direction is "UP", my first move can't be "DOWN". So from "UP", I can choose "LEFT", "RIGHT", or stay in "UP".

Looking at the apple's position (2,9), which is to the right and two cells up from the head. The Manhattan distance is 1 (right) + 2 (up) = 3.

I need to find a path that avoids collisions with the body. The body is behind the head along x=1, so moving right first might be safer.

If I move RIGHT, the new head will be at (2,7). Then, I can continue moving UP twice to reach (2,9), avoiding any collision since the body is moving upwards and away from the path.

I'll check each step for collisions:
- Moving RIGHT: New head is (2,7). The body is still along x=1, so no collision.
- Next move UP: Head becomes (2,8). Still safe.
- Final move UP: Reaches (2,9), which is the apple's position.

This path ensures I don't reverse direction and avoids any self-collision. Plus, after eating the apple, the body grows, but since there are still legal moves left, it won't trap me immediately.
</think>

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move right to (2,7), then up twice to reach the apple at (2,9) safely without reversing direction and avoiding body collisions."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (1, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)], to eat the apple at (2, 9).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
