========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 2 units right (from x=7 to 9) and 2 units down (from y=6 to 4). Starting with RIGHT avoids reversing direction. Moving RIGHT twice reaches (9,6), then DOWN twice reaches (9,4) (the apple). Each step checks for collisions: new heads are within bounds and not on body segments. After eating the apple, a LEFT move to (8,4) is safe, ensuring no immediate trapping."
