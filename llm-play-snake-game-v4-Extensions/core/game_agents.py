"""Public contract for any autonomous or interactive policy that can drive the
Snake game.  All first-class agents (LLM, heuristic, RL, human, â€¦) MUST
implement this one-method interface so that the *core* package never needs to
know *who* is providing moves.

Placed in `core/game_agents.py` to follow the `game_*` naming convention that
makes the first-citizen folder easy to grep and keeps a tidy namespace:
