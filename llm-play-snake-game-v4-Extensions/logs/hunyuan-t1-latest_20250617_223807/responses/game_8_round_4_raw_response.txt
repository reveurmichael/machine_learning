========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,8) with a vertical body. To reach the apple at (6,1), the snake needs to move right 6 times (increasing x from 0 to 6) and down 7 times (decreasing y from 8 to 1). Moving right first avoids grid boundaries and body collisions. After reaching (6,8), moving down aligns the head with the apple. Each move is safe as the head avoids walls, body segments, and future body positions. After eating the apple, a down move to (6,0) remains legal, preventing trapping."
