{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 5 LEFT (from x=8 to x=3) and 7 DOWN (from y=9 to y=2). Starting with LEFT avoids immediate collision (UP is out of bounds, DOWN hits body). Moving LEFT 5 times positions the head at (3,9). Then moving DOWN 7 times reaches (3,2) (apple). Each move is safe as the body shifts behind, avoiding collisions. After eating the apple, the body grows, leaving space for a legal next move."
