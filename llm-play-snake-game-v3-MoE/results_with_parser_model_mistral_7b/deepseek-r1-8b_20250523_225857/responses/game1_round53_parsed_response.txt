{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "To move from (0, 0) to (8, 0), first we need to navigate around the snake's body by moving upwards. After reaching a higher row, we can change direction by moving into our own tail at (0, 1). This action causes the head of the snake to face right. Then, we move horizontally to the right until we reach column 8 and finally down to reach (8, 0). The sequence is: (0, 0) \u2192 (0, 1) (change direction by moving into tail) \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 ... \u2192 (8, 1) \u2192 (8, 0)"}
