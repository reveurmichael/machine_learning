========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is currently at (8,7) and needs to reach the apple at (9,8). 

First, I'll note that the head is moving upward because the current direction is "UP". So, the next move can't be "DOWN" due to the no-reverse rule. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE if it's the first move.

Looking at the grid, the snake's body is behind it: [(8,6), (8,5), (8,4)]. The apple is just one cell up and to the right from the head. So ideally, moving RIGHT then UP would get us there. But let's check for collisions.

If we move RIGHT first, the new head would be at (9,7). Checking against the body: none of the body cells are at (9,7), so that's safe. Then, moving UP next would take the head to (9,8), which is the apple's position. 

Wait, but when we eat the apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move. That means after eating, the new body will be longer, and we need to ensure there's at least one valid move afterward. After growing, the snake's body would extend, but from (9,8), possible moves could still be made without collision.

Alternatively, moving UP first might cause issues because the current direction is UP, so moving UP again is allowed unless it collides. Let me check: the new head would be (8,8). The apple is at (9,8), which is to the right. So from there, a move RIGHT would eat the apple. But let's see if this path leads to any collision.

Wait, moving UP first might cause the head to go into (8,8), and then RIGHT to (9,8). Let's check for collisions in both scenarios.

In the first scenario: Move RIGHT then UP.
- After RIGHT, new_head is (9,7) which is safe. Body becomes [(8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)] minus tail if not eating apple. But since we didn't eat yet, the body would just shift as normal, but then moving UP next is fine.

In the second scenario: Move UP then RIGHT.
- After UP, new_head is (8,8). Check if this position is in any body cells except possibly the tail. The body after moving UP would be [(8,7), (8,6), (8,5)] plus the old head, but wait, noâ€”the body shifts each time.

Wait, perhaps it's clearer to plan a path that directly moves towards the apple without unnecessary turns. Since the apple is one cell up and right from the current head, moving RIGHT then UP seems straightforward.

I need to make sure that after eating the apple, there's still a valid move. After growing, the snake will be longer, but as long as we're not in a corner with no escape, it should be fine.

So the optimal path is to first move RIGHT, then UP.
