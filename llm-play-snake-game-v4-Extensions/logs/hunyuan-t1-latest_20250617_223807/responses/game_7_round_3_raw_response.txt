========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move LEFT 6 times (to reduce x from 8 to 2) and DOWN 1 time (to reduce y from 6 to 5). Starting with LEFT moves aligns with the required horizontal path, avoiding immediate collisions with the body. Each LEFT move shifts the head left while the body follows, maintaining safety. After reaching (2,6), a DOWN move to (2,5) reaches the apple. Post-apple, the body is long enough to allow safe subsequent moves (e.g., LEFT or DOWN)."
