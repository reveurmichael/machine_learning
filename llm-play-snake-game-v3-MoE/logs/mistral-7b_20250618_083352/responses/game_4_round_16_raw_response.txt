 {
      "moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN"],
      "reasoning": "First move 'RIGHT' to reach the horizontal coordinate (3,3), and then 'DOWN' to reach the apple at (3,2). This path avoids collisions with walls and other body segments. The snake is currently at (5,3), and the apple is at (3,2). There is one empty cell between the head and the apple, ensuring a safe detour if necessary."
