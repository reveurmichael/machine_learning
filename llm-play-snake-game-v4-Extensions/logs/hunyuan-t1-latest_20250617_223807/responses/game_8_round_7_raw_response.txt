========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 2 times (from x=5 to 7) and down 2 times (from y=2 to 0). Starting with RIGHT avoids reversing direction. Each move is checked for collisions: moving RIGHT to (6,2) and (7,2) is safe as these positions are not occupied by the body. Then moving DOWN to (7,1) and (7,0) (apple) avoids body collisions. After eating the apple, the snake can safely move next (e.g., RIGHT or LEFT) without trapping itself."
