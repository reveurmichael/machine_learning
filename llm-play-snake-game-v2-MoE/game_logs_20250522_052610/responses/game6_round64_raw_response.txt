========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to help the snake reach the apple at (7,1) without dying. Let's start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (0,2), and the body is a list of cells excluding the head. The body starts from [(6,4), ...], but wait, actually, looking closer, the body seems to be [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)]. So the snake's tail is at (1,2) which is directly below the head. Wait, no—the head is at (0,2), so the body starts after that? Hmm, maybe I should visualize this.

The grid is 10x10, with (0,0) being bottom-left and (9,9) top-right. So y increases as we go up. The snake's head is at (0,2). The apple is at (7,1), which is further to the right and slightly down.

First, I need to see if there's a path for the head to move towards the apple without hitting any part of its body or going out of bounds.

The movement rules say that after each move, the snake's body shifts. So when the head moves, it becomes the new first body segment, and all others follow, unless an apple is eaten, in which case the tail doesn't shrink.

So right now, the snake has a body of 8 segments (excluding the head). The current direction is LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing. Wait, no—the current direction is LEFT, so according to rule 3, the next move cannot be DOWN if it was going UP, etc. So since current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. Because moving in the opposite direction would reverse.

Wait, wait. The movement rules say that the snake cannot reverse direction. So for example, if current direction is UP, next can't be DOWN. So current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. Therefore, from LEFT, possible moves are UP or DOWN or continue LEFT? Or does it mean you can't change to the opposite direction? I think it's that you can't reverse direction on the next step. So if moving LEFT now, next move can't be RIGHT.

But wait, in this case, the current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT. But maybe the first move can still go in any direction except the opposite of current direction? Or does the initial move have to follow that rule as well?

Wait, looking at constraint: "Must not reverse direction on the first move." So the first move can't be the opposite of the current direction. Current direction is LEFT, so first move can't be RIGHT.

So starting from (0,2), with head facing LEFT, and body trailing behind, how do we get to (7,1).

The apple is at (7,1). The Manhattan distance is |7-0| + |1-2| = 7 + 1 = 8 steps. But considering the snake's movement constraints and body, it might take more moves.

First, I need to find a path that doesn't collide with the body. Let's see where the body is.

The body cells are [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)]. So from (1,2) up to (0,2) as head. Wait no—the head is at (0,2), so the body starts with (1,2). Then moving up to (2,2), etc.

So the snake's path currently seems to be going upwards in a spiral or something. From (0,2), the next cell is (1,2) which is part of the body. So if the head moves LEFT, it would go to (-1, 2), which is out of bounds—so that's invalid.

Wait, current direction is LEFT, meaning the previous move was LEFT, so from head (0,2), moving LEFT would take it to (-1,2) which is invalid. So the snake can't reverse direction because that would cause death. Therefore, first move cannot be RIGHT, but we have to find another way.

Wait no—the current direction is LEFT, which means the last movement was LEFT. So the head is at (0,2), and before that, it was at (1,2). So the body is behind: from (1,2) up to (6,4).

But wait, how can the snake be in a position where moving LEFT would take it out of bounds? Because current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT. But if the head is at (0,2), and the previous was LEFT from (1,2), then moving further LEFT would go to (-1,2) which is invalid.

So first, we need to make sure that the initial moves don't take the snake into any collision or out of bounds.

So the possible initial directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But since current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. So from (0,2), possible initial moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT? Wait no—the first move cannot reverse direction, so if current direction is LEFT, then first move can't be RIGHT. So the possible moves for the first step are UP, DOWN, LEFT, as long as they don't cause collision.

Wait, but moving LEFT would take it to (-1,2), which is invalid, so that's not allowed. Therefore, initial options are UP or DOWN.

Let me visualize:

Head at (0,2). Body starts at (1,2) and goes up to (6,4). So if the head moves DOWN from (0,2), it would go to (0,1), which is where the apple is. But wait, that's directly below. So moving down once would take the head to (0,1), but then we need to check if this position is safe.

Wait, the body cells include (6,4) and others, so (0,1) is not part of the body yet because it's far away. But after moving, the snake's new head would be at (0,1). Then, the next moves have to avoid the updated body.

But let me think about this path: move DOWN to (0,1), then right towards 7,1.

So from (0,2):

Move 1: DOWN → (0,1) — is this safe?

After moving DOWN, the head becomes (0,1). The old head (0,2) becomes part of the body. So now the body includes (0,2), plus all previous body cells.

So new body cells would be [(6,4), (5,4), ..., (1,2), (0,2)]. So the next position is (0,1). Is that in any body cell? Before this move, no. After moving, but before adding the head to the body: initially, it's not part of the body except for the previous cells.

Wait, after a move, the new head becomes the first element of the body, and all others shift accordingly unless an apple is eaten. Since we haven't eaten the apple yet, the tail will shrink by one segment each time.

So when moving DOWN from (0,2) to (0,1), the body becomes [(6,4), (5,4), ..., (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)], and the new head is at (0,1). So the tail would be removed, making the body now 8 cells (since we added one cell but didn't eat apple yet).

Wait, initial body has 8 cells. After moving once without eating apple, the body remains 8, because the tail doesn't shrink. Wait no—the snake's body moves each step: the head moves, and each body segment follows. So if you don't eat an apple, the tail is removed after each move.

Wait, looking back at movement rules:

After eating the apple, the tail doesn't shrink on next move. Otherwise, it does. So when moving normally (without eating apple), the tail shrinks. Therefore, each step without eating apple reduces body length by 1. But in this case, initial body is 8 cells, including from (6,4) to (1,2). After moving once, the head becomes (0,1), and the body would be [(6,4), ..., (1,2), (0,2)], but without the tail? Or does it follow?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The snake's movement is as follows: when moving, the new head is added at the direction of movement, and each body segment moves into the position of the previous one. If an apple is eaten, the tail doesn't move (i.e., the body grows by adding the new head without losing the tail). Otherwise, the tail is removed.

So in this case, since we're moving towards the apple but haven't yet eaten it, each movement will cause the snake's body to shift, with the tail being cut off unless an apple was just eaten.

Therefore, when moving from (0,2) down to (0,1), the new head is at (0,1). The old head (0,2) becomes part of the body, and the previous tail (6,4) would be removed if not eating an apple. Wait no—the body is a list of cells excluding the head.

Wait, initial body is [(6,4), (5,4), ..., (1,2)]. So when moving to (0,1), the new head is at (0,1). The body becomes [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)], but then since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (6,4) is removed. So the body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), ..., (1,2), (0,2)].

So after moving DOWN once, the head is at (0,1). The body now includes cells from (5,4) down to (0,2).

Is the new head position (0,1) safe? Yes, because before the move, it's not in the original body. After the move, the body includes (0,2), but (0,1) is only the new head.

Wait, no—the new body will include all previous cells except the tail. So when moving DOWN, the new head is at (0,1). The old head (0,2) becomes part of the body as the first segment, and the tail is removed if not eating apple. But since we didn't eat the apple yet, the tail is cut.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to approach this step by step.

First, let's consider possible initial moves from (0,2). Current direction is LEFT, so first move can't be RIGHT. So options are UP or DOWN.

Option 1: Move DOWN to (0,1).

Check if that position is safe:

- Is (0,1) in the body? Original body is [(6,4), ... , (1,2)]. No, because all these have x >=1 except for (1,2). Wait, no—the original body includes (1,2), but not (0,1). So moving down to (0,1) is safe.

But after moving, the new head is at (0,1), and the old head becomes part of the body. The next move has to consider that (0,2) is now a body cell.

So from (0,1), what can we do? Next direction must not reverse.

Current direction after first move: since initial was LEFT, and first move is DOWN, so new direction is DOWN. So next moves can't be UP.

Wait no—current direction changes based on the movement made. So if I first move DOWN from LEFT, then the new direction is DOWN. Therefore, the next move can't be UP.

But wait, after moving DOWN, the current direction becomes DOWN. So for the next step, we can't reverse that direction (i.e., can't go UP).

So from (0,1), possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT, but with constraints:

- Can't go UP because last was DOWN.

Wait no—the movement rule is you can't reverse direction. So if moving DOWN now, the next move can't be UP.

But wait, after first move DOWN, current direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP.

So from (0,1), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If we go DOWN again, to (0,0). But is that safe? Let's see:

After moving to (0,0), the new head would be there. The body cells after first move include (5,4) down to (0,2). So (0,1) was just vacated by the previous step.

Wait no—after moving from (0,2) down to (0,1), the old head is now part of the body. Then, moving again DOWN would take us to (0,0), which isn't in any part of the body yet.

But then we're further away from the apple at (7,1). So maybe not the best path.

Alternatively, from (0,1), move RIGHT towards increasing x.

So first move: DOWN → (0,1)

Second move: can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. But moving RIGHT would take us to (1,1). Is that safe?

After second move:

If we go RIGHT to (1,1):

The body after first move is [(5,4), (4,4), ..., (0,2)]. So (1,1) isn't in the body yet. But wait, after moving again, the new head is at (1,1). The old head (0,1) becomes part of the body.

So now, the body includes [(5,4), (4,4), ..., (0,2)], and then (0,1) as the next segment. So the new body is from (5,4) to (0,2) and (0,1).

So from (1,1), we can move further right.

Wait, but each time we make a move without eating an apple, the tail is cut off. So after two moves, the initial tail segments are being removed.

But this might complicate tracking. Maybe it's better to simulate the path.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first isn't optimal because it takes us away from the apple's x-coordinate. The apple is at (7,1), which has a high x value. So perhaps we should go in the direction of increasing x.

But initial options are limited due to current direction constraints.

Wait, another option for the first move: instead of moving DOWN, maybe move UP.

From (0,2) → UP → (0,3). Is that safe? The body doesn't include (0,3), so yes. Then from (0,3), can we start moving right towards 7?

But then, again, the path would be longer because x needs to go up from 0 to 7.

Alternatively, maybe a combination of moving down once and then right multiple times.

Wait, let's outline a possible path:

1. Move DOWN to (0,1) – safe.
2. Then move RIGHT repeatedly towards (7,1). Each step must check for body collisions.

But each time we move RIGHT, the x increases by 1, y remains 1. So after moving right once: (1,1).

After that, next move right to (2,1), etc., until reaching (7,1).

But we have to ensure that in each step, the new head position is not in the current body.

However, as we make these moves, the body is shifting and tail is being cut off. So let's simulate a few steps.

Initial state:

Head: (0,2)

Body: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)]

First move: DOWN → (0,1). Direction is now DOWN.

After move 1:

Head: (0,1)

Body: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)] – since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (6,4) is cut off.

Second move: RIGHT → (1,1). New direction is RIGHT. Can't go LEFT now because it would reverse previous movement? Wait, no—reversing isn't allowed only when you're going in the opposite direction of last step.

Wait, movement rule is that you can't reverse direction immediately. So if I moved DOWN first, then direction is DOWN. Next move to RIGHT: is that a reversal?

No, because direction is about the previous movement. So after moving DOWN (direction: DOWN), next moves can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

Wait no—if you're currently moving in one direction, you cannot reverse it. For example, if you were moving right and then try to move left, that's reversing, which is not allowed.

So the rule is that you cannot make a 180-degree turn from the previous direction. So if I moved DOWN, next can't be UP. But other directions are allowed.

Therefore, in this case:

After first move (DOWN), direction is DOWN. Next moves can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

So moving RIGHT after DOWN is fine because it's not a reversal.

So second move: RIGHT to (1,1).

Now, check if (1,1) is safe. After first move, the body includes [(5,4), ..., (0,2)]. So (1,1) isn't part of the body yet.

After moving to (1,1):

Head: (1,1)

Body becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1)]

Because we moved again without eating an apple, the new body includes all previous segments except the tail.

Wait no—the initial body after first move was [(5,4), ..., (0,2)]. After moving RIGHT, the new head is at (1,1). The old head (0,1) becomes part of the body. So the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), ..., (0,2)] plus (0,1), but since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (5,4) is cut off.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think differently: each move adds a new head and removes the tail if no apple was eaten.

So after first move (DOWN to 0,1):

- New head: (0,1)
- Old head (0,2) becomes part of body
- Tail (6,4) is removed

Body now: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)]

Wait no—that can't be right. Because when you move, the body follows. So all existing body cells shift forward: each cell moves to where the previous one was.

So after moving from (0,2) DOWN to (0,1):

- New head is at (0,1)
- Previous head (0,2) becomes next in line
- The rest of the body shifts accordingly

Therefore, the new body list would be [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)]

So yes, after first move, body is as above.

Then, moving RIGHT to (1,1):

- New head: (1,1)
- Previous head (0,1) becomes part of the body
- The rest shifts accordingly

Therefore, new body list would be [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1)]

Because we didn't eat an apple, so the tail (5,4) is removed.

Now, from (1,1), direction is RIGHT. So next move can be LEFT, but that would reverse. Wait no—if current direction is RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT because it's a reversal.

Wait, movement rule: you cannot make a 180-degree turn. So if moving right, next moves can't be left.

So from (1,1), after moving right, the direction becomes RIGHT, so next possible moves are DOWN or UP? Or is it that as long as it's not the opposite direction?

Wait no—the rule is about immediately reversing direction. So if you were going in one direction, you can't switch to the opposite.

So for example:

- If last move was right, next can't be left.

Similarly,

- Last move down: next can't be up.

Therefore, from (1,1), which came after a RIGHT move from (0,1):

Wait no—the movement was first DOWN then RIGHT. So current direction is RIGHT.

So next moves can't be LEFT.

Thus, from (1,1), possible directions are UP or DOWN or continue RIGHT.

But in this case, we're trying to reach (7,1). So perhaps moving further right is the best option.

Third move: RIGHT → (2,1)

Check if (2,1) is safe. The current body includes [(3,4), ..., (0,1)]. No conflict, so it's safe.

After this move:

Head: (2,1)

Body becomes [(3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1)]

Wait no—the body shifts again. When moving from (1,1) to (2,1):

- New head: (2,1)
- Previous head (1,1) becomes part of the body
- The rest shifts

So new body list is [(3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1)]

Again, since we didn't eat an apple, tail (4,4) is cut off.

Wait no—wait. After first move, the body was [(5,4), ..., (0,2)]. Then moving to (0,1): body becomes [(5,4)...(0,2)] but shifted.

This is getting too complicated to track each step.

Perhaps another approach: find a path that allows movement rightwards without hitting any part of the body. Since the apple is at (7,1), which is directly south-east from current head.

But maybe it's better to move down once to (0,1) and then all the way right. But we need to ensure that none of these positions are in the body after each step.

Alternatively, perhaps a different initial approach: instead of moving DOWN first, move UP.

First move: UP from (0,2) → (0,3). Safe?

Yes, because original body doesn't include (0,3).

After this move:

Head: (0,3)

Body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), ..., (1,2)] plus (0,2), but since we didn't eat an apple, tail is cut. So new body list is [(5,4)...(1,2)], and head is at (0,3).

But wait, original body was [(6,4), ..., (1,2)]. Moving UP adds a new head and removes the tail.

So after first move:

Head: (0,3)

Body: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)]

Now, from (0,3), we can move right or left or down.

But our target is (7,1), which is south-east. So perhaps moving right and then down later?

Alternatively, but it's unclear.

This seems too time-consuming to simulate step-by-step without a visual. Maybe there's a pattern or formula to determine the shortest path avoiding body segments.

But given the complexity, perhaps the answer is that such a move isn't possible because the snake would collide with its own body before reaching the apple. However, since the problem statement implies that the apple is reachable, maybe it's possible.

Wait, but I'm supposed to imagine as a human, so let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Move DOWN to (0,1)
2. Move RIGHT 7 times to reach (7,1), eating the apple at each step? No, wait—the apple is just one position.

Wait no, in reality, when you move over the apple's position, you eat it and grow longer.

But in this case, since we only have one apple, moving into (7,1) would end the game if that's where the apple is.

So assuming the snake can navigate to (7,1) without hitting its body, which requires planning a path.

Another idea: Since the snake starts at (0,2), and needs to get to (7,1). The straight-line distance isn't blocked by the body as it moves. But wait, the body is in positions [(6,4), (5,4)...(1,2)], which are above the target.

So perhaps moving DOWN once, then RIGHT 7 times would work. Let's see:

- Move DOWN to (0,1): safe.
- Then move RIGHT seven times: each step must be checked.

After first move right to (1,1): body is now [(5,4), ..., (0,2)] shifted with new head at (1,1). So no collision.

Second move right to (2,1): same logic, safe.

Third to (3,1): safe.

Fourth to (4,1): safe.

Fifth to (5,1): safe.

Sixth to (6,1): safe.

Seventh to (7,1): eat apple. Success.

But wait, does the body ever come down to y=1? Let's see:

After first move: head at (0,1). Body includes [(5,4)...(0,2)]. So in subsequent moves, as the snake moves right, the body segments shift but stay above y=1. Therefore, moving right along y=1 is safe.

So yes, this path should work.
</think>

To solve the problem of navigating the snake from its starting position to the apple's location without colliding with its own body, we can follow a strategic path. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Move Down**: The snake starts at (0,2). Moving down once will take it to (0,1), which is safe as this position isn't occupied by any part of the body.
   
2. **Move Right Repeatedly**: From (0,1), the snake can move right seven times to reach the apple at (7,1). Each move right shifts the snake's position while keeping all body segments above y=1, ensuring no collision occurs.

This path ensures that the snake reaches the apple without hitting its own body.

**Answer:** The snake can move down once and then right seven times to safely reach the apple. The final step is \boxed{(7,1)}.
