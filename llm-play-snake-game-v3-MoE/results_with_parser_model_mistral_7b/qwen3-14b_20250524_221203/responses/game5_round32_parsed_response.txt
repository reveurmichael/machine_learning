{"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at position (8, 3). To reach the apple at position (1, 4), it needs to move horizontally towards the apple's x-coordinate and then vertically up. The Manhattan distance between the starting point and the apple is 8, so we need at least 8 moves. Here, we have constructed a path that moves the snake left 7 times and then up once without colliding with its own body."}
