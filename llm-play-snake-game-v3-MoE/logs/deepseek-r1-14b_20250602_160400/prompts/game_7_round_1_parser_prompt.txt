========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is currently at (5,5) with no body segments, so it's just the head and nothing else. The apple is at (5,8), which is three units up from the head.

First, I need to figure out how to get from (5,5) to (5,8). Since the snake has no body right now, it can move directly towards the apple without worrying about collisions with its own body. The goal is to move upwards because the y-coordinate needs to increase by 3.

The movement rules say that on each turn, if the new head position doesn't collide and is within bounds, the snake moves. Since the initial direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed. So I can start moving up.

Let's plan the moves:
1. First move: UP to (5,6)
2. Second move: UP to (5,7)
3. Third move: UP to (5,8), which is where the apple is.

Now, each of these moves needs to be checked for collisions. Since there are no body segments initially, moving up three times should be safe. Once the snake reaches the apple, it will grow by one segment because the body doesn't get removed when eating.

However, after eating, I need to ensure that at least one legal move remains for the next turn. If the snake is now two units long (head + one body), moving upwards again might cause a collision with the new body segment. So, I should avoid moving up once more and instead look for alternative directions, but since the problem only asks for the moves to reach the apple, I don't need to plan beyond that.

So the safe path is three UP moves.
</think>

{
  "moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,5) with no body segments and needs to move up three times to reach the apple at (5,8). Each move is safe as there are no collisions possible."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
