Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where I need to plan a safe path for the snake's head from (3,3) to eat the apple at (2,0). Let me break down the situation and figure out how to approach this.

First, let's visualize the grid. The head is at (3,3), which is near the bottom-left part of the 10x10 grid. The apple is at (2,0), so it's further to the left on the same row as the head but almost at the edge of the grid. The current direction is "LEFT," which means the snake can move towards increasing x values.

Looking at the body cells provided: [(4,3), (5,3)]. Wait, that seems a bit off because if the head is at (3,3), then moving left would take it to (2,3). But here, the body segments are at (4,3) and (5,3), which are actually to the right of the head. That suggests that the snake might be moving in a different direction initially or perhaps has turned.

But according to the problem statement, the body cells list starts from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the head is at (3,3) and the next body cell is at (4,3), that implies the snake was moving right before. But currently, the direction is "LEFT," which would take it towards lower x-values.

Wait, this seems conflicting. If the snake's body cells are [(4,3), (5,3)], then from the head at (3,3), it moved to the right twice to get to those positions. But now the current direction is "LEFT," which is a reversal of the previous movement. Hmm, that might be an issue.

The problem mentions that you cannot reverse directions on the first move if the current direction is not NONE. So since the initial direction after any move can't be reversed unless it's the first move and the current direction is NONE.

Wait, no. The rules say that if the current direction is "UP," you may not choose "DOWN" next, similarly for "LEFT" and "RIGHT." And if the current direction is "NONE," any first move is allowed. So in this case, the snake's head is at (3,3), with body cells to its right, meaning it was moving right before. Now the direction is "LEFT," which would be a reversal.

But wait, the initial direction given is "LEFT." So perhaps the snake hasn't moved yet, and the body cells are from a previous state where it was moving right, but now the direction is left. That might complicate things because reversing directions could lead to immediate death if not handled correctly.

So, starting at (3,3), with direction "LEFT," the next move would be to (2,3). But looking at the body cells, there's a cell at (4,3) and (5,3). So after moving left, the new head is at (2,3), which doesn't collide with any body cells because they're on the right side. Then, the snake would insert the old head (3,3) into the body list as the first segment.

Now, checking for collisions: since (2,3) isn't occupied by any body cell except possibly after insertion. Wait, no, before moving, the body cells are [(4,3), (5,3)], so they don't interfere with the new head position at (2,3). So that move is safe.

After moving to (2,3), if the snake eats the apple at (2,0), it would grow. But wait, the apple is at (2,0), which is on the same x as the new head but on y=0, so it's two units down. So after eating, the snake's body would grow by one segment, not removing the tail.

But I need to ensure that after eating, there's still a way for the snake to move next turn. Otherwise, it could get trapped.

So, let me outline possible steps:

1. Initial state: head at (3,3), direction left.
2. Move left to (2,3). Check if this is safe. Since body cells are on the right, no collision. So now, the new head is (2,3).
3. Insert old head (3,3) into the body list as the first segment. Body becomes [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)].
4. Check if new head is at apple position: (2,3) vs (2,0). No, so move normally.
5. Remove the tail (which was 5,3 now?), wait no—the body list after insertion would be [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2], and then we remove the last element to maintain length unless we ate the apple.

Wait, in the movement rules: if new_head is not equal to apple, move normally by removing the tail. So after moving left, since it didn't eat the apple, the body list would be [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] and then we remove the last element (5,3), making the body list [(3,3), (4,3)]. The head is now at (2,3).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because if you have body cells after moving left, you need to shift them. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no: when you move, you insert the old head into the front of the body list and then remove the tail unless you ate the apple. So in this case, since it's not an apple, we remove the tail (5,3), so the new body list is [ (3,3), (4,3) ].

Now, the snake is at head (2,3), with body segments at (3,3) and (4,3). So the next move could be left again to (1,3).

Continuing this way, moving left towards the apple. But the apple is at (2,0), which requires going down.

So perhaps after moving left a couple of times, I can start moving down.

Let me try mapping out possible moves step by step:

Move 1: LEFT → head at (2,3). Body becomes [ (3,3), (4,3) ]. Tail removed, so body is [ (3,3), (4,3) ].
But wait, the tail was (5,3), which is now removed, making the new body list [(3,3), (4,3)].

Move 2: LEFT → head at (1,3). Body becomes [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] after inserting old head (2,3), then remove tail (4,3) because not eating apple. So body list is [(2,3), (3,3)].

Move 3: LEFT → head at (0,3). Now, trying to move left from x=1 would take it to x=0, which is the edge of the grid. Is that allowed? Yes, but I need to check if moving there is safe.

But after moving to (0,3), the next step would be to see if I can start moving down towards (2,0). However, the snake's body is now at [(1,3), (2,3)], so moving down from (0,3) could lead into body cells unless managed correctly.

Wait, but after each move, the snake's body shifts forward. So maybe a better approach is to plan a path that navigates around the body without colliding.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider reversing direction once I get closer to the apple to start moving down.

But according to the rules, I can't reverse directions unless it's allowed by the movement rules. Since the initial direction was "LEFT," which restricts me from turning around immediately.

Wait, no: the rule says you cannot reverse if the current direction is not NONE. So if the current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. But what about changing direction to DOWN?

Yes, because LEFT and DOWN are different directions; there's no restriction against moving down after moving left. So from (0,3), I can start moving down towards y=2, etc.

So perhaps a path could be:

1. Move left twice to reach x=0.
2. Then move down towards the apple at (2,0).
But wait, that would require moving right again when at x=0, which is allowed because direction was LEFT, and next move can't be RIGHT unless it's after some time.

Wait no: if current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT as the next move. So from x=0,3, with direction LEFT, I can't move right immediately. That might complicate things because to get back towards (2,0), I need to eventually turn down and then maybe right.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path would be:

1. Move left twice to reach (0,3).
2. Then move down three times to reach y=0 at (0,0).
But wait, the apple is at (2,0). So that's not directly helpful.

Wait, no: if I'm at (0,3) and start moving down, each move decreases y by 1. So from (0,3), moving down would take me to (0,2), then (0,1), then (0,0). But the apple is at (2,0), so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving left twice, I need to change direction to DOWN and then RIGHT.

But to move right again, I have to ensure that I'm no longer restricted by the previous direction. Since the last move was LEFT, I can't immediately turn to RIGHT, but I can after that.

So perhaps:

1. Move left twice: (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3).
2. Then move down once to (1,2).
3. Then move right once to (2,2), which is allowed because the previous direction was DOWN.
4. Then move down again to (2,1).
5. Then move right to (3,1), and so on towards (2,0).

But this seems convoluted and might run into body cells.

Wait, but after each move, the snake's body shifts forward. So if I start moving left, then down, then right, the body can clear out, allowing for safe passage.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient path is:

1. Move left twice to reach (0,3).
2. Then move down four times: (0,3) → (0,2) → (0,1) → (0,0). But that's not helpful for reaching (2,0).

Wait, no. I need to go from y=3 to y=0, but also x needs to be 2.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving left twice, turn down and then right towards the apple.

Let me think:

- At (1,3), with body cells at [(3,3), (4,3)], maybe it's possible to start moving down.
But wait, if I'm at (1,3) with direction LEFT, I can't move right immediately. So perhaps after moving left twice, I need to adjust.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to map out the possible moves step by step, considering the body cells and ensuring that no collision occurs.

Let me attempt this:

Initial state:
- Head: (3,3)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body: [(4,3), (5,3)]

Move 1: LEFT → head at (2,3). Insert old head into body list: [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ]. Remove tail (5,3): new body is [ (3,3), (4,3) ].

State after move 1:
- Head: (2,3)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body: [(3,3), (4,3)]

Move 2: LEFT → head at (1,3). Insert old head: [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]. Remove tail (4,3): new body is [ (2,3), (3,3) ].

State after move 2:
- Head: (1,3)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body: [(2,3), (3,3)]

Move 3: LEFT → head at (0,3). Insert old head: [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) ]. Remove tail (3,3): new body is [ (1,3), (2,3) ].

State after move 3:
- Head: (0,3)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body: [(1,3), (2,3)]

Now at x=0, I can't go left anymore. So next move must be either down or right? Wait, no: direction is still LEFT, but moving left from x=0 isn't possible. So perhaps the snake has to change direction.

Wait, according to movement rules, if you try to move in a direction that's blocked (e.g., trying to go left from x=0), does it result in an inability to move? Or can it turn down instead?

I think in such cases, the snake must choose another direction. Since current direction is LEFT and it's at x=0, it cannot move further left. So perhaps it can change direction to DOWN.

So Move 4: CHANGE DIRECTION TO DOWN.

But wait, does that count as a new move? Or can it just decide to go down?

Assuming that changing direction counts as a move, then:

Move 4: DOWN → head at (0,2). Insert old head (0,3) into body list: [ (1,3), (2,3), (0,3) ]. Then remove tail (2,3): new body is [ (1,3), (0,3) ].

State after move 4:
- Head: (0,2)
- Direction: DOWN
- Body: [(1,3), (0,3)]

Now, the snake is at (0,2). Next move can be down again or right (since direction is now DOWN).

Move 5: DOWN → head at (0,1). Insert old head (0,2) into body list: [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,2) ]. Remove tail (0,3): new body is [ (1,3), (0,2) ].

State after move 5:
- Head: (0,1)
- Direction: DOWN
- Body: [(1,3), (0,2)]

Move 6: DOWN → head at (0,0). Insert old head (0,1) into body list: [ (1,3), (0,2), (0,1) ]. Remove tail (0,2): new body is [ (1,3), (0,1) ].

State after move 6:
- Head: (0,0)
- Direction: DOWN
- Body: [(1,3), (0,1)]

Now, at y=0, trying to move down further would take it out of the grid. So perhaps change direction again to RIGHT.

Move 7: CHANGE DIRECTION TO RIGHT → head can't move right from x=0? Or is that allowed?

Wait, no: x starts from 0, moving right would increase x by 1 to (1,0). Is that possible?

Yes, since at (0,0), trying to move right is possible. So:

Move 7: RIGHT → head at (1,0). Insert old head (0,0) into body list: [ (1,3), (0,1), (0,0) ]. Remove tail (0,1): new body is [ (1,3), (0,0) ].

State after move 7:
- Head: (1,0)
- Direction: RIGHT
- Body: [(1,3), (0,0)]

But the apple is at (2,0). So now, from (1,0), if we can continue moving right:

Move 8: RIGHT → head at (2,0). Insert old head (1,0) into body list: [ (1,3), (0,0), (1,0) ]. Remove tail (0,0): new body is [ (1,3), (1,0) ].

State after move 8:
- Head: (2,0)
- Direction: RIGHT
- Body: [(1,3), (1,0)]

Now, the snake has reached the apple at (2,0). So upon eating it, the snake grows by one segment without removing the tail.

So, since we ate the apple:

- Insert old head into body list: [ (2,0) ] + existing body [ (1,3), (1,0) ] = [ (2,0), (1,3), (1,0) ]
- Then, since we ate the apple, do not remove the tail. So final body is [ (2,0), (1,3), (1,0) ]

But wait, the movement rules say that after moving and eating, you keep the body as is, so no removal.

Thus, the snake's new state is:

- Head: (2,0)
- Direction: RIGHT
- Body: [(2,0), (1,3), (1,0)]

Now, we've successfully eaten the apple. But we need to ensure that in subsequent moves, there's a path that doesn't lead into the body cells.

From (2,0), moving right would take it to (3,0). But let's see:

Move 9: RIGHT → head at (3,0). Insert old head (2,0) into body list: [ (1,3), (1,0), (2,0) ] + [ (3,0) inserted as the new head ]. Wait, no—after eating, the snake's body becomes [ (2,0), (1,3), (1,0) ], and moving right would insert (2,0) into the front and then add (3,0). Then remove the tail? No—if we didn't eat, but in this case, we did. So perhaps after eating, each subsequent move just continues normally without removing.

Wait, no: upon eating, you only don't remove the tail for that particular move. After that, moves continue as usual—insert and then remove unless another apple is eaten.

But in our case, since we've already eaten the apple at (2,0), further moves would proceed as normal. So moving right from (2,0):

- Insert old head into body list: [ (2,0) ] + [ (1,3), (1,0) ] = [ (2,0), (1,3), (1,0) ]
- Then move right to (3,0). Now, the new state is:

- Head: (3,0)
- Body: [(2,0), (1,3), (1,0)]

But this might not be necessary since we've already achieved eating the apple. However, the problem only requires reaching and eating the apple, so perhaps that's sufficient.

But to make sure, let me check if the path is correct.

Alternative approach: instead of moving all the way left first, perhaps find a path that directly approaches the apple while avoiding body cells.

Starting from (3,3), with body [(4,3), (5,3)].

Move 1: LEFT → (2,3). Body becomes [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] minus (5,3): [(3,3), (4,3)]

Move 2: DOWN → (2,2). Insert old head (2,3) into body, so body becomes [(3,3), (4,3), (2,3)]. Then remove tail (4,3): body is [(3,3), (2,3)].

Move 3: RIGHT → (3,2). Insert (2,2) into body: [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ]. Remove tail (2,3): new body [(3,3), (2,2)]

Wait, this might not be the best path.

Alternatively:

Move 1: LEFT → (2,3). Body [(3,3), (4,3)]

Move 2: DOWN → (2,2). Body [(3,3), (4,3), (2,3)] minus (5,3) but wait, after move 1, body was [(3,3), (4,3)], then moving down would insert (2,3) and keep or remove?

Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial plan.

After several attempts, I think the key is to maneuver around the body cells by turning down and then right, as initially planned. So the path would involve:

1. Moving left twice to reach x=0.
2. Then moving down four times to reach y=0.
3. Then move right once to (2,0) where the apple is.

Thus, total moves: 3 left + 4 down + 1 right = 8 moves.

But let's count:

From (3,3):

1. LEFT → (2,3)
2. LEFT → (1,3)
3. LEFT → (0,3)

Then,

4. DOWN → (0,2)
5. DOWN → (0,1)
6. DOWN → (0,0)

Then,

7. RIGHT → (1,0)
8. RIGHT → (2,0)

So yes, 8 moves.

Therefore, the shortest path is 8 moves.
</think>

The shortest path to reach and eat the apple requires moving left twice, then down four times, followed by right two times, totaling eight moves.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** (3,3)
2. **Move Left:** To (2,3)
3. **Move Left:** To (1,3)
4. **Move Left:** To (0,3)
5. **Move Down:** To (0,2)
6. **Move Down:** To (0,1)
7. **Move Down:** To (0,0)
8. **Move Right:** To (1,0)
9. **Move Right:** To (2,0)

Upon reaching (2,0), the snake eats the apple, completing the goal in 8 moves.

**Answer:** The shortest path requires 8 moves.
