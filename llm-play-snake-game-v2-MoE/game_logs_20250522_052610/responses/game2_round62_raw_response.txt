========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The snake is at (6,6) and needs to get to the apple at (5,2). The current direction is RIGHT, but the first move can't be the opposite direction since it would reverse. So, from RIGHT, I can't go LEFT next.

Looking at the body cells: [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. The snake is currently moving towards the right, but its body is extending upwards and then turning left a bit. I need to make sure that any move I plan doesn't cause the head to collide with these body parts.

The apple is at (5,2). From (6,6) to (5,2), the x decreases by 1, so we'll need one more LEFT than RIGHT. The y decreases by 4, so we'll need four more DOWNs than UPs.

First move options: Since current direction is RIGHT, and can't reverse, I can go UP or DOWN, but maybe even LEFT if it's safe. But wait, moving LEFT from (6,6) would take me to (5,6), which is the same as the last body cell before the head. So that's not allowed because it would collide.

So possible first moves are UP or DOWN.

Let me check each possibility.

Option 1: Move UP. New head position would be (6,7). Then, after moving, the body shifts. The new tail is added only if we eat an apple, but initially, without eating, the tail shrinks. Wait no—the snake moves by adding the new head and removing the tail unless it eats.

Wait, per movement rules: when you move, the head becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed unless the apple was eaten. So in this case, since we're not eating an apple on the first move, after moving, the snake's body will be [(6,7), (6,9), (5,9), ..., (5,6)], but wait no—the initial body cells are given as part of the current state. Hmm.

Wait, the head is at (6,6), and the body is [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. So if we move UP to (6,7), then the new body would be [ (6,7) ] + all previous body cells except the tail. Wait no: when you move, the head moves, and each body cell follows the one in front of it. The tail is removed unless apple is eaten.

So if I move UP to (6,7), then the new body would be [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)] but shifted? Wait no—the head becomes the first element of the body. So after moving UP, the head is at (6,7). The previous head was (6,6), which becomes part of the body.

So new body would be [(6,7), (6,6), (5,9), ... , (5,6)]? No, that doesn't make sense because each segment follows the direction. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think step by step.

Current state: head is at (6,6). The body is [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].

When the snake moves in a direction, the head moves to new position. Then each segment of the body follows: each one moves into the previous position of the next segment. The tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So if we move UP from (6,6) to (6,7), then:

- New head is (6,7)
- Previous head (6,6) becomes part of the body
- So the new body list is [ (6,7), (6,6), ... ] but actually, each segment moves forward. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a queue: when moving, the head is added to the front, and if not eating, the last element is removed.

So after moving UP:

- New head: (6,7)
- Body becomes [ (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7) ] because we add (6,7) at front and remove the last element (5,6) since no apple is eaten.

Wait that might not be accurate. Let me think: initial body is [ (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6) ] and head at (6,6). So when the snake moves UP to (6,7):

- New head is (6,7)
- The body becomes [ (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7) ] but wait that can't be because the length would increase. No, in normal movement without eating apple, the tail is removed.

Wait no: initial body has 7 segments plus head? Or not. Wait, the body cells given are excluding the head. So initial state is:

- Head: (6,6)
- Body: [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]

So total length is 8 (head + 7 body cells). When moving without eating apple, the tail is removed. So after moving UP:

- New head: (6,7)
- Body becomes [ (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7) ] because we add new head to front and remove last element.

Wait, no—when you move, the body shifts. So each body cell moves into the position of the previous one.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model that when moving, the new head is added at the start of the body list, and if not eating apple, the last cell is removed.

So initial body: [ (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6) ]

After moving UP:

- new_head = (6,6) + direction vector for UP: (6, 7)
- body becomes [new_head] + body[:-1] if not eating apple.

Wait no—no. Because when you move, each body cell follows the head's movement. So it's more like a linked list where each node follows the previous.

This is getting complicated; perhaps I should think about whether moving UP first is safe.

If I move UP to (6,7), then check if that position is in the current body cells. The current body cells are [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. So (6,7) is not present, so moving UP would be safe.

So after moving UP to (6,7), the new body is [(6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7)]. Wait no—because when you move, each segment follows. So perhaps the body cells after moving would be:

- The head moves to (6,7)
- The previous head position (6,6) becomes part of the body
- Then, the next segments follow: (6,9), (5,9), etc.

Wait no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

When you move in a direction, the head moves to new_head = current_head + direction vector.

Then, each body segment moves into the position of the previous segment. The tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

So for example:

Original positions: head (6,6), body cells [ (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6) ]

After moving UP to (6,7):

- New head is (6,7)
- The old head (6,6) becomes the first body cell
- Then each body cell moves: (6,9) moves to (6,6)'s position? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving, all segments shift forward. So:

After moving UP:

New head is at (6,7)

The next segment was at (5,9). Wait no—the body list is [(6,9), (5,9), ...]. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think that when you move the head, each body cell follows the path of the previous one.

So after moving UP:

The new body cells would be [(6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7)], but only if no apple is eaten. Wait, because without eating, we lose the tail.

Wait that can't be right, because the length remains same. The snake's body length is fixed unless it eats an apple. So when moving normally, you add new head and remove tail to keep the same length.

So in this case:

After moving UP from (6,6) to (6,7), the new body would be [ (6,7) ] + original_body[:-1], which is [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7)].

Wait no—original_body is 7 cells. After moving, we add new head and remove last cell: so the body becomes [ (6,7) ] + original_body[:-1], which would be length 7 again.

So the new body is [(6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7)].

Wait but that doesn't make sense because (6,9) was already a body cell. So in this case, moving to (6,7) is okay because it's not colliding with the current body except perhaps itself after moving.

But wait, after moving, the head is at (6,7), and the body cells include (5,7). So no collision there.

Okay, so moving UP first seems safe. Now, what's next?

From (6,7), possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT—since current direction was RIGHT, but we moved UP, which was a change in direction. Next move can't be opposite of current direction if it changes again? Wait no—the rules say you cannot reverse direction. So if the previous direction was RIGHT and I moved UP (which is a 90-degree turn), then next moves can't go DOWN because that would be reversing from UP. Or wait, does the rule mean that if you were going in direction D, your next move can't be opposite of D? Like if you're moving UP, next can't be DOWN.

Wait the rules say: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If direction is NONE, any move allowed. So after each move, the new direction becomes the one chosen, and the next move can't be opposite of that.

So in this case, first move was UP from RIGHT; now current direction is UP, so next move can't be DOWN.

So after moving UP to (6,7), direction is now UP. Next moves cannot be DOWN.

Now, from (6,7), I need to plan the path towards (5,2). The apple is at (5,2).

But perhaps there's a better initial move than UP. Let me consider other options.

Wait the first possible move after RIGHT can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction, but wait no—the rule says you cannot reverse direction on the first move. Wait, original direction was RIGHT. So if you choose to go LEFT as the first move, is that allowed? Because it's reversing direction from RIGHT to LEFT.

Wait the constraint says: Must not reverse direction on the first move. So the first move can't be opposite of current direction. Current direction is RIGHT, so first move cannot be LEFT.

So possible first moves are UP or DOWN. As I considered before.

Let me think about moving DOWN first as an alternative.

If I move DOWN from (6,6), new head would be at (6,5). But wait, the body cells include (5,2) is the apple—no, wait the apple is at (5,2), which is not part of the body. So after moving DOWN to (6,5), I need to check if that's safe.

But let's see: current body is [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. Moving to (6,5) would be a new position not in the body, so it's safe.

Then, after moving DOWN to (6,5), direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP because that would reverse.

So from (6,5), I need to plan towards (5,2). That might involve more moves downwards and then leftwards.

But let me compare the two options: starting with UP or starting with DOWN.

If I start with UP:

- New head at (6,7)
- Body becomes [ (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7) ]

From there, moving towards the apple. The apple is at (5,2). So I need to go left one and down five.

If I start with DOWN:

- New head at (6,5)
- Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7) ]

Then, from there, I need to go left one and down five more steps.

Hmm. Not sure which is better yet.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT isn't possible on the first move because of the reversal constraint. So only UP or DOWN are options for first move.

Wait no—current direction is RIGHT; can I choose any other direction except LEFT as the first move? Yes, because LEFT would reverse from RIGHT, so it's prohibited on the first move.

So first move must be either UP or DOWN.

Back to moving UP first. After (6,7), next moves cannot be DOWN.

From (6,7):

Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, but not DOWN.

I need to go towards (5,2). So from (6,7), perhaps moving LEFT would make sense to reduce the x-coordinate.

If I move LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7).

Is that position safe? Current body after first move is [(6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7)]. So the new head would be at (5,7). Is (5,7) in the body? Looking at the list: yes, it's the last cell. So moving LEFT to (5,7) would cause collision with the tail.

Wait no—the tail is at (5,7), but after moving, the new head is added and the tail is removed. Wait no—if I'm moving without eating apple, then when you move, the head moves, and the tail is removed.

So in this case:

After first move: body is [(6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7)]

If I move LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7):

- New head is at (5,7)
- Body becomes [ (5,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) ]

Wait no—when you move, the new head is added, and the tail is removed.

So after moving LEFT to (5,7):

New body would be [(5,7)] + original_body[:-1], which was [ (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) ]

Wait no—original_body after first move is [ (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7) ]

So when moving to (5,7):

- new_head = (5,7)
- body becomes [new_head] + original_body[:-1], which would be [ (5,7), (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) ]

Wait that doesn't make sense because the positions are not following.

Alternatively, perhaps each body segment follows the previous one. So after moving LEFT to (5,7):

- The new head is at (5,7)
- The next segment was previously at (6,7), so it moves to (5,7)'s old position? Wait no, that's not right.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead consider that when you move LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7), the new head is there, and the body follows:

- The previous head at (6,7) becomes part of the body.
- Each subsequent segment moves forward.

So after moving LEFT:

Head: (5,7)
Body: [ (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) ]

Because the last cell is removed.

But in this case, the new head at (5,7) was previously the tail. So moving into that position would cause a collision because it's now part of the body.

Wait no—when you move, the new head is added, and the tail is removed if not eating apple. So after moving to (5,7), the old head (6,7) becomes part of the body, but the old tail at (5,7) is removed.

So the new body would be:

[ (5,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) ]

Wait that can't be right because you're losing cells. Wait no—when you move without eating, the snake's length remains same.

Original body after first move: 7 cells.

After moving again without eating, it should still have 7 cells.

So from (6,7):

- Move LEFT to (5,7)
- New head is (5,7)
- The previous head (6,7) becomes the new second cell
- The last cell (5,7) is removed

Wait but that would leave:

[ (5,7), (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) ]

But wait, (5,7) was the old tail; after moving, it's no longer part of the body.

Wait I'm getting really confused here. Maybe an alternative approach is better: when you move, all body cells follow the head, so their positions shift accordingly.

So if I'm at (6,7), and I move LEFT to (5,7):

- The new head is at (5,7)
- Each body cell moves to where the previous one was
- So the first body cell (6,9) moves to (6,7)
- Then (5,9) moves to (6,9)
- (4,9) moves to (5,9)
- (4,8) moves to (4,9)
- (5,8) moves to (4,8)
- And the last cell (5,7) is removed.

Wait that makes more sense. So after moving LEFT from (6,7), the new body would be:

[ (5,7), (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) ]

But wait, (5,7) is now the head, and the next cell is where (6,7) was. So no collision because none of these positions are overlapping.

So moving LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7) is safe.

Then, from (5,7), possible directions: DOWN, RIGHT—can't go UP as that would reverse direction from LEFT? Wait no—the current direction after the first move was UP, then we moved LEFT. So the current direction is now LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait wait, let's clarify:

First move: from (6,6) to (6,7)—direction becomes UP.

Second move: from (6,7) to (5,7)—direction becomes LEFT.

So third move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse the current direction of LEFT.

So possible directions: DOWN or something else? No—current direction is LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, but wait no—if you're moving in a direction (LEFT), your next move can't be opposite (RIGHT). But UP and DOWN are perpendicular, so they're allowed.

Wait no—the rule is that you can't reverse the immediate previous direction. So if I was going LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT. But you can go any other direction except the opposite of current direction.

So from (5,7) moving in direction LEFT, possible moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT? No—wait, the direction after moving LEFT is now LEFT. The next move can't be RIGHT.

But wait, in terms of grid movement, moving in a direction and then making a 90-degree turn is allowed as long as you're not reversing.

So from (5,7), after moving LEFT, current direction is LEFT. Next moves cannot be RIGHT; they can be UP or DOWN.

So from (5,7):

Possible moves: LEFT (further left to (4,7)), UP to (5,8), or DOWN to (5,6).

Let's see:

Option 1: Move LEFT again to (4,7). Then direction becomes LEFT.

But that might not be the most efficient path towards the apple at (5,2). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,6) could be better.

Wait the apple is at (5,2), which is directly below. So if I can get to row 2 in column 5, that's where the apple is.

From (5,7), if I move DOWN to (5,6):

- Check if (5,6) is safe.

Current body after second move: [ (5,7), (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) ]

So moving to (5,6): that position isn't in the current body except for the last cell before movement. Wait no—the tail is at (5,8). So (5,6) is safe.

After moving DOWN to (5,6):

- New head: (5,6)
- Body becomes [ (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8) ]

Because we add new head and remove the old tail.

So now, from (5,6), possible directions: can't go UP because that would reverse direction from DOWN.

Wait no—the current direction after moving DOWN is DOWN. So next move can't be UP.

But wait, movement direction changes based on where you move.

From (5,7), I moved DOWN to (5,6). Now the current direction is DOWN.

So next move can't be UP; possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But going further DOWN from (5,6) would take me closer to the apple at (5,2).

So let's try moving DOWN again to (5,5):

- Check if (5,5) is safe. Current body after third move is [ (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8) ]

So (5,5) is not in the body; it's safe.

After moving DOWN to (5,5):

- New head: (5,5)
- Body becomes [ (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9) ]

From here, current direction is DOWN; next move can't be UP.

Continue moving DOWN to (5,4):

- Safe? Current body: [ (5,5), ... ] So yes.

New head at (5,4).

Body becomes [ (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,9), (5,9) ]

Continue moving DOWN to (5,3):

- Safe? Yes.

Head at (5,3).

Body: [ (5,3), (5,4), ..., (5,9) ]

Then to (5,2)—the apple is here. So:

Move from (5,3) to (5,2):

Check if safe—yes, because body doesn't include (5,2) yet.

But wait—the apple is at (5,2). If I move there, do I eat it? Assuming yes, then the snake grows by one cell.

So after eating the apple:

- Head moves to (5,2)
- Body remains the same length; no cells are removed.

Wait no—when you eat food, you don't lose a tail. So if the snake was length 7 before moving into the apple, it becomes length 8.

But wait in our case, after each move without eating, the snake's body is adjusted by adding new head and removing old tail. When eating, the tail isn't removed.

So let me retrace:

After first four moves: from (6,6) to (6,7) [UP], then (5,7) [LEFT], then (5,6) [DOWN], then (5,5) [DOWN], then (5,4) [DOWN], then (5,3) [DOWN].

So sixth move is to (5,2). Since that's the apple's position, we eat it.

Thus:

- New head at (5,2)
- The body becomes [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,9) ]

Because we didn't remove the tail.

So now the snake has length 8.

But wait, was that efficient? Let's see:

Number of moves: 6. That seems a bit long, but it works.

Alternatively, maybe another path is shorter.

Alternative approach: After first move to (6,7), instead of moving LEFT, maybe move RIGHT to (7,7). Then continue down towards the apple.

But let's see:

After first move: (6,7)

Second move options: can't go DOWN because that would reverse from UP. So possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT.

Option: Move RIGHT to (7,7).

Then direction is RIGHT; next move can't be LEFT.

From (7,7):

Can move DOWN to (7,6), then (7,5), etc., but that's moving away from the apple at (5,2). Not efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps another path.

Wait maybe if I go down first instead of up. Let's try starting with DOWN:

First move: from (6,6) to (6,5) [DOWN].

Check safety—assuming it's clear.

Then direction is DOWN.

Next move can't be UP; possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If I go further DOWN to (6,4), then maybe turn left or right towards the apple.

But this might take more steps. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a square path to reach the apple.

But I think the first approach with 6 moves is acceptable, though there might be shorter paths.

Wait another idea: After (5,7), move DOWN twice to (5,5) and then LEFT or RIGHT? No, that seems longer.

Alternatively, from (5,7), move DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), but that might not help.

Hmm. It's a bit tricky, but I think the initial path is valid, albeit perhaps not the most optimal.

So in summary:

Moves:

1. RIGHT to (6,6) – wait no, starting at (6,6). First move must be UP or DOWN.

Wait wait—no: the snake starts at (6,6). The first move can't be LEFT because it would reverse from initial direction. Wait no—the initial direction isn't set yet. The first move is the first direction, so any of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are possible except for reversing? No, the first move has no previous direction to reverse.

Wait wait—no: in the initial state, before any moves, there's no current direction. So the first move can be any direction except... Wait the problem says that on the first step, you cannot reverse the initial direction. But what is the initial direction?

Ah, right—the initial direction is undefined, so the first move can be any of the four directions.

Wait no—the user wrote: "You are not allowed to make a move in the opposite direction of your previous move."

So for the first move, there's no previous move, so you can go any direction.

Therefore, I was mistaken earlier. The initial moves can choose any direction without restriction except for the next ones.

Wait but that changes things. So first move can be LEFT, UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought that on the first move, you couldn't reverse from RIGHT because the starting direction was RIGHT? No—the initial direction isn't set; it's after the first move that the current direction is established.

Therefore:

First move can be any of LEFT, UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

So for optimal path towards (5,2), perhaps moving DOWN first to get closer vertically.

Let me try:

1. Move DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5)

Current direction: DOWN

Body: [ (6,5) ]

Wait no—snake's body is a sequence; after the first move, the head moves, and the rest follows. But actually, at t=0, the snake is just at (6,6). After moving DOWN, it's now at (6,5), with the tail removed? Wait no—the snake grows as it eats, but initially, it's just the head.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial state. If the snake starts at (6,6) and moves to a new cell, does it leave the old cell empty or is it part of the body?

Assuming that when you move, the previous position becomes part of the body unless you eat food.

So starting at (6,6), after moving DOWN to (6,5), the body would be [ (6,5) ] and (6,6) is now empty? Or does it follow that each move adds a new head and removes the tail?

Wait in snake games, when you don't eat food, the head moves forward, and the tail follows by moving into the previous segment's space, effectively losing the last cell.

But since initially, the snake is one cell, after the first move, it would still be one cell because there's nowhere to remove from. So perhaps until the snake eats food, its length remains 1.

Wait no—that doesn't make sense. Usually, the snake grows when it eats food; otherwise, moving causes the tail to follow without growth.

So in this problem, I think that:

- The snake has a certain length (initially, likely 3 cells or something, but not specified here).

But since the user didn't specify the initial length, perhaps it's just the head at (6,6), and when you move, it doesn't have a body yet. But that seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the snake is of length 1 initially, so moving doesn't create a body until it eats food.

This is unclear, but given that the user didn't specify, perhaps we can assume that the snake has to navigate without growing, meaning that each move simply moves the head and the tail follows accordingly, but since there's no food mentioned except for the target at (5,2), maybe the path doesn't require considering body length as it grows only when eating.

But this is ambiguous. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the snake can be represented as a list of coordinates, starting with just the head, and each move adds a new head while removing the last tail unless food is eaten.

In this problem, since we're moving towards (5,2), which is the only food mentioned, perhaps it's a single-cell food. So upon reaching (5,2), the snake grows by one cell.

Therefore, initial state: [ (6,6) ]

After each move without eating, the snake becomes [new_head] + snake[:-1], effectively moving the body forward.

But when food is eaten at (5,2), the snake becomes [new_head] + snake, so it grows by one.

So let's model it that way.

Given that, let's try to find a path from (6,6) to (5,2):

1. Move DOWN to (6,5): snake is now [ (6,5), (6,6) ] but wait no—snake becomes [new_head] + snake[:-1], so since initial was [ (6,6) ], after moving DOWN, it's [ (6,5) ]. Wait that can't be; the tail would move.

Wait I'm confused. Let me clarify:

Each move step: head moves to new position. The body follows by each segment moving into the previous one's place. If food is not eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed. If food is eaten, the snake grows, so no segment is removed.

So for example:

- Start at t=0: [ (6,6) ]

t=1: move DOWN to (6,5). Since no food, tail (6,6) is removed? Or does it follow?

Wait no—the body follows. So the new head is at (6,5), and the previous position (6,6) becomes part of the body.

So snake becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

t=2: move DOWN to (6,4). Now, since no food, tail (6,6) is removed. So snake is [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Wait that's not how it works—each segment moves into the previous one's position.

So the movement is similar to a queue: new head is added, and if not growing, old tail is removed.

Thus:

- t=0: [ (6,6) ] (length 1)
- t=1: move DOWN → add (6,5). Since no food, remove tail → snake becomes [ (6,5) ]
- t=2: move DOWN → add (6,4). Remove tail → snake [ (6,4) ]

Wait that can't be right; the snake would just oscillate without growing. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving, each segment follows the previous one, and if no food is eaten, the last segment is lost.

But in this case, movement from (6,6):

t=0: [ (6,6) ]

t=1: move DOWN to (6,5). Now, since length was 1, after moving, it's still 1? Or does it become [ (6,5), (6,6) ] and then if no food, tail is removed.

Wait I think the correct model is:

- The snake is a list of coordinates representing its body.
- When you move in a direction, the new head is added to the front of the list.
- If the new head is on food, the tail remains; otherwise, the last element (tail) is removed to keep the length same.

So for example:

Start: [ (6,6) ]

Move DOWN → new head at (6,5). Since not on food, add it and remove tail? But initial length is 1; can't remove anything. So perhaps until the snake has more than one cell, moving doesn't change its length.

Wait that seems inconsistent with standard snake behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the snake starts with a certain length (like 3), but since it's not specified, I'll assume that movement without food keeps the length same by adding new head and removing tail.

Therefore:

t=0: [ (6,6) ]

Move DOWN to (6,5): add to front → [ (6,5), (6,6) ], then remove last if no food. Since no food, remove last → back to [ (6,5) ].

Wait that doesn't make sense; it would oscillate.

Alternatively, perhaps movement always adds a new head and only removes the tail when not on food. But this seems ambiguous without more information.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that each move allows the snake to move in any direction except the opposite of the previous move, and we need to find the shortest path from (6,6) to (5,2), considering possible turns but not worrying about body length as it's not specified.

Thus, treating it like a grid where you can move in four directions without restriction except that you cannot reverse direction immediately.

But wait, according to the problem statement: "You are not allowed to make a move in the opposite direction of your previous move."

So each subsequent move cannot be directly opposite the prior one. So after moving UP, next move can't be DOWN; after LEFT, can't go RIGHT; etc.

Therefore, for the shortest path from (6,6) to (5,2):

The straight-line distance is 1 unit down and 1 unit left: from (6,6) → (5,6) → (5,5). Wait no—target is (5,2), which is further.

Wait wait—the target is at (5,2), so it's 4 units to the left (from x=6 to x=5? No—it's from x=6 to x=5 is just 1 unit left. But y goes from 6 to 2—4 units down.

So total movement: 1 left and 4 down, but in any order.

But considering that each move can't be reversed immediately.

So possible path:

Move DOWN four times and then LEFT once. That would be five moves.

Is this allowed?

Let's see:

Start at (6,6)

1. Move DOWN to (6,5). Previous direction: DOWN

2. Next move cannot be UP. So again DOWN to (6,4). Now previous direction: DOWN

3. Again DOWN to (6,3). Previous direction: DOWN

4. Again DOWN to (6,2). Previous direction: DOWN

Now at (6,2), need to go LEFT to (5,2).

5. Move LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2). Since previous move was DOWN, LEFT is allowed.

So total moves: 5.

That's efficient.

But wait, can we do it in fewer moves? Let me think.

Alternatively:

1. LEFT from (6,6) → (5,6)

Previous direction: LEFT

2. Then cannot go RIGHT. So move DOWN to (5,5). Previous direction: DOWN

3. Then move DOWN again to (5,4), previous direction: DOWN

4. Again DOWN to (5,3)

5. Again DOWN to (5,2)

That's five moves as well.

Alternatively:

1. Move DOWN to (6,5)

2. Move LEFT to (5,5) [can't move UP since previous was DOWN]

Wait no—previous direction was DOWN; next move can't be UP or LEFT if it's the opposite? Wait no: moving LEFT after DOWN is allowed because they are perpendicular.

So:

1. DOWN → (6,5)

2. LEFT → (5,5)

3. DOWN → (5,4)

4. DOWN → (5,3)

5. DOWN → (5,2)

Again five moves.

Is there a way to do it in four?

Let me see: if we alternate directions smartly.

For example:

1. DOWN → (6,5) [prev: DOWN]

2. RIGHT → can't because previous was DOWN, so right is allowed (since opposite of LEFT would be RIGHT; but DOWN's opposite is UP). So moving RIGHT after DOWN is okay.

Wait no—the restriction is only on the direct opposite direction.

So after moving DOWN, next move cannot be UP. It can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

Therefore:

1. DOWN → (6,5)

2. RIGHT → (7,5) [prev: RIGHT]

3. DOWN → (7,4) [can't go LEFT since prev was RIGHT]

But this is moving away from the target.

Alternatively, after step 2, move DOWN again:

1. DOWN → (6,5)

2. RIGHT → (7,5)

3. DOWN → (7,4)

This seems not helpful.

Alternatively, let's try another path.

1. LEFT to (5,6) [prev: LEFT]

2. DOWN to (5,5) [can't go RIGHT since prev was LEFT? No—opposite of LEFT is RIGHT; so moving DOWN after LEFT is allowed.

3. DOWN to (5,4)

4. DOWN to (5,3)

5. DOWN to (5,2)

Again five moves.

Is four possible?

Suppose we do a diagonal-like move by turning:

But in grid movement, it's only orthogonal.

Wait another idea: If we can make two turns.

For example:

1. DOWN → (6,5) [prev: DOWN]

2. LEFT → (5,5) [allowed since prev was DOWN; opposite is UP]

3. DOWN → (5,4)

4. DOWN → (5,3)

But that's four moves from step 3 to target? Wait:

Wait after move 1: (6,5)

Move 2: LEFT → (5,5)

Move 3: DOWN → (5,4)

Move 4: DOWN → (5,3)

Move 5: DOWN → (5,2)

Nope, still five.

Alternatively, is there a way to combine some moves?

Wait maybe:

1. DOWN → (6,5) [prev: DOWN]

2. LEFT → (5,5) [allowed]

3. DOWN → (5,4) [prev: DOWN]

4. LEFT → can't because prev was DOWN; opposite of LEFT is RIGHT, so moving LEFT after DOWN is allowed.

Wait no—previous move was DOWN, which is perpendicular to LEFT, so it's allowed.

So:

1. DOWN → (6,5)

2. LEFT → (5,5)

3. DOWN → (5,4)

4. LEFT → (4,4) [now moving away from target]

Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 3, move DOWN again:

1. DOWN → (6,5)

2. LEFT → (5,5)

3. DOWN → (5,4)

4. DOWN → (5,3)

But still need to go down to (5,2), so fifth move.

Wait maybe another approach: since you can't reverse direction immediately, but after two moves, you can change directions again.

Let me try:

1. LEFT → (5,6) [prev: LEFT]

2. DOWN → (5,5) [allowed, as prev was LEFT; opposite is RIGHT]

3. DOWN → (5,4)

4. DOWN → (5,3)

5. DOWN → (5,2)

Again five moves.

Alternatively:

1. DOWN → (6,5)

2. LEFT → (5,5)

3. DOWN → (5,4)

4. DOWN → (5,3)

But same as before.

Wait maybe another path: move RIGHT first, then DOWN multiple times, but that would require more steps.

I think the minimal number of moves is five.

So the answer should be 5 moves.
</think>

The snake needs to move from (6,6) to (5,2). The shortest path involves moving down four times and left once, totaling five moves. Each move cannot be reversed immediately, but since these directions are perpendicular or same, it's allowed.

$\boxed{5}$
