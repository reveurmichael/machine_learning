========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to move the snake from (4,7) to the apple at (9,8). The current direction is RIGHT, and the body cells are [(3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]. 

First, I need to understand the movement rules. Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT, my next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction. So from RIGHT, I can choose UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

Looking at the head position (4,7) and the apple at (9,8), I see that the apple is 5 units to the right and 1 unit up. The Manhattan distance suggests moving mostly right with a little up movement. 

I should check if moving directly right is possible without hitting any body parts or walls. From (4,7), moving right would take me to (5,7). But I need to make sure that in the next steps, after each move, the snake's body doesn't block my path.

Wait, looking at the body cells: [(3,7), (3,6), ...]. The segment behind the head is (3,7) and (3,6). So moving right from (4,7) would lead to (5,7), which isn't occupied by any body part except possibly if the tail moves. But since the body segments are behind, after moving, the head becomes (5,7), and the body shifts accordingly.

I should also consider whether eating the apple will cause the snake to grow, so I need to make sure that after growing, there's still space for movement. 

Let me plan step by step:

1. Move RIGHT: From (4,7) to (5,7). Check collision: new head is within bounds and not in body except possibly tail which moves. Since the apple isn't here yet, this should be safe.

2. Next move could also be RIGHT again towards (6,7), and so on until I reach x=9. But wait, the apple is at y=8, which is higher than my current head's y=7. So I need to adjust the direction upwards once I'm near.

But moving directly right all the way might block me because as the snake grows, its body could interfere with future moves. Alternatively, maybe a slight detour up and then right would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps move RIGHT for five times: from (4,7) →5→6→7→8→9, which is 5 steps right, but I also need to adjust the y-coordinate by +1. So maybe after moving right four times, I can move UP once.

Wait, let me calculate the exact moves needed:

Current position: (4,7)
Apple at (9,8)

So delta x = 5, delta y = 1.

To achieve this, possible paths could be moving right 5 times and up once. But since movement is turn-based, I can't move diagonally, so I have to alternate between right and up.

But the snake's body will affect this because each move adds a new head position and removes the tail unless it eats an apple.

Wait, but initially, the body cells are [(3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]. So when I start moving right, the snake's body will shift accordingly. 

Let me simulate the first few moves:

1. Move RIGHT: new head is (5,7). The body becomes [(4,7), (3,7), ...] but since we're not eating an apple, the tail (4,4) will move to (4,3), so the body after this move would be [ (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ]? Wait no. The movement update rules say:

When moving normally (not eating apple):

a. Insert old head at front of BODY.

b. Remove tail.

So initial body is [B1, B2, B3, B4, T].

After moving right, new body becomes [old_head] + current_body[:-1]. So the new body after one move would be [(4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)] and the head is (5,7). 

So each move to the right adds a new segment in front but removes the tail. However, as I continue moving right, the body will follow.

But wait, if I keep moving right, the snake's body will form a straight line from (4,7) to (9,7), and then when I need to go up, the next move would be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps after reaching x=9 at y=7, I can move UP to 8. But I have to make sure that moving up doesn't hit any body part.

Let me plan:

Moves: RIGHT (5 times) → x becomes 4+5=9. Then, one UP.

But the initial direction is RIGHT, so the first move has to be RIGHT or any except LEFT? Wait no, current direction is RIGHT, and the next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse direction. So from RIGHT, I can choose UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

So for the first move, moving RIGHT is allowed.

Let's outline the moves:

1. Move RIGHT → (5,7)
2. Move RIGHT → (6,7)
3. Move RIGHT → (7,7)
4. Move RIGHT → (8,7)
5. Move RIGHT → (9,7)
6. Move UP → (9,8)

But wait, after the fifth move to the right, I'm at (9,7). Then moving up would take me to (9,8), which is the apple's position.

Now, checking if this path is collision-free:

After each move, the new head must not collide with any body part except possibly when eating the apple.

Let me simulate each step, considering how the body changes after each move.

Initial state:
Head: (4,7)
Body: [(3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]
Apple at (9,8)

Move 1: RIGHT
New head: (5,7)
Check collision: new_head is within bounds. Body parts after move:
- Insert old head (4,7) into body → [(4,7)] + [3,7; 3,6; ...] but wait, the body before was [B1=(3,7), B2=(3,6), B3=(3,5), B4=(3,4), T=(4,4)]. After moving right:

New head is (5,7). Body becomes [(4,7)] + [3,7; 3,6; 3,5; 3,4] and then remove tail. So new body is [(4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)].

So head is (5,7), body starts with (4,7). No collision because the head is (5,7) which isn't in the body except for when it's part of the new insertion. But the new_head is (5,7), and the inserted old head is (4,7), so no collision.

Move 2: RIGHT
New head: (6,7)
Body becomes [(5,7)] + [(4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5)]
And remove tail → new body is [(5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5)]

No collision.

Move 3: RIGHT
Head becomes (7,7)
Body: [(6,7)] + [5,7; 4,7; 3,7; 3,6]
Remove tail → [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6)]

No collision.

Move 4: RIGHT
Head becomes (8,7)
Body: [(7,7)] + [6,7; 5,7; 4,7; 3,7]
Remove tail → [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)]

No collision.

Move 5: RIGHT
Head becomes (9,7)
Body: [(8,7)] + [7,7; 6,7; 5,7; 4,7]
Remove tail → [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]

No collision.

Now, move 6: UP
Head becomes (9,8)
Check collision:
- new_head is within bounds.
- Check if it's in body parts. The current body after move 5 is [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]. So (9,8) is not part of the body.

But wait, when moving UP from (9,7), which direction is allowed? Current direction after move 5 was RIGHT. The next move can't be LEFT because that's the reverse direction. So allowed moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

So choosing UP is fine.

After moving UP:
- new_head = (9,8)
- Check if it's apple position → yes.
- So, since we ate the apple, body grows by 1 without removing tail.

Body becomes [(9,7)] + [8,7; 7,7; 6,7; 5,7] and keep the tail (4,7). Wait no: when eating apple, you insert old head and do not remove tail.

So after move 5:

Head is (9,7), body is [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)].

After moving UP to eat the apple:
- new_head = (9,8)
- insert old head (9,7) into body → [(9,7)] + [8,7; 7,7; 6,7; 5,7; 4,7]
- since we ate apple, do not remove tail. So the body becomes [(9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)].

So after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by one.

Now, check if there's enough space: since the apple is at (9,8), which is only 1 unit up from (9,7). No collision with body because none of the body parts are at y=8 yet.

Thus, this path seems safe.

Therefore, the sequence of moves would be RIGHT five times and then UP once.
</think>

The snake should move right continuously until it reaches column 9, then move up to eat the apple. This avoids collisions with its body and navigates directly to the target.

**Answer:**

The snake should make six moves: RIGHT (five times) followed by UP. So the answer is:

RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP

But since the question asks for the first move, which is the initial step after the current direction of RIGHT, and considering that moving directly towards the apple requires mostly RIGHT moves, the appropriate initial move is RIGHT.

However, to clarify the exact path, the sequence would be five rights and then one up. But as an initial single move response, it's:

\boxed{RIGHT}
