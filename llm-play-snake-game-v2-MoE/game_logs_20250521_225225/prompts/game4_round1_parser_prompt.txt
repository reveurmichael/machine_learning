You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this classic Snake game problem. The snake starts at (5,5) and needs to reach an apple at (5,6). Let me figure out the best path.

First, the snake can't reverse direction on its first move because that's against the rules. So if it's moving UP or DOWN initially, next time it can't go the opposite way. But in this case, since the head is already at (5,5), and the apple is directly to the right at (5,6), I think moving RIGHT would be the straightforward approach.

But wait, when the snake moves RIGHT once, its head will be at (6,5). The body segments behind will follow. Since it hasn't eaten anything yet, there's no growth in the body. So after each move, the snake just slides forward.

I should also make sure that moving RIGHT doesn't cause any collisions with itself or the walls. Looking at the coordinate system, x ranges from 0 to 9 and y does too. Moving right once will take it from (5,5) to (6,5). Since there's no body in between, this seems safe.

After each move, I'll check if any part of the snake hits itself or goes out of bounds. But since it's moving from the middle towards the right and not hugging the walls unnecessarily, collisions shouldn't be an issue here.

Also, after eating the apple, which is at (5,6), the snake should have enough moves left to avoid traps. So I need to ensure that there are still valid directions to move in case it gets stuck later on.

Putting this all together, moving RIGHT once seems like the safe and efficient path for the snake to reach the apple.

{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving right is the optimal path since it directly moves towards the apple at (5,6). The head can move from (5,5) to (6,5), then proceed upwards if necessary without reversing direction immediately."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (5, 6).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
