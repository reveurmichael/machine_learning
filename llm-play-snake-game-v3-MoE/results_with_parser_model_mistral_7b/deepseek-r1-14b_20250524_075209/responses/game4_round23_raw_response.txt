========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to move the snake from (7,7) to eat the apple at (9,9). The current direction is "UP", and the body segments are [(7,6), (7,5)]. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the initial setup. The head is at (7,7), which is near the top-right corner of the grid. The apple is right there at (9,9), but wait, no—the grid goes from 0 to 9 in both x and y, so (9,9) would actually be the very top-right corner, same as the example given.

Wait, no—the head is at (7,7), which is near the top-right, but not exactly at the corner. The apple is at (9,9), so that's two steps to the right and two steps up from the head.

But wait, in terms of movement, moving "RIGHT" increases x by 1, and "UP" increases y by 1. So from (7,7) to (9,9) requires moving +2 in x and +2 in y. That means I need a total of two "RIGHT" moves and two "UP" moves.

But the current direction is "UP". So, according to the movement rules, I can't immediately reverse direction. Since current direction is "UP", I cannot choose "DOWN" next. But I can choose any other direction except the opposite. Wait, actually, looking back at the rules: You cannot reverse. If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So from "UP", I can't go "DOWN".

So starting direction is "UP". So first move has to be either "LEFT", "RIGHT", or stay "UP".

But wait, the current direction is given as "UP". So when moving, after the first step, what happens? Let me think about the initial state.

The body is [(7,6), (7,5)], which means the tail is at (7,5). The head is at (7,7), then the next segment is (7,6) behind it. So the snake is currently moving upwards because the direction is "UP".

Wait no: If the direction is "UP", that would mean the head is moving up each step. But in the body list, [(7,6), (7,5)], so from (7,7) to (7,6)—that's down. Wait, maybe I got this wrong.

No, wait: The movement works such that when you move "UP", the new head is (x, y+1). So if the current direction is "UP", then the next position would be up. But in the body list, it shows where the previous parts are.

So the initial snake's head is at (7,7), and the body segments behind are [(7,6), (7,5)], which means that the snake is moving downwards because each segment after the head is lower by one in y-coordinate. Wait, no—that can't be right because if the direction was "DOWN", then each step would add a new head below.

But the initial body list is from behind the head to tail. So the head is at (7,7), and the next segment is (7,6)—so that's directly below it. Then (7,5) is below that. So this suggests that the snake is moving downward.

Wait, but the direction given is "UP". That seems conflicting because if you're moving up, your body segments would be above the head. But in this case, they are below. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, no—the current direction is the direction the head is moving. So if the current direction is "UP", then the next step will take the head to (7,8). The body list [(7,6), (7,5)] indicates that the previous steps were down, but the current movement is up.

Wait, no. Let me think again: Each time you move, the head moves in the chosen direction, and then the body follows by shifting forward. So if the current direction is "UP", the next move would take the head to (7,8). But the body segments behind are [(7,6), (7,5)], which suggests that previously, the snake was moving down.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The body list represents the previous positions after the head, so if the direction is "UP", the next move would be up, but the current body is below the head because it's been moving in a different direction before?

No, perhaps not. Let me clarify: The body list is ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So the first element after the head is (7,6), which is directly below (7,7). Then the next is (7,5), also directly below.

So this suggests that the snake was previously moving down because each step after the head is in a downward direction. But the current direction is "UP", meaning the last move was up. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait no—maybe the direction refers to the previous movement. Because when you change direction, the next move will be in the new direction, but the body follows accordingly.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to visualize it:

Head is at (7,7), body segments are [(7,6), (7,5)], and current direction is "UP". So that must mean that the snake was moving up before, but now it's about to move in a different direction.

Wait no—direction refers to the next movement. Because the problem says, the current direction is the one you're going to follow unless you change it.

So the initial state has head at (7,7), body behind as [(7,6), (7,5)], and direction is "UP". So if I don't change direction, the next move would be up. But from (7,7), moving up would take me to (7,8), which is within bounds.

But wait, when you're at (7,7) and move "UP", you go to (7,8). Then, the body segments follow: the head was at (7,7), so it becomes part of the body. The new body list would be [(7,7)] plus the previous ones, but then depending on whether we're growing or not.

Wait, no—the movement rules say that after moving, the old head is added to the front of the body list, and then if not eating an apple, the tail is removed.

So in this case, moving "UP" from (7,7) would take us to (7,8). Then, we check for collisions: new_head must not be any body segment except possibly the tail if it's about to move.

But currently, the body segments are [(7,6), (7,5)], so (7,8) is not among them. So no collision. Then, since the apple is at (9,9), which is not (7,8), we don't grow. So we add the old head (7,7) to the front of the body list, making it [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)], then remove the tail (7,5). So the new body list becomes [(7,7), (7,6)].

So after moving "UP", the snake's head is at (7,8), body at [(7,7), (7,6)], and direction remains "UP" until changed.

But wait, according to movement rules, you cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is "UP", next move can't be "DOWN". But in this case, the initial direction is "UP", so first move can be any except "DOWN".

Wait, no—the problem says: If current direction is "NONE" (which is only for the first move), you can choose any direction. Otherwise, if moving from a non-None direction, you cannot reverse.

So in our case, since the initial direction is "UP", the next move cannot be "DOWN". So possible moves are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or stay "UP".

But wait, no—the current direction is given as "UP", which means that the snake's last movement was "UP". So when planning the first move, we can't reverse it. Therefore, from "UP", we cannot choose "DOWN" next.

So for the first move, possible directions are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or continue with "UP".

But wait, according to the rules: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So in our case, we can't go "DOWN" as the first move.

So initial options are "UP", "LEFT", or "RIGHT".

But let's consider each option:

Option 1: Move "UP" again. Head goes to (7,8). Then check for collisions—new head is not in body segments. Then, since it's not eating apple, remove tail. So the body would be [(7,7), (7,6)] after moving.

But wait, from initial state, if we move "UP" again, the new_head is (7,8). The body before this move is [(7,6), (7,5)], so no collision except for possible tail. But in this case, since the new head is not the apple, and body segments are below, it's safe.

But then after moving "UP", the direction remains "UP" unless changed. So that could be a path towards the apple.

Option 2: Move "LEFT". From (7,7), moving left takes us to (6,7). Check for collision with body segments [(7,6), (7,5)]—no collision since (6,7) is not in there. Then add old head to front of body list, making it [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)], then remove tail (7,5). So new body is [(7,7), (7,6)]. The direction would now be "LEFT".

But this seems like a detour because we're moving away from the apple.

Option 3: Move "RIGHT". From (7,7) to (8,7). Then check for collision—(8,7) is not in body. Since it's not apple, remove tail. Now, head is at (8,7), body is [(7,7), (7,6)], direction is now "RIGHT".

This seems more promising because the apple is two steps to the right and up.

So perhaps moving "RIGHT" first would be better.

But let's think step by step. Our goal is to reach (9,9) from (7,7). So that requires moving right twice and up twice.

But the current direction is "UP", so if we choose to move "RIGHT" next, then in the next steps, we can continue moving "RIGHT" until aligned, then move up.

Alternatively, we could try to move "UP" first, but let's see what happens.

Wait, no—because from (7,7), moving "UP" would take us closer to y=9, which is good. But since the apple is at (9,9), which requires two rights and two ups.

But perhaps a better approach is to plan the minimal steps: right twice and up twice in any order, but making sure that each move doesn't cause collision with body segments except possibly the tail when moving towards it.

But considering that after each move, the old head becomes part of the body list, we have to ensure that new_head isn't colliding with any existing body except for the last segment if necessary.

Wait, no—actually, in movement rules: "You cannot reverse direction. If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'." So once we change direction, we can't go back immediately.

But perhaps it's better to just plan the moves:

From (7,7), current direction is "UP", body is [(7,6), (7,5)].

Possible first move: "UP" → (7,8). Then next steps can be right or up.

Alternatively, first move: "RIGHT" → (8,7). Then next moves can be right again or up.

Which path would allow us to reach the apple without collision?

Let me try moving "RIGHT" first:

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,7), body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)], direction is now "RIGHT".

Move 2: RIGHT → (9,7). Check for collisions: body is [(8,7), (7,6)]. So new_head (9,7) not in there. Apple is at (9,9), so no growth. Remove tail (7,6). Body becomes [(8,7)].

Now, direction is "RIGHT".

Move 3: UP → can't reverse from "RIGHT" to "LEFT", but we can change to any other direction except the opposite. Wait, current direction after move 2 is "RIGHT". So next move can't be "LEFT".

But in this case, moving "UP" is allowed because it's not the opposite of "RIGHT". The opposite would be "LEFT". So yes, from "RIGHT", we can choose any direction except "LEFT".

So Move 3: UP → (9,8). Check collision: body is [(9,7), (8,7)]. New head is at (9,8), which is not in the body. Apple is still there, so no growth. Remove tail (8,7). Body becomes [(9,7)].

Now, direction is "UP".

Move 4: UP → (9,9) which is the apple! So we've reached it in four moves: right, right, up, up.

Wait, but let me recount:

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,7), body [(7,7), (7,6)] becomes after adding head and removing tail: [(8,7), (7,6)]?

Wait no—let's correct this step by step.

Starting position:

Head: (7,7)

Body: [(7,6), (7,5)]

Direction: UP

Move 1: RIGHT

New head: (8,7)

Check collision: new_head (8,7) not in body. So safe.

Add old head (7,7) to front of body list: [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]

Since not growing, remove tail (7,5). So new body is [(7,7), (7,6)].

Direction changes to "RIGHT".

Now, Move 2: RIGHT again.

New head: (9,7)

Check collision: body is [(8,7), (7,6)]. No collision. Safe.

Add old head (8,7) to front: [(8,7), (7,7), (7,6)]

Remove tail (7,6). New body: [(8,7), (7,7)].

Direction remains "RIGHT" unless changed.

Move 3: UP

New head: (9,8)

Check collision: body is [(9,7), (8,7)]. No collision. Safe.

Add old head (9,7) to front: [(9,7), (9,8), ... wait no—old head is the previous position before this move, which was (9,7). Wait, movement steps:

After Move 2, head is at (9,7). Body is [(8,7), (7,7)]. Direction is "RIGHT".

Move 3: UP.

So new head is (9,8).

Now, check if (9,8) collides with any body segments except possibly the tail. The body after Move 2 was [(8,7), (7,7)] and then after adding old head (9,7). Wait no—let's clarify:

Wait, after each move, you add the old head to the front of the body list, then remove the tail if not growing.

So in Move 1: After moving RIGHT from (7,7) to (8,7), we add (7,7) to front → [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)], then remove (7,5). So body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)].

Move 2: Move RIGHT again from (8,7) to (9,7). Add old head (8,7) to front → [(8,7), (7,7), (7,6)]. Then remove tail (7,6). So body is now [(8,7), (7,7)].

Move 3: Move UP from (9,7) to (9,8). Add old head (9,7) to front → [(9,7), (8,7), (7,7)]. Then remove tail (7,7). So body becomes [(9,7), (8,7)].

Now, check collision: new_head is (9,8). Body is [(9,7), (8,7)], which doesn't include (9,8). So safe.

Then, since not at apple, proceed. Direction changes to "UP".

Move 4: Move UP again from (9,8) to (9,9)—apple! Success.

So yes, moving RIGHT twice and then UP twice would work.

But let's make sure that each move is allowed in terms of direction changes.

From initial state:

Direction: UP

First move: RIGHT (allowed, not reverse)

Second move: RIGHT again (allowed, same direction)

Third move: UP (allowed, since current direction after second move was RIGHT; moving UP is not a reverse of RIGHT's opposite, which is LEFT. So yes.)

Fourth move: UP (current direction is now UP, allowed).

So all moves are valid in terms of direction changes.

Alternatively, what if we first moved UP twice to get closer vertically?

Move 1: UP → (7,8). Check collision: body [(7,6), (7,5)] doesn't include (7,8). Safe. Add old head (7,7) → body becomes [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)], remove tail (7,5) → [(7,7), (7,6)]. Direction now UP.

Move 2: UP again → (7,9). Check collision: body is [(7,8), (7,7)]? Wait no—let's correct:

Wait after first move to (7,8):

Body becomes old head added to front and tail removed.

So initial body after Move 1: add (7,7) to front → [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)], then remove (7,5). So body is [(7,7), (7,6)].

Wait no—wait, when you move UP from (7,7), the new head is (7,8). Then, the old head (7,7) is added to front of body list. The previous body was [(7,6), (7,5)], so adding (7,7) in front makes it [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]. Since not growing (apple not at (7,8)), remove tail (7,5). So new body is [(7,7), (7,6)].

So after Move 1: head at (7,8), body [(7,7), (7,6)], direction UP.

Move 2: UP again → (7,9). Check collision: body is [(7,8), (7,7)]. New head (7,9) not in there. Add old head (7,8) to front → [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6)], remove tail (7,6). Body becomes [(7,8), (7,7)].

Move 3: RIGHT → (8,9). Check collision: body is [(8,9)? Wait no—body after Move 2 was [(7,8), (7,7)]. Moving right from (7,9) to (8,9).

So new head (8,9). Body before adding is [(7,8), (7,7)].

Add old head (7,9) → but wait, no: when moving RIGHT from (7,9) to (8,9), the old head was (7,9), which is added to front. So body becomes [(7,9), (7,8), (7,7)], then remove tail (7,7). So new body is [(7,9), (7,8)].

Check collision: new_head (8,9) not in body.

Then, since apple is at (9,9), move RIGHT again.

Move 4: RIGHT → (9,9). Success.

So in this path:

Moves:

UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT

But wait, direction after first two moves would be UP. Then moving right twice.

Is that allowed?

Yes, because after moving UP twice, the direction is still UP, and then changing to RIGHT is allowed since it's not a reverse of anything—RIGHT's opposite is LEFT, which we're not choosing.

So both paths work.

But in terms of steps, either way requires four moves.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to do it in fewer steps, but given that the distance is two right and two up, it's at least four moves.

Wait, no—because each move can only change direction if not reversing. But since we have to make two rights and two ups, regardless of order, it's four moves.

So both approaches are valid.

But the initial question was just to reach the apple, so any path is fine as long as it doesn't cause collision except possibly with the tail when moving towards it.

In our first approach:

RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP

In the second approach:

UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT

Both work.

Alternatively, perhaps a different order like RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, UP could also work, but we have to ensure that after each move, direction changes are allowed.

Let me try:

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,7), body [(7,7), (7,6)], direction RIGHT

Move 2: UP → (8,8). Check collision: body is [(8,7), (7,7)]. New head (8,8) not in there. Add old head (8,7) to front → [(8,7), (7,7), (7,6)], remove tail (7,6). Body becomes [(8,7), (7,7)].

Move 3: RIGHT → (9,8). Check collision: body is [(9,8)? Wait no—body after Move 2 was [(8,7), (7,7)]. Moving from (8,8) to (9,8):

Add old head (8,8) to front of body → [(8,8), (8,7), (7,7)], remove tail (7,7). So body becomes [(8,8), (8,7)].

Check collision: new_head (9,8) not in body.

Move 4: UP → (9,9). Success.

So this path is RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, UP. Four moves again.

But wait, after Move 2, direction was UP, so from UP to RIGHT—allowed? Yes, because UP's opposite is DOWN, which isn't being moved to. So allowed.

Yes, all directions except for the exact reverse are allowed.

So multiple paths work.

The main point is that as long as we make two rights and two ups in any order that doesn't require reversing direction (which would be moving LEFT from RIGHT or RIGHT from LEFT, etc.), it's possible.

But wait—could there be a scenario where a collision happens? For example, if after some moves, the new head position is already in the body except for the tail when approaching it?

In our earlier examples, we didn't have that issue because we moved away and then towards. Let me check another possibility.

Suppose we tried to move UP first, then RIGHT, but maybe end up colliding with the body.

Let's see:

Move 1: UP → (7,8). Body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)], direction UP

Move 2: RIGHT → (8,8). Check collision: body is [(7,8), (7,7)]. New head (8,8) not in there. Safe.

Add old head (8,8)? Wait no—let me correct:

After Move 1: head at (7,8), body is [(7,7), (7,6)]

Move 2: RIGHT from (7,8) to (8,8). Check collision: body is [(7,7), (7,6)]. So safe.

Add old head (7,8) to front → [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6)], then remove tail (7,6). Body becomes [(7,8), (7,7)].

Direction changes to RIGHT.

Move 3: UP → (8,9). Check collision: body is [(8,8), (7,8)]. New head (8,9) not in there. Safe.

Add old head (8,8) to front → [(8,8), (8,9), ... wait no—wait:

After Move 2: head at (8,8). Body after adding old head is [(7,8), (7,7)], then removing tail (7,6). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify step by step:

Starting from initial state.

Move 1: UP to (7,8)

Body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)] after adding old head and removing tail.

Move 2: RIGHT to (8,8)

Add old head (7,8) to front → body is now [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6)], then remove tail (7,6). So new body is [(7,8), (7,7)].

Now, direction is RIGHT.

Move 3: UP from (8,8) to (8,9)

Add old head (8,8) to front → body becomes [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7)], then remove tail (7,7). So new body is [(8,8), (7,8)].

Check collision: new_head (8,9) not in body. Safe.

Move 4: RIGHT again to (9,9). Success.

So this path also works and doesn't cause collisions.

But what if we tried a different order, like UP, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT?

Wait, but that's similar to the earlier paths.

The key is to make sure that when changing direction, you're not moving in the exact reverse direction of your previous move.

As long as that's avoided, any other direction change is allowed.

So yes, multiple valid paths exist.

Therefore, the answer should be a sequence of moves that result in reaching (9,9) without reversing directions. The minimal steps are four, and one possible path is RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP.
</think>

To reach the apple located at position (9, 9) from the initial position (7, 7), follow these steps:

1. **Move Right** to (8, 7).
2. **Move Right** again to (9, 7).
3. **Move Up** to (9, 8).
4. **Move Up** once more to (9, 9).

Each move changes direction only when necessary and avoids reversing directions, ensuring a collision-free path.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** You're at (7, 7) with the body segments [(7, 6), (7, 5)] behind you.
2. **First Move - Right:** Navigate from (7, 7) to (8, 7). The body updates to include your previous position, now [(8, 7), (7, 7)], and removes the tail segment (7, 5).
3. **Second Move - Right:** Continue to (9, 7). The body becomes [(9, 7), (8, 7)] after updating.
4. **Third Move - Up:** Shift upwards to (9, 8). The body updates to [(9, 8), (9, 7)].
5. **Fourth Move - Up:** Finally, move up to (9, 9) where the apple is located.

This sequence successfully navigates you to the target without causing any collisions with your own body segments.
