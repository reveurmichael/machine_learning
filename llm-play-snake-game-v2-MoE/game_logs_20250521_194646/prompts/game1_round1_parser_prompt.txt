Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake get to the apple at (4,0) without dying. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the current state is that the snake's head is at (5,5), and the direction is NONE. That means any move is allowed on the first step because there's no previous direction to worry about. The body cells are empty, so the snake isn't very long right now—just the head. The apple is at (4,0), which is below and a bit to the left of the head.

I need to plan a path that moves the snake from (5,5) to (4,0). Let's look at the coordinates. From (5,5) to (4,0), the x-coordinate needs to decrease by 1 (since 5-4=1), so I'll need more LEFT moves than RIGHT. The y-coordinate needs to decrease by 5 (from 5 to 0), which means more DOWN moves than UP.

The movement rules say that the snake can't reverse direction. Since the current direction is NONE, the first move can be any valid direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But I need to choose a path that gets to the apple safely without hitting walls or its own body.

Looking at the target position (4,0), which is on the bottom row of the grid. So, perhaps moving down as much as possible makes sense? Let me visualize this.

Starting at (5,5). If I move DOWN first, that would take me to (5,4). Then another DOWN to (5,3), and so on until I reach y=0. But wait, from (5,5) moving DOWN each time would get me to (5,0), but the apple is at (4,0). So after getting to (5,0), I need to move LEFT once to get to (4,0). That seems straightforward.

Wait, but let's check the constraints. After eating the apple, there should be at least one legal move afterward. Since the snake would have grown by one segment when it eats the apple, but if after that, moving in any direction doesn't cause a collision, we're good.

So the path could be:

1. Move DOWN five times from (5,5) to (5,0).
2. Then MOVE LEFT once to reach (4,0).

But wait, each move changes the head and the body. Let's simulate this step by step.

Initial position: Head at (5,5), body is empty.

Move 1: DOWN → new head at (5,4). Body becomes [(5,5)].
Move 2: DOWN → head (5,3). Body becomes [(5,4), (5,5)].
Move 3: DOWN → head (5,2). Body now has three cells.
Move 4: DOWN → (5,1).
Move 5: DOWN → (5,0).

Now, after five DOWN moves, the head is at (5,0). The body is [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ].

Now, to move LEFT from (5,0) would take the head to (4,0). But wait, after moving LEFT, the new head is at (4,0). The body becomes [ (5,0), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ]? Wait, no. Because each move adds a new segment at the head and removes one from the tail unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, no: when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail. So in this case, after moving DOWN five times to reach (5,0), the snake's body would have grown by four segments because each move adds a new head but doesn't remove the tail until it steps on the apple.

Wait, let me clarify:

- Initial state: head at (5,5), body is empty. So length 1.
- After first move DOWN: head is (5,4), body is [(5,5)]. Length 2.
- Second move DOWN: head (5,3), body [(5,4), (5,5)]. Length 3.
- Third move DOWN: head (5,2), body [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ].
- Fourth move DOWN: (5,1). Body has four cells.
- Fifth move DOWN: (5,0). Now the snake is five segments long.

At this point, when moving to (5,0), which is where the apple is. So in the sixth move, we eat the apple. When the head is at (5,0), and that's where the apple is, so after moving there, the apple is eaten. Thus, the snake grows by one segment. So now, the body would be [ (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0) ], and the head moves to (4,0). Wait no—after moving to (5,0), which is where the apple is, then when you eat it, the tail doesn't shrink. So after eating, the body becomes [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0) ].

Then, to move LEFT from (5,0) to (4,0). Let's check if that's safe. After moving to (4,0), the new head is there, and the body segments would be [ (5,0), (5,5), ... but wait, no—the body follows each step. So after each move, the previous positions become part of the body except for the tail unless you eat an apple.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think about how the snake's body updates with each move:

- Each move: new head is added at the front; if not eating apple, the tail is removed. If eating apple, the tail remains.

So in this case, after five DOWN moves to (5,0), which is where the apple is, that sixth move would be the one where we eat it. So when you move from (5,1) to (5,0), you're moving into the apple's position, so you eat it, and your body grows by not removing the tail.

So after eating, the body becomes:

Head: (5,0)

Body segments: [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Because each previous move added a segment at the head and the tail was removed unless an apple was eaten. Wait, no—each time you make a move that doesn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. But when you do eat the apple, the tail stays.

So moving from (5,1) to (5,0):

- The new head is at (5,0).

- Since we ate the apple, the body segments don't get pruned; so all previous positions become part of the body: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ] plus the new head (5,0). So now the snake is six segments long.

Then, to move LEFT from (5,0) to (4,0):

- New head: (4,0)

- The body becomes [ (5,0), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ]?

Wait, no. Because after moving to (5,0), the snake's body is:

After eating apple at (5,0):

- The head is at (5,0)

- Body segments: [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Because each move from (5,5) down to (5,0) added a segment, and since the last move ate an apple, we didn't remove any.

So when moving LEFT from (5,0):

- New head is at (4,0).

- The previous body segments are [ (5,1), (5,2), ..., (5,5) ]

But wait, no. Each time you make a move, the current head becomes part of the body, except for the last segment if it's not an apple. So perhaps I need to model this more accurately.

Let me try again:

Start: Head at (5,5), body empty.

Move 1: DOWN → head (5,4). Body is [ (5,5) ]

Move 2: DOWN → head (5,3). Body becomes [ (5,4), (5,5) ]

Move 3: DOWN → (5,2). Body: [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Move 4: DOWN → (5,1). Body: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Move 5: DOWN → (5,0). Now, check if (5,0) is apple. Yes.

So after this move, since we ate the apple, the body doesn't lose its tail. So the body becomes [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ] and the head is at (5,0). The snake's length increases by one.

Now, next move: LEFT from (5,0) → (4,0).

After moving:

- New head is (4,0)

- Body becomes [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Wait, no. Because when you move LEFT from (5,0):

The previous body segments were [ (5,1), (5,2), ..., (5,5) ] and the head was at (5,0).

After moving to (4,0):

- The new head is (4,0)

- The old head (5,0) becomes part of the body.

But since we just ate an apple, does that mean the tail doesn't get removed? Wait, no—the eating happens when you step on the apple. So after moving into (5,0), which was the apple's position, the snake grows by not removing the tail. Then, in the next move, when you move LEFT, you don't eat an apple, so the tail is (5,5) and it would be removed.

Wait, no—after eating the apple at (5,0), the body becomes:

Body: [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Head: (5,0)

So when you move LEFT to (4,0):

- The new head is (4,0)

- The old head (5,0) becomes part of the body.

- Since we are not eating an apple here, the tail (which is (5,5)) gets removed. So the body becomes [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]

So after this move, the snake's head is at (4,0), and the body is from (4,0) to (5,4). The tail was at (5,5), but that's removed because we didn't eat an apple on this move.

Wait, no—each time you make a move, if it's not an apple, the tail is removed. So after eating the apple at (5,0), when you move LEFT to (4,0), since there's no apple there, the tail (which was at (5,5)) would be removed.

Wait, but after moving into (5,0) and eating the apple, the body segments are [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ] plus the head at (5,0). So total length is 6. Then when you move LEFT to (4,0):

- The new head is (4,0)

- The old head (5,0) becomes part of the body.

- Since no apple is eaten here, the tail is removed. So the tail was at (5,5), so it's cut off.

So the body after moving LEFT would be [ (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]

Wait, that doesn't make sense because each move adds a new head and removes a tail unless you ate an apple. So perhaps the body after eating is:

After moving to (5,0):

- Head: (5,0)

- Body: [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Because each move added a segment when you moved DOWN, and since the last move was eating an apple, you didn't remove any.

Then, moving LEFT:

- New head: (4,0)

- Body becomes [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]

Because we add (5,0) to the body and remove the tail at (5,5).

Now, after this move, is the new head safe? Let's check if (4,0) collides with any part of the body. The body segments are [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]. So no collision at (4,0). Also, it's within grid bounds.

But wait, what about after this move? We need to ensure that the snake can make at least one more move. Since we've eaten the apple, the next move could be any direction except for reversing. The current direction is NONE because each move changes the direction.

Wait, no—the initial direction was NONE, but after moving DOWN five times, the last move's direction was DOWN. So when moving LEFT from (5,0), the direction is now LEFT. Then, after that, if we had to make another move, we couldn't go RIGHT because it would reverse the direction.

But in this case, once we reach (4,0) and eat the apple, do we need to make more moves? No, because the apple is eaten; we just needed to get there. So the sequence is:

1. DOWN from (5,5) → (5,4)

2. DOWN → (5,3)

3. DOWN → (5,2)

4. DOWN → (5,1)

5. DOWN → (5,0) (eats apple)

6. LEFT → (4,0) (doesn't eat apple)

But wait, no—step 5 is the move that eats the apple, so step 6 is a new move where we're not eating an apple.

So in total, to get from (5,5) to (4,0), it's six moves: five DOWNs and one LEFT. But each move changes direction except for consecutive same directions.

Wait no—when you make multiple DOWN moves in a row, the direction remains DOWN until you change it.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that moving from (5,0) to (4,0) doesn't cause any collision because (4,0) isn't part of the body except for the new head.

Wait, but in this case, when you move LEFT from (5,0), the body becomes [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ] and the new head is at (4,0). So (4,0) isn't part of any previous segments except as the new head. Therefore, it's safe.

So this sequence seems to work:

Move DOWN five times to get to (5,0), then move LEFT once to (4,0).

But wait, let me visualize this step by step.

Start at (5,5). No body.

1. Move DOWN: head is (5,4). Body is [ (5,5) ]

2. Move DOWN: head (5,3). Body [ (5,4), (5,5) ]

3. Move DOWN: head (5,2). Body [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

4. Move DOWN: head (5,1). Body [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

5. Move DOWN: head (5,0). Since this is the apple's position, we eat it. Body becomes [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ] because we added (5,0) as the new head and didn't remove any tail.

6. Move LEFT: head (4,0). Since not eating apple, remove the tail (which was at (5,5)), so body becomes [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]

So after this move, the snake's head is at (4,0) and body segments are from (5,4) down to (5,0). No collisions.

But wait, after moving LEFT, the new head is at (4,0), and the body includes (5,0), which was just added. So (5,0) is part of the body, but (4,0) is only the head, so no collision.

Yes, that seems safe.

Alternatively, perhaps a shorter path exists. Let's see:

From (5,5) to (4,0):

Another way could be to move LEFT four times and DOWN once, but that might involve more steps or potential collisions.

But let's analyze both approaches.

First approach: five DOWNs then one LEFT → six moves.

Second approach: perhaps moving LEFT first, but that would require crossing through the grid which may not be optimal.

Alternatively, could we move in a different direction to reach (4,0) faster?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The initial idea is to go straight down five times and then left once.

But let me check if this sequence works without any collisions:

Each time you make a DOWN move, the previous position becomes part of the body, but since you're moving directly downward, none of those intermediate positions will be revisited except as part of the body. So no collision occurs in the first five moves.

Then, after being at (5,0), moving LEFT to (4,0) is safe because that position isn't part of the body yet—it's only the head.

So yes, this path works.

Another point: when you eat the apple at (5,0), your next move can be in any direction except for reversing. But since you were moving DOWN before and now you're moving LEFT, which is allowed because it's a change of direction.

Thus, the sequence of moves is:

DOWN ×5 → LEFT

Total of six moves.

Wait, but each move is one step? Or do I need to represent them as individual steps?

In terms of code or output, perhaps I should list each movement separately. But since the problem is about finding a path, not necessarily the shortest, this approach seems valid.

Alternatively, let's see if there's a shorter path with fewer moves.

From (5,5) to (4,0):

The minimal number of steps would be moving down 5 times and left once: total six moves. So that's probably the shortest path.

Another thing to consider: are there any obstacles or other constraints? From the problem description, it seems like we're just navigating an empty grid, so no obstacles.

Therefore, the path is:

1. DOWN
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. LEFT

Each move changes the direction except for consecutive same directions, but in this case, after five DOWNs and then a LEFT, it's fine because each move can change direction.

So the final answer would be to list these moves: five times 'DOWN' followed by one 'LEFT'.

But let me confirm:

Start at (5,5). No body. Move 1: DOWN → (5,4). Body [ (5,5) ]

Move 2: DOWN → (5,3). Body [ (5,4), (5,5) ]

Move 3: DOWN → (5,2). Body [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Move 4: DOWN → (5,1). Body [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Move 5: DOWN → (5,0). Eat apple. Body becomes [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]

Move 6: LEFT → (4,0). Not eating apple. Tail at (5,5) is removed. Body now [ (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]

Thus, the snake successfully reaches (4,0) without any collisions.

So the answer would be six moves: five 'DOWN's and one 'LEFT'.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at (5,5) on a grid to reach the target position at (4,0). The snake can move in four directions—up, down, left, or right—and each movement changes its direction. The goal is to determine the sequence of moves that allows the snake to safely reach the target without colliding with any part of its body.

### Approach
1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at position (5,5) on the grid.
2. **Direction Changes**: Each move changes the snake's direction unless it continues in the same direction consecutively.
3. **Avoiding Collisions**: Ensure that each new head position does not overlap with any part of the body segments.
4. **Eating Apple**: When the snake reaches (5,0), it eats an apple, which means its tail is not removed, thus increasing its length.

The optimal path involves moving the snake downward five times to reach (5,0) and then moving left once to reach the target position (4,0). This approach ensures that the snake does not collide with itself and efficiently navigates to the target in six moves.

### Solution Code
```python
# The sequence of moves is as follows:
moves = ['DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'LEFT']
```

### Explanation
1. **Move 1**: DOWN from (5,5) to (5,4)
2. **Move 2**: DOWN from (5,4) to (5,3)
3. **Move 3**: DOWN from (5,3) to (5,2)
4. **Move 4**: DOWN from (5,2) to (5,1)
5. **Move 5**: DOWN from (5,1) to (5,0), where the snake eats an apple.
6. **Move 6**: LEFT from (5,0) to (4,0)

This sequence ensures that the snake safely navigates to the target position without any collisions and successfully eats the apple at (5,0).
