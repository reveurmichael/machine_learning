You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (5,6), and the apple is at (5,7). The current direction is UP. The body is [(5,5), (5,4)]. So the snake is currently moving upwards, and the body is two segments behind the head.

First, I need to figure out the best way to get the head to the apple. The apple is directly above the head, one step up. Since the current direction is UP, moving UP again would take the head to (5,7), which is the apple's position. Let me check if that's possible.

If the snake moves UP, the new head would be (5,7). Now, check for collisions. The body segments are (5,5) and (5,4). The new head is at (5,7), which is not overlapping with any body segments. The tail is at (5,4), and when moving, the body shifts. Since the apple is eaten, the body would grow. Let me go through the movement steps.

Original body is [(5,5), (5,4)]. When moving UP, the new head is (5,7). Since the apple is there, the snake eats it. The body is updated by inserting the old head (5,6) at the front. So the body becomes [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]. Since the apple is eaten, the tail doesn't move. So the body is now three segments long. The new head is (5,7). The full snake is [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]. 

Now, after eating the apple, the snake's next move needs to have at least one legal move. Let's check. The next move can't be DOWN because the direction was UP, and reversing is not allowed. But the snake can move UP again, or LEFT/RIGHT. However, the body is now longer, so we need to ensure that the next move doesn't hit the body. Let's see: after moving UP once, the head is at (5,7), and the body is (5,6), (5,5), (5,4). If the next move is UP again, the new head would be (5,8). The body segments are (5,6), (5,5), (5,4). No collision. So that's okay. So the path is possible.

Wait, but the initial move is to go UP once. That would take the head directly to the apple. Let me check the collision rules again. The movement step 2 says that if the new head is outside the grid, or if it coincides with any body cell except the tail's current cell when that tail moves. In this case, the new head is (5,7), which is not in the body's current positions. The body segments are (5,5) and (5,4), so no collision. So moving UP once is safe.

So the moves would be just ["UP"], right? Let me check the movement example. For example, if the head is at (5,6) and direction is UP, moving UP again would take it to (5,7). The body is [(5,5), (5,4)]. After inserting the old head (5,6) into the body list, the body becomes [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4)], and since the apple is eaten, the tail isn't removed. So the body is now three segments. The head is at (5,7), and the body is [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]. 

Yes, that seems safe. The only possible problem is if the next move would be invalid, but since the problem only requires reaching the apple, and the first move is sufficient. The apple is eaten in the first move. So the moves list should be ["UP"], and the reasoning is that moving directly up reaches the apple without collision.

But wait, let me check the current direction. The current direction is UP, so moving UP again is allowed. Because reversing is only when you go opposite direction. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN, but UP is allowed. So that's okay.

Yes, this seems correct. The answer is just moving UP once.

{
"moves": ["UP"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly above the head at (5,7). Moving UP immediately reaches the apple without collision, as the new head position does not overlap with any body segments. The body grows after eating the apple, leaving a valid path for subsequent moves."
}

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 4), (5, 5)], to eat the apple at (5, 7).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
