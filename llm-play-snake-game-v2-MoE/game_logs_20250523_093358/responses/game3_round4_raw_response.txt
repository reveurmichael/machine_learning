========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

To solve this problem, we need to plan a path for the snake from its current head position (4,7) to the apple's position (3,6). Let's analyze the current state and determine the safest moves:

1. The snake is currently moving UP.
2. There are no body segments blocking our potential paths, so we need only worry about walls.

The target apple at (3,6) is:
- 1 unit to the left of the head at (4,7)
- 1 unit down from the head

Since the snake can't reverse direction on the first move and it's currently moving UP, our initial possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT. However, since we need to go left eventually, let's start by going LEFT.

We'll then follow with DOWN moves until we reach the apple at (3,6).

Let's plan this out:

1. Move LEFT from (4,7) → (3,7)
2. Move DOWN from (3,7) → (3,6)

This path is simple and safe since there are no body segments or wall collisions along the way.

Here's the JSON output with our planned moves and reasoning:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The apple at (3,6) is 1 unit left and 1 unit down from the head at (4,7). Moving LEFT first then DOWN reaches the target safely."
}
```

This plan satisfies all constraints: it doesn't reverse direction immediately, avoids collisions with walls or non-existent body segments, and ensures we reach the apple in a minimal number of moves.
