<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The snake is at (5,5), and the apple is at (8,0). The grid is 10x10, with (0,0) as the bottom-left and (9,9) top-right. The snake's body is currently empty, which means it's just the head. So the snake is length 1 right now.

First, I need to figure out a path from (5,5) to (8,0) without colliding with itself. Since the body is empty, the immediate danger is moving into walls or into positions that would cause the body to block future moves, especially after eating the apple.

The apple is at (8,0). The head needs to reach there. Let's think about the movement. The head is at (5,5), which is in the middle of the grid. The apple is at (8,0), which is towards the bottom-right corner. So the snake needs to move right three times (from x=5 to x=8) and down five times (from y=5 to y=0). But since the snake's body is empty, the main issue is making sure that after eating the apple, the snake doesn't get trapped.

But since the body is empty, the initial moves can be straightforward. However, the problem is that when the snake eats the apple, the body will grow. So after reaching the apple, the snake's body will be longer, and we need to make sure there's a way to move after that.

Let me plan the path step by step. Starting at (5,5). The apple is at (8,0). Let's think of moving right first to get closer to the x-coordinate of the apple. Then move down. But moving directly might cause the snake to hit walls or itself when the body grows.

Wait, but the initial body is empty. So the snake can move freely until it eats the apple. Let's think about the movement steps. Let's try to move right three times, then down five times. But let's check if that's possible.

First, move right to (6,5), then (7,5), then (8,5). From there, move down to (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0). That would take 3 right moves and 5 down moves. But when the snake reaches (8,5), the next steps would be moving down. But when the snake is at (8,5), the body is still empty. Wait, but when the snake moves, the body is updated. Let me think about the movement steps.

Wait, the snake starts with the head at (5,5) and body empty. So each move, the head moves, and since the body is empty, after moving, the body is updated. For example, first move right to (6,5). The body becomes [(5,5)] (since after moving, the old head is added to the body, but since the snake was length 1, the body is now length 1. Then, when moving again, the next move would be to (7,5), and the body becomes [(6,5)], and so on. So when the snake reaches (8,5), the body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no. Wait, the body list is from the segment immediately behind the head. Let me recheck the movement rules.

The body list is the segments behind the head. When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. So for the first move, the head is at (5,5), body is empty. Suppose the snake moves right to (6,5). Then the new head is (6,5). The body list is updated by inserting the old head (5,5) at the front. Since the body was empty, inserting (5,5) becomes the body. Then, since the snake didn't eat the apple (the apple is at (8,0)), the tail is removed. But since the body was only one element (after inserting), removing the tail would make the body empty again. Wait, that can't be right. Let me look back at the movement update rules.

Rule 3c says: if not eating apple, remove the last element of BODY. So when the snake moves, the body is updated as follows: insert the old head at the front, then remove the last element (the tail). So for the initial case, when the body is empty, inserting the old head (5,5) would make the body list [ (5,5) ] (since it's the first element). Then, since the snake didn't eat the apple, we remove the last element, which is (5,5), so the body is empty again. Wait, that seems like the body is always empty. But that can't be correct. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the movement rules.

Wait, the body list is the segments behind the head. So the full snake is [head] + body. When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the body is updated. Let me recheck the example given.

In the first example, the snake is [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)], and moving left to (3,4). The new head is (3,4). Then, the body is updated by inserting the old head (4,4) at the front of the body, making the body [ (4,4), (4,3) ]. Then, since the snake didn't eat the apple, the tail (the last element of the body) is removed. So the body becomes [ (4,4) ], and the new snake is [ (3,4), (4,4) ].

So for the initial case where the body is empty, when moving, the body list is updated by inserting the old head (5,5) at the front, making the body [ (5,5) ] (since the body was empty). Then, since the apple is not eaten, the tail is removed (the last element of the body, which is (5,5)), so the body becomes empty again. So the body is always empty after each move unless the apple is eaten. That would mean that the snake's body is only non-empty when it has eaten the apple. Wait, that seems odd. But according to the movement rules, the body list is the segments behind the head. So if the snake is moving normally, the body is always empty. But that can't be right. Maybe the initial body is empty, but after moving, the body has one segment (the previous head), but then it's removed again. That would make the body empty again. So the snake is only length 1. That must be the case here. Because the initial body is empty, and each movement adds the old head to the body, then removes the tail. So the body remains empty unless the apple is eaten. So the snake is length 1, moving with no body segments. That's possible. So the snake can move freely until it eats the apple. Once it eats the apple, the body will grow, and the movement will have to account for that.

So the initial movement is straightforward. The snake can move directly towards the apple. But the apple is at (8,0), which is three steps right and five steps down. However, the snake must avoid moving into itself when the body is growing. Wait, but the initial body is empty. So when the snake moves, the body is empty. So during movement, the snake's head can move directly towards the apple. But after eating the apple, the body will have a segment, so the next move must be careful.

So the plan is to move right three times, then down five times. Let's check for possible collisions. Since the body is empty, moving right three times to (8,5) and then down to (8,0) should be safe. But when the snake reaches (8,0), which is the apple's position, the body will grow. Let's think about the steps.

Let's outline the moves:

1. Right → (6,5)
2. Right → (7,5)
3. Right → (8,5)
4. Down → (8,4)
5. Down → (8,3)
6. Down → (8,2)
7. Down → (8,1)
8. Down → (8,0)

At step 8, the head is at (8,0), which is the apple's position. So the snake eats the apple. Now, the body will grow. So after eating, the body becomes [ (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) ] (assuming the steps taken). Wait, let's think about the body after each move.

Let me track the body after each move.

Initial state: head (5,5), body empty.

Move 1: Right → new head (6,5). Insert old head (5,5) at front of body. Body is [ (5,5) ]. Since no apple eaten, remove the tail (last element of body). Body becomes empty again. So now, the snake is [head (6,5), body empty].

Move 2: Right → new head (7,5). Insert old head (6,5) into body. Body becomes [ (6,5) ]. Remove tail → empty. Snake is [ (7,5), empty ].

Move 3: Right → new head (8,5). Insert (7,5) into body. Body [ (7,5) ]. Remove tail → empty. Snake is [ (8,5), empty ].

Move 4: Down → new head (8,4). Insert (8,5) into body. Body [ (8,5) ]. Remove tail → empty. Snake is [ (8,4), empty ].

Move 5: Down → (8,3). Insert (8,4) into body. Body [ (8,4) ]. Remove → empty.

Move 6: Down → (8,2). Insert (8,3) into body. Body [ (8,3) ]. Remove → empty.

Move 7: Down → (8,1). Insert (8,2) into body. Body [ (8,2) ]. Remove → empty.

Move 8: Down → (8,0). Insert (8,1) into body. Body [ (8,1) ]. Since the head is at (8,0), which is the apple's position, the snake eats the apple. So the body is updated by inserting the old head (8,1) into the body. Then, since the apple was eaten, the tail is not removed. So the body becomes [ (8,1) ] (from the previous step) + (8,1) inserted? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves to (8,0) and eats the apple, the body is updated by inserting the old head (which was at (8,1)) into the body. The previous body after move 7 was [ (8,2) ]? Wait, no. Let me retrace the body after each move.

Wait, after each move, the body is updated as follows:

After move 1 (right to (6,5)):

- Insert old head (5,5) into body → body [ (5,5) ].

- Since apple not eaten, remove tail (5,5) → body empty.

After move 2 (right to (7,5)):

- Insert old head (6,5) into body → [ (6,5) ].

- Remove tail → empty.

Similarly, after move 3 (right to (8,5)):

- Insert (7,5) into body → [ (7,5) ].

- Remove → empty.

So after move 3, the body is empty again.

Move 4 (down to (8,4)):

- Insert (8,5) into body → [ (8,5) ].

- Remove → empty.

So after move 4, body is empty.

Move 5 (down to (8,3)):

- Insert (8,4) into body → [ (8,4) ].

- Remove → empty.

Move 6 (down to (8,2)):

- Insert (8,3) → [ (8,3) ].

- Remove → empty.

Move 7 (down to (8,1)):

- Insert (8,2) → [ (8,2) ].

- Remove → empty.

Move 8 (down to (8,0)):

- Insert (8,1) into body → [ (8,1) ].

- Since the head is at (8,0), which is the apple's position, the snake eats the apple. So the body is now [ (8,1) ] (from inserting the old head) and the tail is not removed. So the body is [ (8,1) ].

Now, the snake's full body is [ (8,0) ] (head) + [ (8,1) ] (body). So the snake is length 2. Now, the next move (after eating the apple) would be the 9th move. But the problem is whether the snake can move after that. However, the problem only requires reaching the apple, not moving beyond. But the question is about the path to the apple. So the initial moves are safe.

But wait, when the snake is at (8,5) and moves down, the body is empty. So the snake can move down without issues. However, after eating the apple, the body is now [ (8,1) ], and the head is at (8,0). So when the snake moves again, the next move would be inserting the old head (8,0) into the body, making the body [ (8,0), (8,1) ], and then since the apple was not eaten (the apple was eaten in the previous move), the tail is removed. So the body becomes [ (8,0) ].

But that's after the apple was eaten. However, the problem doesn't require moving after eating the apple, only to reach the apple. So the initial path is safe.

But is there a problem with the movement steps? For example, when moving from (8,5) to (8,4), the body is empty. So the head is at (8,4) and the body is empty. No collision. Similarly for the other steps.

So the path of moving right three times and then down five times should be safe. However, the problem is that the movement steps must not cause the snake to hit itself when the body is growing. But in this case, since the body is only non-empty after eating the apple, and the apple is at the end of the path, the initial steps are safe.

But wait, when the snake is at (8,5) and moves down to (8,4), the body is empty. So the head is at (8,4), and the body is empty. So no collision. Similarly, moving down to (8,3), etc. So the entire path is safe. Therefore, the moves are: right, right, right, down, down, down, down, down.

But let's check for any possible collision. For example, when moving from (8,5) to (8,4), the head is at (8,4), and the body is empty. So no problem.

Another possible issue is that when the snake is at (8,0), the body is [ (8,1) ]. So the next move (if any) would have to avoid moving into (8,1), but since the problem only requires reaching the apple, this is not an issue.

Therefore, the moves should be possible. However, perhaps the problem requires that after eating the apple, the snake can still move, but the question only asks to reach the apple. So the answer is the sequence of moves: Right, Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down, Down.

But let's check if the movement is allowed. For example, moving directly down from (8,5) to (8,0) would take 5 steps. But the snake can do that.

But another consideration: the snake must not move into itself. However, since the body is empty until the apple is eaten, and the apple is only eaten at the end, the movement is safe.

Therefore, the path is possible with those moves.

However, another possible approach is to move down first, then right. But that would require moving down from (5,5) to (5,0) first, which is five steps down, then three steps right. However, moving down first would take the snake to (5,0), then right to (8,0). But in that case, when the snake is moving down, the head is moving from (5,5) to (5,4), etc., and the body is empty. So that should be safe as well. However, the problem is that after eating the apple, the body is [ (5,0) ] (if moving down first). But the snake is at (8,0), so when moving from (5,0) to (6,0), etc., the body would be [ (5,0) ], and the snake would have to avoid that position.

But in both cases, the initial movement is safe. So either path is possible.

But the problem is to find a valid path. Either way, the moves are possible.

But let's check the first approach again. The path is 3 right and 5 down. That's 8 moves. The second approach is 5 down and 3 right, which is also 8 moves. Either way, the snake reaches the apple.

But perhaps there's a problem with the movement order. For example, when moving down first, the snake could end up with a body that is in the way when moving right. But since the body is only added after eating the apple, and the apple is at the end, the movement should be safe.

So the answer is a sequence of moves: right three times, then down five times. The moves would be R, R, R, D, D, D, D, D.

But the problem might require that the snake can move after eating the apple. However, the question doesn't specify that. It just asks to reach the apple. Therefore, the answer is the sequence of moves as described.

Another thing to check: the snake's movement must not cause it to move into itself during the initial steps. Since the body is empty, the snake's head can move freely. So the initial path is valid.

Thus, the answer is: the snake moves right three times, then down five times.
</think>

To determine a valid path for the snake to reach the apple at position (8, 0) starting from (5, 5), we analyze the movement rules and the state of the snake's body throughout the journey.

### 🐍 Initial Setup and Movement Rules Recap

- **Starting Position**: (5, 5)
- **Apple Position**: (8, 0)
- **Snake Body**: Initially empty
- **Movement Rules**:
  - The snake moves one step at a time.
  - After each move, the **old head** is added to the **body**.
  - If **no apple is eaten**, the **last element of the body** is **removed** (i.e., the snake remains the same length).
  - If **apple is eaten**, the body is **not reduced**, and the snake grows by one segment.

---

### ✅ Path Analysis

The goal is to move from (5, 5) to (8, 0) in a way that is **collision-free** and **adheres to the movement rules**.

#### 📏 Distance to Cover
- **Horizontal (x)**: From x = 5 to x = 8 → **3 steps to the right**
- **Vertical (y)**: From y = 5 to y = 0 → **5 steps down**

#### 🔄 Movement Strategy
Since the **body is initially empty**, any movement is **safe** as long as the snake does **not move into itself**. That is only a concern **after** the snake has eaten the apple.

Thus, the **simplest and most direct** path is to:

1. Move **right 3 times** to reach (8, 5)
2. Then move **down 5 times** to reach (8, 0)

This path is **collision-free** and meets all conditions.
