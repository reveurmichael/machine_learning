========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from (5,5) to eat the apple at (9,4). The grid is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right.

First, the head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (9,4). So, I need to calculate the direction and number of moves required. Looking at the x-coordinate: 5 to 9 means moving right four times. For the y-coordinate: 5 to 4 means moving down once. But since movement in one direction affects the other, I have to plan a path that doesn't cause collisions with the body or walls.

The current direction is "NONE", so any first move is allowed except for reversing, but since it's NONE, all directions are possible. However, the next moves can't be opposite of the previous direction.

Let me consider the shortest path: moving right four times and down once. But I need to make sure that each step doesn't cause the head to collide with any body segments or go out of bounds.

The snake's current body is empty, so it's just the head. So initially, there are no body segments in the way. That makes things easier for the first few moves.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5).
2. Then RIGHT again to (7,5).
3. Another RIGHT to (8,5).
4. And another RIGHT to (9,5).
5. Now, I need to move DOWN once to reach (9,4).

Wait, but moving down from (9,5) would take me to (9,4), which is the apple's position. So that's perfect.

So the moves would be: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN.

I should check for any possible collisions. Since there are no body segments except the head, and each move is within bounds, this seems safe. Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so the new body will include the old positions, but since we're moving towards the apple without any blocking body parts initially, it's okay.

Another thing to consider: After eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn. But since we've reached the apple in five moves, the next move after that would depend on where the tail is. However, as per the rules, when the snake eats the apple, the body grows without removing the tail, so the next move should still have space.

So I think this path works.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves right four times to align horizontally with the apple and then down once to reach it, avoiding any collisions as there are no body segments present initially."
}
