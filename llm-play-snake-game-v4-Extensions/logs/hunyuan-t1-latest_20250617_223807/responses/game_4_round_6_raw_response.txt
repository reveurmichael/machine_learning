========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly to the right of the head (x=8 vs x=3, y=4). Moving RIGHT repeatedly avoids collisions with the snake's body (which is initially below the head) and stays within grid bounds. Each move shifts the body forward, and after reaching the apple, there are safe subsequent moves (e.g., UP or RIGHT) preventing entrapment."
