========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move LEFT 6 times (from x=7 to x=1) and UP 3 times (from y=3 to y=6). Starting with LEFT moves avoids reversing direction and navigates left safely. After reaching x=1, moving UP avoids body collisions as the path clears. Post-apple, there are valid moves (e.g., UP, LEFT, RIGHT) preventing entrapment."
