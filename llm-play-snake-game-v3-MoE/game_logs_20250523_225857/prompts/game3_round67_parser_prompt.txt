You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with itself and following all the movement rules.

First, I'll note down the initial conditions:

- **Head position**: (3,8)
- **Current direction**: "UP"
- **Body cells**: [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (9,5)] — this means the snake is in a vertical line along y=7 and y=6 towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- **Apple position**: (3,3)

The snake's body is quite long, extending from column 3 to column 9 in row 8. The head is at (3,8), which is near the top-right corner. The apple is located at (3,3), directly below the head but several units away.

Given the current direction is "UP", the snake cannot reverse direction on the first move. So the initial possible moves are either continuing to go up or moving right. However, moving up from (3,8) would take it beyond the grid since y=9 is the maximum. Therefore, the only valid first move without reversing is "RIGHT" towards (4,8).

From there, the snake needs to navigate through a maze of its own body segments and avoid walls while trying to reach the apple at (3,3). The path must be carefully planned to ensure that each move doesn't cause a collision with any part of the snake's body except when eating the apple.

One key consideration is the length of the snake. Since the snake's body is extensive, moving around it will require careful planning to avoid blocking its own path. Additionally, after eating the apple, the snake must have at least one more move left to prevent trapping.

The Manhattan distance from the head to the apple is (3-3) + (8-3) = 5 units downward. However, due to the snake's body occupying several cells in the top-right area, a direct path south might not be feasible. The snake will need to maneuver around its own body towards the apple.

Considering these factors, the optimal path would involve moving right as much as possible while avoiding collisions and then turning downwards to reach the apple. Each move should check for potential collisions with the current body segments and ensure that after each step, the snake remains in a valid position.

After several moves to the right, the snake can turn downward and approach the apple from the side. It's crucial to avoid the body segments that are moving forward and to leave enough space to maneuver without getting stuck.

Finally, ensuring that after eating the apple, there's still a possible path for the next move is essential. This might involve leaving some cells empty or making sure that the snake doesn't get trapped by its own body.

In summary, the snake should:

1. Move right as much as possible to clear space on the top side.
2. Turn downward and approach the apple while avoiding collisions with its body.
3. Ensure each move is safe and avoids walls and other body parts.

This step-by-step approach should help the snake reach the apple safely without violating any movement rules or causing self-collisions.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts by moving right to clear space, then moves down towards the apple, ensuring it avoids collisions with its body. After eating the apple, it turns left to safely reach the target."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 8) and whose body cells are in list format [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)], to eat the apple at (3, 3).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
