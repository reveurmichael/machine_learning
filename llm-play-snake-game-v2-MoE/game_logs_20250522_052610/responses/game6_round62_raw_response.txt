========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I need to help this snake eat the apple at (0,2) from its current position at (2,2). Let's break down the problem.

First, the head is at (2,2), and the apple is directly two units to the left. So, ideally, the snake should move LEFT twice. But I can't just plan that without considering the body and possible collisions.

Looking at the body cells: [(7,4), (6,4), ..., (2,3)]. This means the snake's body is a line stretching from (7,4) down to (2,3). The head is moving DOWN, but wait, the current direction is DOWN. Oh no, because if I try to move LEFT first, that would be a 180-degree turn from DOWN, which isn't allowed unless the direction is NONE.

Wait, current direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP. But in this case, moving LEFT or RIGHT might be possible as long as it's not opposite. Let me check: the movement rules say that you can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. So from DOWN, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or stay DOWN.

But wait, in this case, moving directly to the apple would require two LEFT moves. However, after each move, the body shifts, which might cause a collision.

Let me think about each possible first move:

Option 1: Move LEFT. From (2,2) to (1,2). But I need to check if that's safe. The body is at [(7,4), (6,4), ..., (2,3)]. So the new head would be (1,2). Does this collide with any body part? The body doesn't include (1,2), so it's safe.

But wait, after moving LEFT, the direction changes to LEFT. Then, for the next move, I can go LEFT again because the current direction is now LEFT. So two moves: LEFT, LEFT. But let's check if that's allowed without reversing direction.

Wait, initial direction is DOWN. First move is LEFT—allowed because it's not opposite. After moving LEFT once, the direction becomes LEFT, so next move can be LEFT or other directions except RIGHT (since that would reverse). So yes, two LEFTs are possible.

But wait, when I move LEFT from (2,2) to (1,2), then the body shifts: the head is now at (1,2), and the previous head becomes part of the body. The body after first move would be [(7,4), ..., (2,3), (2,2)]. So when moving again LEFT to (0,2), I need to ensure that (0,2) isn't in the body.

But wait, after the first move, the snake's body is longer because it didn't eat an apple yet. Let me clarify: the body cells given exclude the head. So initially, the body is those 7 cells plus the head at (2,2). When moving LEFT, the new head is (1,2), and the previous body parts shift. The tail would be removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, in this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so after each move, the tail is removed. So let's think step by step:

Initial state:
Head: (2,2)
Body: [(7,4), (6,4), ..., (2,3)] → that's 7 cells.

First move: LEFT to (1,2). Now, new head is (1,2). The body becomes [(7,4), (6,4), ..., (2,3), (2,2)]. But since the apple hasn't been eaten yet, the tail is removed. So after this move, the body would be the previous 7 cells plus the new head, but removing the oldest tail.

Wait, no: when you move, the new head is added to the front, and the old head becomes part of the body. The tail is only kept if an apple is eaten. So in normal movement without eating, each move shifts all body segments forward, and the tail is removed.

So initial body after first move (LEFT) would be:

New head: (1,2)
Body: [(7,4), (6,4), ..., (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)] → but since we didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. So total body length remains 7.

Wait, initial body was 7 cells. After moving, it's still 7 cells, so the new head is added and the oldest cell (the one at (7,4)) is removed? Or does the entire body shift forward?

Actually, when the snake moves, each segment follows the next. So if the snake was in a straight line from (7,4) to (2,3), moving LEFT would cause all segments to move accordingly.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about after the first move: new head is (1,2). The body will now be [(6,4), (5,4), ..., (2,3), (2,2)]. So the snake has moved LEFT, and its body includes all previous positions except the old head, which becomes part of the body.

But wait, no—the initial body is from (7,4) to (2,3). When moving LEFT, each segment moves in the direction. So the segment at (7,4) can't move because it's blocked by the grid? Wait, no—each segment follows the one ahead. So after moving LEFT, the head goes to (1,2), and each body part moves into the position of the previous one.

Wait, maybe I should draw this:

Initial positions:
Head: (2,2)
Body: (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3)

After moving LEFT once to (1,2):
New head: (1,2)
Body becomes:
(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)
But since we didn't eat the apple, the tail (which was at (7,4)) is removed. So now the body is 7 cells as before.

So in this new state, the snake's body includes (6,4) down to (2,3) and (2,2). Now, when moving again LEFT to (0,2), we need to check if any part of the body is at (0,2). The current body doesn't include (0,2), so it's safe.

But wait, after the second move, what happens? New head is (0,2), and the body becomes:

(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)

Again, since no apple is eaten, the tail at (6,4) is removed. So it's safe.

But wait, after moving to (0,2), the snake would eat the apple because that's where the apple is. Then, in the next move, the body doesn't shrink. But in our case, we only need two moves: LEFT and then LEFT again. Wait no—because the first move brings us to (1,2) without eating, but the second move takes us to (0,2), which is where the apple is.

So after moving to (0,2), that's when the snake eats the apple, so the body grows by one segment, meaning it doesn't shrink. So in this case, after two moves: first LEFT, then LEFT again.

But wait, can we do that? Let's check if each move is allowed without reversing direction.

Current direction is DOWN. The first move can be LEFT (allowed because it's not the opposite of DOWN). Then, from LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So moving another LEFT is fine.

So moves would be ["LEFT", "LEFT"], which gets us to (0,2) and eat the apple.

But wait, let me double-check:

- After first move: (1,2), direction is LEFT.
- Second move: (0,2), which is where the apple is. So we eat it, and the body grows, so no tail removal.

So this path works, but I need to ensure that during both moves, there's no collision with walls or body.

Another thought: Are there any obstacles in the way? The initial body parts are at higher y-values (like 4) down to (2,3). So moving left from (2,2) towards (0,2) doesn't interfere with these body parts because they're either above or same level but further right.

Wait, after the first move, the body includes (6,4), which is at y=4. The new head is at (1,2), and the body segments are at higher y's, so no collision.

Yes, this path seems safe.

The snake can safely move LEFT twice to reach the apple without colliding with its body or walls.

{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving LEFT twice safely navigates from (2,2) to (0,2), avoiding collisions with the body and grid boundaries."
}
