========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 6 times and down 1 time to reach the apple at (9,2). Starting from (3,3) with direction UP, the first move RIGHT avoids body collisions and aligns with the target. Subsequent RIGHT moves progress toward the apple's x-coordinate (9), while the final DOWN move reaches the apple's y-coordinate (2). Each move checks for body collisions and stays within grid bounds. After eating the apple, there are safe moves (e.g., DOWN or LEFT) to avoid trapping."
