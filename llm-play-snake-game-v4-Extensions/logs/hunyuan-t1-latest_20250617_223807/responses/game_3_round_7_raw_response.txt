========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left (from x=5 to x=4) and down (from y=6 to y=3). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing direction and moves toward the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent DOWN moves reduce the y-coordinate, aligning with the apple's position. Each step checks for collisions with the body (initially along y=7, so early moves are safe) and stays within bounds. After reaching the apple, the snake can continue moving safely (e.g., DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) as the next positions are unobstructed."
