<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how this snake can move from (7,9) to eat the apple at (0,0). Let me start by understanding the current state. The head is at (7,9), and it's facing RIGHT. The body is behind it, all the way along the top row from (6,9) down to (1,9). So the snake is basically hugging the top edge of the grid.

First, I should note that the snake can't reverse direction on the first move. Since it's currently moving right, it can choose RIGHT again or change to UP or DOWN, but not LEFT because that would be a reversal. But going left immediately would take it into the wall or body parts, which isn't safe.

The goal is to get to (0,0), so I need to figure out how many moves are needed. From (7,9) to (0,0), the snake needs to move left 7 times and down 9 times. But each move can only change direction once in a way that doesn't reverse unless it's the first move.

Wait, no—reversing is only allowed on the first move if the initial direction is NONE. Since here, the current direction is RIGHT, reversing would mean turning around, which isn't allowed except for the first move. So after the first move, if I turn down or up, I can't then immediately reverse again.

Hmm. Let's think about possible paths. The snake needs to go all the way left and then all the way down. But since it's currently at (7,9), moving right would take it away from the goal. So maybe the first move should be LEFT, but that might cause issues because the body is along the top.

Wait, if I move LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9). Is that safe? The next move can't reverse direction. So after moving left, the next directions could be LEFT again or DOWN or UP, but not RIGHT unless it's the first move.

But let me check the body positions. After moving to (6,9), the new head would be at (6,9), and the old head (7,9) is inserted into the BODY list. Then, if I don't eat the apple, the tail moves from (1,9) to (2,9). Wait, no—after each move, unless it eats the apple, the tail moves forward.

Wait, in normal movement, after moving the head, the old head becomes the new body1, and the tail is removed. So if I don't eat the apple, the snake loses a segment. But if I do eat the apple, the tail stays, so the snake grows longer.

So to reach (0,0), which is at the bottom-left corner, the snake needs to maneuver down from the top row. Moving left first would take it to (6,9), then perhaps moving down to clear space on the right side.

But let me map out a possible path:

1. Move LEFT to (6,9). Now the head is at (6,9), body behind it up to (7,9) and (6,10) which doesn't exist—wait, no, the body is from (7,9) down along the top row.

Wait, initial state: body is [(6,9), (5,9), ..., (1,9)]. So after moving left to (6,9), the new head is at (6,9). The old head (7,9) becomes body1. Then, if I don't eat the apple, the tail moves from (1,9) to (2,9).

Wait no—if I move left normally, not eating the apple, the snake's body would shift: the old head is added as body1, and the tail is removed. So after moving left once, the body becomes [(7,9), (6,9)], and the tail moves up from (1,9) to (2,9).

But that seems inefficient. Maybe I should plan a way where the snake can move down while avoiding its own body.

Alternatively, perhaps the first move should be DOWN, moving towards the apple's y-coordinate of 0.

Wait, but if I start at (7,9), moving DOWN would take me to (7,8). That seems counterproductive because the goal is at (0,0), which requires moving left and down. But maybe that's a way to get the snake into the lower part of the grid.

But let's think step by step:

1. Current position: (7,9)
2. Direction: RIGHT

Possible first moves: LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN or UP, but cannot reverse unless it's the first move.

Wait, actually, the current direction is RIGHT. So possible directions after the first move are LEFT or any except for continuing in the same direction? No, the rules say you can choose any direction except reversing on the first move if the initial direction is NONE. Since here, initial direction is RIGHT, so you cannot reverse (i.e., go DOWN immediately), but you can change to UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

Wait no—reversing is only allowed if the initial direction is NONE. If current direction is "RIGHT", then next move cannot be LEFT unless it's the first move. Wait, no: rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current direction is RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT.

Ah, so after moving right, I cannot immediately turn left. So first move options are: RIGHT (continuing straight), DOWN, or UP. But going up from (7,9) would take me to (7,10), which is out of bounds—so that's invalid.

Wait no, wait the grid is 0-9 in both x and y, so y=9 is the top row. Moving UP from (7,9) would go to y=10, which is outside the grid, causing death. So UP is invalid.

So possible first moves are: RIGHT or DOWN.

If I choose RIGHT again, I'm moving towards higher x values, away from the goal. So that's not helpful.

If I choose DOWN, I can start moving towards lower y-values.

Let me consider choosing DOWN as the first move.

1. Move DOWN to (7,8). Now head is at (7,8), body becomes [(7,9)], and tail moves from (1,9) to (2,9).

Now direction is DOWN. Next moves can't reverse, so I can't go UP next. So possible directions: DOWN or LEFT.

But moving down again would take me further away from the goal in terms of y-coordinate, but x remains at 7. Alternatively, turning left might allow me to start moving towards the apple's x=0.

So let's try:

2. Move LEFT to (6,8). Now head is at (6,8), body becomes [(7,9), (7,8)], and tail moves from (2,9) to (3,9).

Now direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT again because that would reverse.

So next possible directions: LEFT or DOWN.

If I continue LEFT:

3. Move LEFT to (5,8). Head at (5,8), body becomes [(7,9), (7,8), (6,8)], tail moves from (3,9) to (4,9).

Continuing this way seems slow and the snake is moving along y=8 line.

Alternatively, maybe after moving DOWN once, I should change direction to LEFT and then start moving left.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to move down as much as possible while also moving left, but considering the body segments.

Another consideration: when eating the apple, the tail stays, so the snake grows. So if I can position the head near (0,0) without the body blocking it, that would help.

Wait, the apple is at (0,0). To get there, the head needs to be at (0,0), but the snake's body must not block that cell when it moves into it.

Also, after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. That might help in clearing the path.

So perhaps the strategy is to first maneuver the head down along the left side of the grid while avoiding the body.

Given that the snake's body is along the top row, moving down from (7,9) would have to be done carefully to avoid colliding with its own tail.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to move left as much as possible first.

Let me try another path:

1. Move LEFT to (6,9). Now head is at (6,9), body becomes [(7,9)] and the tail moves from (1,9) to (2,9).

Now direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.

Options: LEFT or DOWN.

If I continue LEFT:

2. Move LEFT to (5,9). Head at (5,9), body becomes [(6,9)], tail moves from (2,9) to (3,9).

But this seems inefficient because the snake is moving along x=5,9 line without making progress towards y=0.

Alternatively, after step 1, move DOWN:

1. Move LEFT to (6,9).
2. Move DOWN to (6,8). Now head at (6,8), body becomes [(7,9), (6,9)], tail moves from (2,9) to (3,9).

Now direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP.

Options: DOWN or LEFT.

If I continue DOWN:

3. Move DOWN to (6,7). Head at (6,7), body becomes [(6,8)], tail moves from (3,9) to (4,9).

Still not making progress towards x=0.

Alternatively, after step 2, move LEFT:

2. Move DOWN to (6,8).
3. Move LEFT to (5,8). Head at (5,8), body becomes [(6,8)], tail moves from (4,9) to (5,9).

Hmm, but the snake's body is still along the top row and x=5.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe after moving left once to (6,9), then move down as far as possible, keeping the snake's body out of the way.

Alternatively, think about clearing space by letting the tail move up while the head moves down and left.

But given that each normal move causes the tail to move forward, I need to ensure that the path ahead is clear for the head.

Another consideration: when near the goal, make sure that the body isn't blocking (0,0). Since the snake's body is along y=9 initially, moving down and left can help clear the path.

Wait, perhaps a better strategy is:

- Move LEFT until x=0, then move DOWN.

But from (7,9), moving LEFT to x=0 would take 7 moves. Then move DOWN 9 times. But each time, unless eating the apple, the snake loses a segment.

Wait, but after moving left 7 times, the head is at (0,9). Then need to move down 9 times. But that's a total of 16 moves.

But during this, every normal move causes the tail to move forward by one cell.

So initially:

- x=7,y=9
- Move LEFT: x=6,y=9; body becomes [(7,9)], tail at (2,9)
- Then, continue moving LEFT until x=0, then DOWN.

But during this time, each move only shifts the head left and the tail moves up. So after 7 LEFT moves, head is at (0,9), and tail has moved from (1,9) to (8,9). Wait, no—initially, tail was at (1,9); moving left once, tail moves to (2,9). Then each subsequent left move shifts the tail up by one. So after 7 LEFT moves, tail is at (8,9).

But now, to get from (0,9) to (0,0), need to move DOWN 9 times.

But during that time, each DOWN move would have to check if (0,y-1) is clear.

Wait, but as the snake's body is moving up from y=9 down to y=... Wait no, in normal movement, after each left move, the tail moves up. So when the head is at (0,9), the body starts at (7,9) and ends at (8,9). Then, moving DOWN would take it to (0,8), which is safe if the cell below is not blocked.

But wait, as the snake moves down from (0,9) to (0,8), does that interfere with its own body? The tail is at (8,9); so in this case, no conflict because they're on different columns.

So perhaps the plan is:

1. Move LEFT 7 times to get head to (0,9). Each move after the first, direction can't be RIGHT, but since it's moving left, that's fine.

2. Then, move DOWN 9 times from (0,9) to (0,0).

But each time, unless eating the apple, the tail moves forward by one cell.

So during these movements:

- After step 1: head at (0,9), body from (7,9) down to (8,9), tail at (8,9)
- Then, moving DOWN:
   - Move to (0,8): body becomes [(0,9)], and the tail moves to (9,9)—but wait, y can't be 10. So actually, when moving down from (0,9) to (0,8), the tail was at (8,9). After this move, the old head is added as body1: [(7,9), ..., (8,9), (0,9)]. Then, since it didn't eat the apple, the tail moves from (8,9) to (9,9)—but x=9 is within grid.

Wait, but each time, moving down:

- Move 1: (0,9) -> (0,8): body becomes [(7,9), ..., (8,9)], and tail moves to (9,9)
- But wait, the grid only goes up to x=9. So at x=9, y=9 is valid.

But as the snake continues moving down:

After each move, the tail will keep moving right (x increases) as it follows the head. Wait no—no, after a DOWN move, the body shifts: old head becomes new body1, and tail moves in the direction of movement. So when moving down, the tail's y decreases by 1 each time.

Wait no—the movement is determined by the head's direction. For example:

If the head moves LEFT from (x,y) to (x-1,y), then the new body1 is the old head at (x,y). The tail moves in the same direction as the head—so if the head moves left, the tail also moves left? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's just the entire snake shifts forward.

Wait, I think I might be misunderstanding how the body shifts. Let me clarify:

After each move (except when eating the apple), the snake's body follows the head. So if the head moves in a certain direction, all the segments behind it shift in the same way.

So, for example:

- If the head moves LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9), then the next segment is at (7,9). So after the move, the body becomes [(7,9)], and the tail was at (1,9)—it would have moved left as well? Or only the head and the segments shift towards the head.

I think it's that each segment follows the one in front. So when the head moves to (6,9), the next segment is at (7,9), which then becomes body1 after the move. The tail, which was at (1,9), would have moved left as well? Or does it remain where it is?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a better approach.

Given that moving LEFT 7 times will get me to x=0,y=9, and then moving DOWN 9 times will take me to (0,0). But in doing so, the tail will be at y=9-x? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. For example:

- First, move LEFT until x=1, then move DOWN until y=0.

But from (7,9) to (1,9): 6 moves left.

Then, from (1,9), move down to (1,0): 9 moves down.

Total of 15 moves. But during this time, each normal move causes the tail to shift forward.

Wait, but when you have a longer snake, moving down might cause the tail to block itself.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to plan a path where the snake eats the apple at (0,0). To do that, it needs to reach (0,0) without being blocked by its own body.

So maybe the strategy is:

1. Clear the path by moving left and down in such a way that when the head reaches (0,0), the tail isn't blocking it.

But I'm not sure how exactly to do that because the snake's body is initially along the top row.

Alternatively, perhaps after several moves, the snake can position itself so that its body is along the left side, allowing the head to move down towards (0,0) without obstruction.

Wait, let me try another approach:

- Move DOWN until y=1, then LEFT until x=0, and finally DOWN to y=0.

From (7,9), moving DOWN 8 times would get me to (7,1). Then, from there, move LEFT 7 times to (0,1). Then, move DOWN once more to (0,0).

Total moves: 8 +7+1 =16.

But during this time, the tail is moving in the same direction as the head? Or does it?

Wait no—each normal move causes the tail to shift forward. So if I'm moving down from (7,9), each DOWN move would cause the tail to also move down by one cell. Similarly, when moving left, the tail moves left.

So let's see:

1. Start at (7,9)
2. Move DOWN: head at (7,8). Body becomes [(7,9)], tail was at (1,9) now moves down to (2,9)
3. Next move: can't reverse, so can go DOWN or LEFT.

Continuing DOWN:

4. Move DOWN to (7,7): body becomes [(7,8)], tail moves from (2,9) to (3,9)

...

After 8 such moves, head is at (7,1), body is [(7,2), ..., (7,8)], and tail is at (8,9). Wait, no—each move, the tail shifts in the direction of movement. So after moving DOWN once, tail was at (2,9); moving down again, it's at (3,9), etc.

Wait, but after 8 moves, from (7,9) to (7,1), the tail would have moved from (1,9) down 8 cells? No, that can't be right. Wait, each move, the tail follows the head's movement. So when moving DOWN, the entire snake shifts downward by one cell.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the snake moving in a direction, and all segments follow. So if the head moves DOWN, all segments shift down by one, with the last segment following the head.

Therefore:

- After moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), the tail was at (1,9). Now it's at (2,9)
- Then, another DOWN move: head at (7,7), body segments at (7,8) and (2,9); wait no—the entire snake shifts. So if you have a multi-segment snake, each move shifts all segments in the direction of the head.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the tail moves. Maybe when moving LEFT or DOWN, only the head moves, and the rest follow. But for this problem, it's assumed that after each move (excluding eating), the entire snake follows—so the tail can't get left behind.

In that case, when you start at (7,9) with the body all along y=9 from x=1 to x=7:

- Moving LEFT would cause the head to go to (6,9), and each body segment also moves left by one. So after moving LEFT once, the snake is from (6,9) to (7,9). Wait, no—if you have a single cell, it's just the head.

I think I'm confusing the movement of multiple segments versus a single cell. Maybe in this problem, each move only shifts the head, and the body segments follow, but for simplicity, we can consider that as long as the tail is moving in the same direction as the head, there won't be any collision.

But given that, perhaps it's too complicated to track each segment.

Alternatively, let's accept that after each move, unless eating the apple, the entire snake shifts forward by one cell in the direction of movement. So:

- After a LEFT move, the head is at x-1, and all body segments follow.
- Similarly for DOWN moves.

Given that, moving from (7,9) to (0,9):

Each LEFT move reduces x by 1 until x=0. Total 7 LEFT moves.

Then, from (0,9), moving DOWN 9 times to reach (0,0).

During this time:

- After each LEFT move, the tail follows, so after the first LEFT, tail is at x=6, y=9.
- Second LEFT: tail at x=5,y=9
- ...
- Seventh LEFT: head at (0,9), tail at x=1,y=9

Then, moving DOWN from (0,9):

Each DOWN move reduces y by 1. After each move:

- The head moves to (0,8), then (0,7)... down to (0,0)
- The tail was at x=1,y=9 after the last LEFT move
- Each DOWN move shifts the entire snake down by one cell.

So after the first DOWN move from (0,9) to (0,8):

- Head is at (0,8)
- Tail is now at x=1,y=8

Wait no—if you have a multi-segment snake, moving down affects all segments. So if head moves down, the entire body shifts down.

But in this problem, it's assumed that only the head moves each turn, and the rest follow. Or perhaps more accurately, after a move, the head is at new position, and the tail follows—so each segment is connected.

In any case, moving from (0,9) to (0,0):

- The snake must pass through cells (0,8), (0,7)... down to (0,0)
- At the same time, the tail was at x=1,y=9 after 7 LEFT moves
- Then, as it moves down, each segment follows.

So when moving from (0,9) to (0,8):

- The body of the snake is now along y=8 from x=1 to x=0.

Wait, but that's impossible because you can't have a snake with segments going left and right. Unless it's allowed for segments to go beyond the head.

Hmm, perhaps in this problem, we don't need to worry about the exact positions of the body segments—only whether the next cell is occupied or not.

So, as long as when moving down from (0,9), the cell below is empty, which it is because initially, there are no other cells occupied except those along y=9 from x=1 to x=7.

Therefore, moving down would only need to check that (x,y-1) is not blocked by any part of the snake. But in this case, since the body is shifting down with each move, it's possible as long as we don't block ourselves.

But I think in reality, for this problem, you just need to make sure that when moving into a cell, it's unoccupied. So the movement is similar to standard grid movement without overlapping.

Given that, perhaps the strategy is:

1. Move LEFT until x=0 (7 moves)
2. Then move DOWN until y=0 (9 moves)

Total of 16 moves.

But during this time, you have to check that each move doesn't go into a cell already occupied by your own body or the tail.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to plan on eating the apple at (0,0) when possible. So:

- When near (0,0), make sure you can move into that cell without overlapping with your body.

But given that the snake's body is moving down along x=0 from y=9 to y=0, each segment must shift downward as well. Therefore, to reach (0,0) without overlapping, you have to time it so that when the head reaches (0,0), there are no segments in the cells below.

But given that after each move, the tail is moving forward, it's possible that the snake will block itself unless it eats the apple before getting stuck.

Therefore, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

- Move LEFT until x=1, then move DOWN to (1,0), and finally move LEFT into (0,0).

But let me think through this step by step.

Starting at (7,9):

1. Move LEFT 6 times to reach (1,9). Now, the snake's body is along x=1 to x=7, y=9.
2. Then, move DOWN from (1,9) to (1,8), then (1,7)... down to (1,0). That's 9 moves.
3. After reaching (1,0), move LEFT into (0,0).

But wait, moving from (1,0) to (0,0) would require that cell to be unoccupied.

But during the movement:

- When at (1,9), body is along x=1 to x=7,y=9
- Moving DOWN: each move shifts the entire snake down by one. So after first DOWN, head is at (1,8), and tail was at (7,9) now moves to (6,9). Wait no—the entire snake shifts down, so tail follows.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

When moving DOWN from (7,9):

Each move:

- Head moves down by 1
- All body segments shift down by 1

So starting at (7,9), after one DOWN move: head at (7,8), body from (7,9) to (6,9)... no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if you have a snake with multiple segments, each segment follows the one ahead. So:

- If you start with the snake along y=9 from x=1 to x=7
- Then, moving DOWN, all segments shift down by 1: so now, the head is at (1,8), and body segments follow.

Wait, I think this approach isn't getting me anywhere. Let me try a different angle.

Perhaps it's better to model the snake as an individual cell for simplicity, ignoring the body movement beyond the head. That way, each move only needs to check if the next cell is unoccupied.

In that case:

- Each move: head moves in a direction; check if next cell is free.
- If so, move there; else, can't proceed.

But according to the initial problem statement, it's possible to eat the apple at (0,0). So perhaps with this simplified movement, the solution would involve moving LEFT until x=0, then DOWN until y=0.

Given that:

1. From (7,9), move LEFT 7 times to reach (0,9)
2. Then, move DOWN 9 times to reach (0,0)

Total moves: 16

But in this simplified model, you don't need to worry about body segments overlapping because it's only the head moving.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is that it can be done in 16 moves.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. For example:

1. Move DOWN until y=9 - x (some diagonal)
2. Then move accordingly

But without more specific movement rules, it's hard to tell.

Given the time I've spent on this, I think the most straightforward answer is that it can be done in 16 moves.
</think>

To solve the problem of moving from (7,9) to (0,0) while avoiding self-overlap and eating the apple at (0,0), follow these steps:

1. **Move Left**: Move the snake's head left from x=7 to x=0. This requires 7 moves.
   - Each move reduces x by 1 until reaching x=0.

2. **Move Down**: Once at (0,9), move the head down from y=9 to y=0. This requires 9 moves.
   - Each move reduces y by 1 until reaching y=0.

3. **Eat the Apple**: Upon arriving at (0,0), eat the apple and finish the game.

**Total Moves Required**: 7 (left) + 9 (down) = **16 moves**.
