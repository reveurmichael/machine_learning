========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out a safe path for the snake's head from (8,8) to (7,7). The current direction is "LEFT". Let me start by analyzing the given information.

The snake's body cells are [(9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2), (7,2)]. The head is at (8,8), which is just one cell above the apple at (7,7). Since the snake can't reverse direction on the first move, I need to choose a direction that doesn't immediately make it impossible to reach the apple.

The possible directions are "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Reversing from "LEFT" would mean changing to "RIGHT", but starting with "LEFT" might not be ideal. Let's consider each option:

1. **LEFT**: Moving left from (8,8) would take the snake to (7,8). This is outside the body cells provided, so it's a valid initial move.

2. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (9,8), but since the body has cells at (9,8), that's a collision and invalid.

3. **UP**: Moving up from (8,8) would take the snake to (8,9). The grid only goes up to (9,9), so it's within bounds but moving up from (8,8) isn't helpful as the apple is at (7,7).

4. **DOWN**: Moving down from (8,8) takes the snake to (8,7). That's closer to the apple.

Wait, the initial direction is "LEFT". So I can't choose "RIGHT" next, but choosing "LEFT" first might be necessary if it allows the snake to maneuver towards the apple.

Let me think about the movement step by step. The snake needs to move from (8,8) to (7,7). The shortest path would involve moving left once and then down twice or vice versa.

But I need to ensure that after each move, the body segments don't collide with the head or themselves.

If the snake starts moving LEFT:

- Move 1: From (8,8) to (7,8). Now the head is at (7,8).

- Next, since current direction is "LEFT", the next move can't be "RIGHT". It could be "UP", "DOWN", or continue "LEFT".

But wait, after moving LEFT once, the direction is still "LEFT" unless changed. So if I keep moving left, the snake would go to (6,8), then (5,8), etc., which is not helpful for reaching (7,7). That's moving away from the apple.

Alternatively, maybe after moving LEFT once, I can change direction to DOWN or UP.

But changing direction isn't possible immediately if the current direction is "LEFT". So perhaps the initial move should be a different direction.

Wait, no. The rules say that on the first move, if the current direction is "NONE", any direction can be chosen. But in this case, the current direction is "LEFT". So I cannot reverse to "RIGHT" immediately. Hmm, but can I change direction after the first move?

Wait, the rule says: Must not reverse direction on the first move. So if the initial direction is "LEFT", the next move can't be "RIGHT".

So perhaps a better approach is to move LEFT first, then DOWN, then LEFT again.

But let me visualize this:

1. Move LEFT from (8,8) to (7,8). Now head is at (7,8), direction remains "LEFT".

2. Next move: If I continue LEFT, to (6,8), but that's moving away from the apple. Alternatively, can I change direction here?

No, because after the first move, you're still in "LEFT" direction unless you choose a new direction.

Wait, no—changing direction isn't allowed on the first move, but after that, you can choose any valid direction except reversing.

So from (7,8) with direction "LEFT", I could change to "DOWN" or "UP".

Let me try that:

1. Move LEFT to (7,8). Now at (7,8), still "LEFT".

2. Change direction to DOWN: So next move is DOWN to (7,7). But wait, the apple is at (7,7). So this would allow eating the apple.

But before moving there, I need to check if it's a valid move and doesn't cause any collisions.

Let me see:

After step 1, the body cells are [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7), ..., (7,2)]. The head is at (7,8).

Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,7). Is that a valid move? Yes, because it's within bounds and not occupied by any body cell except perhaps the tail.

Wait, the body cells include (7,2) but not (7,7). So moving to (7,7) is allowed.

Once the head moves to (7,7), which is the apple position, the snake grows. So the body doesn't lose its tail this turn. This means that after eating, the body segments will increase by one, making it longer.

But before that, I need to check if moving to (7,7) would cause any collision.

The head at (7,8) moving down to (7,7). The next move is:

- Insert old head (7,8) into the body cells. So the new body list becomes [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), ... ] plus all other body segments.

But wait, after inserting, when we check for collisions, it's using the state before the body shifts. So the collision check is only against the current body positions except possibly the tail about to move.

So moving to (7,7) would not collide with any body cells because none are in that position except potentially the tail.

Assuming that, after eating, the snake grows. So the new head is (7,7), and the body now includes all previous segments plus the old head at (8,8).

Wait, no—the body list is updated by inserting the old head at the front. Then, since it ate the apple, the tail isn't removed.

So after step 1: body becomes [ (7,8), (8,8), ..., (7,2) ].

Then, moving to (7,7):

- new_head = (7,7). Check collisions: is this within bounds? Yes.

Is it in any body cell except the tail's current cell when that tail will move? The tail before moving was at (7,2), but after inserting the old head, the tail remains at (7,2). So (7,7) isn't occupied by any body cells, so it's safe.

Then, since new_head is apple position, grow: do not remove tail. So the body becomes [ (7,8), (8,8), ..., (7,2) ] plus the old head at (7,8). Wait, no—after moving, the old head (7,8) is inserted into the body, and since it ate the apple, the tail isn't removed. So the new body would be [ (7,8), (8,8), ..., (7,2) ].

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine the movement example provided in the problem statement.

In the movement example where the snake eats the apple:

- The head moves to the apple position.
- Then, insert old head at front of body list.
- Since new_head is apple, grow: do not remove tail. So body length increases by 1.

So after inserting the old head, which was (5,5) in that example, and since it ate the apple, the tail remains, so the body becomes [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), ... ] plus the new head.

Wait, no. The initial state is S = [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ..., TAIL]. After moving, insert old head at front: [旧头, HEAD, BODY1, ..., TAIL]. Then, if new_head is apple, grow: so don't remove the tail.

So in this case:

- Initial body after step 1: [ (7,8), (8,8), ... , (7,2) ]

Then, moving to (7,7):

- Insert old head (7,8): new body list is [ (7,8), (7,8), (8,8), ..., (7,2) ]

But wait, that seems redundant. Maybe it's better to think of the body as:

After step 1, the body is [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), ... , (7,2)]. When moving to (7,7):

- Insert old head (7,8) at front: so body becomes [ (7,8), (7,8), (8,8), ..., (7,2) ]

Then, since it's an apple, grow: don't remove the tail. So body remains as is.

But in this case, the body now has two instances of (7,8). That seems odd, but perhaps that's correct because the head moved there.

Now, after eating, the snake must have at least one legal move next turn to avoid trapping.

So from (7,7), what are the possible directions? The current direction is "DOWN" because after moving down from (7,8) to (7,7).

Wait no: when you change direction, it's allowed except for reversing. So from (7,8), moving DOWN is a valid move.

After eating, the snake can choose any direction except reversing from "DOWN".

So possible directions are "UP", "LEFT", or continue "DOWN".

But to avoid getting stuck, perhaps choosing "DOWN" again would keep it moving towards some area, but actually, since it's at (7,7), maybe there's no need to move further.

Wait, the snake is now at (7,7) with body extending from (7,8) down to (7,2). So it's a vertical line of bodies.

From (7,7), moving DOWN would take it to (7,6), which is outside the body cells and within bounds. Then it can continue moving down further.

Alternatively, moving LEFT or RIGHT could be possible, but given the current position, left or right may lead into other body segments.

Wait, from (7,7):

- Body cells are [ (7,8), (8,8), ..., (7,2) ] plus new head at (7,7).

So to check for collisions:

When moving from (7,7) in any direction, the collision check is against all body cells except possibly the tail.

The tail was at (7,2). So when checking (7,7) + direction, it shouldn't be in [ (7,8), (8,8), ..., (7,2) ].

So for example:

- Moving LEFT: (6,7). Not in body cells. Safe.
- Moving RIGHT: (8,7). Is that a body cell? No, because the snake's body is at (8,8), which is above (8,7).

Wait, no—body cells are [(9,8), (9,7), ..., (7,2)]. So (8,8) is part of the body. But moving to (8,7): that's not a body cell.

Similarly:

- Moving DOWN: (7,6). Not in body.
- Moving UP: (7,8). That's the previous head position and now part of the body. So moving up would collide with (7,8).

Thus, from (7,7), valid moves are LEFT or DOWN.

So the snake can continue moving left towards lower x-coordinates or move down further.

But perhaps it's better to stop here as the goal is achieved—eating the apple. But according to the problem statement, you need to provide a sequence of moves, but I'm not sure if the process stops once the head reaches the apple or continues beyond.

Assuming that eating the apple is sufficient, then moving down to (7,7) could be the last step.

But let's confirm:

The initial move is LEFT from (8,8) to (7,8). Then, change direction to DOWN and move to (7,7).

Wait, but after the first move, you're still in "LEFT" direction. So can you choose a different direction on the next move?

Yes, because reversing isn't allowed only on the first move.

So from (7,8), with direction "LEFT", you can change to "DOWN".

But is that considered a reversal? No, because it's not changing from "LEFT" to "RIGHT". It's changing to "DOWN".

So yes, allowed.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

1. LEFT to (7,8)
2. DOWN to (7,7)

After step 2, eat the apple and grow.

Thus, the moves needed are LEFT then DOWN.

But wait, what happens if after moving to (7,7), the snake is now at the apple and can choose any direction except reversing.

So in this case, since it moved down from "LEFT" to "DOWN", the next move can't be "UP" (reverse of "DOWN"). So options are LEFT or DOWN again or continue with another direction.

But perhaps the minimal path is just two moves: LEFT then DOWN.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first and then LEFT could also work. Let's explore that.

If I start by moving UP from (8,8) to (8,9). But is that helpful? The apple is at (7,7), so moving up isn't directly helpful. Plus, the body extends down from (9,8) to (7,2). So (8,9) might collide with something?

Wait, no—(8,9) is above all body cells except (9,8). But moving UP would take the head to (8,9), which isn't in the body. So that's a valid move.

But from there, what can you do? You have to get back down towards (7,7).

From (8,9), directions available: any except reversing from "UP" (so no "DOWN" on next move). So possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT or continue UP.

But moving further up isn't helpful. Moving left would take you to (7,9), which is above the apple. Then maybe down from there.

Alternatively, moving right to (9,9) and then down. That might work.

Let me try this:

1. Move UP to (8,9)
2. Move RIGHT to (9,9)
3. Move DOWN twice: first to (9,8), which is a body cell—collision! So that's invalid.
Alternatively, from (9,9), move DOWN to (9,8)—collision.

So this path leads to collision at (9,8). Therefore, moving UP first might not be the best option.

Another approach: after step 1, move LEFT instead of RIGHT.

From (8,9):

- Move LEFT to (7,9)
- Then down to (7,8), which is a body cell after the first move? Wait:

After first move: body cells are [(8,8), (9,8), ..., (7,2)]

So moving to (7,9): is that in the body? No. So it's safe.

Then from (7,9), can move DOWN to (7,8). But (7,8) is a body cell now—collision. So invalid.

Alternatively, from (7,9), move LEFT again to (6,9), and then down.

But this seems like it's getting too far away.

So perhaps moving UP first isn't the best approach.

Back to the initial idea: moving LEFT then DOWN seems better because it gets closer to the apple without immediate collision.

Thus, the two moves are LEFT and then DOWN.

Wait, but after step 1, direction is "LEFT". So from (7,8), can I change to "DOWN" as the next move? Yes, that's allowed. So:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,8)
Move 2: DOWN → (7,7)

That should work.

So the sequence would be:

- Move LEFT
- Move DOWN

Thus, the minimal number of moves is two.

But I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause a collision and that after each step, the body remains intact.

First move: LEFT from (8,8) to (7,8). Check if (7,8) is in any body cell except possibly the tail. The body cells are [(9,8), (9,7), ..., (7,2)]. So (7,8) isn't a body cell. Safe.

Second move: DOWN from (7,8) to (7,7). Check if (7,7) is in any body cell except possibly the tail. The body cells are still [(9,8), ..., (7,2)], so (7,7) isn't present. Also, the tail was at (7,2); since we're not removing it after eating, it remains there.

After moving to (7,7):

- Insert old head (7,8) into the body cells.
- Since new_head is apple, do not remove tail: so body becomes [ (7,8), (7,8), (8,8), ..., (7,2) ].

This seems correct. Now, the snake can continue moving from (7,7). Possible directions are LEFT or DOWN, as UP would take it to (7,8) which is now in the body.

So, I think this path works.
</think>

The snake needs to move from (8,8) to (7,7). It cannot reverse direction on the first move, so moving left then down is the optimal path:

1. Move LEFT to (7,8).
2. Change direction to DOWN and move to (7,7).

After eating the apple, the snake can continue moving in valid directions without reversing.

**Answer:** The snake must first move left to (7,8) and then move down to (7,7). So, the moves are LEFT followed by DOWN: $\boxed{\text{LEFT}, \text{DOWN}}$.
