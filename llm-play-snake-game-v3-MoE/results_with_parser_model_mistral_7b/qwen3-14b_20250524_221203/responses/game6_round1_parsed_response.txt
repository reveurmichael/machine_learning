{"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), and does not move diagonally. The shortest sequence of moves that brings the snake's head to the apple is two moves: first move 'RIGHT' to (6, 5) and then move 'DOWN' to (6, 4). This sequence ensures that the snake will reach the apple without colliding with itself."}
