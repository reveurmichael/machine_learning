Okay, I need to figure out a safe path for the snake's head at (5,5) to reach the apple at (6,3). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (5,5), and the body is empty, so it's just the head alone. The direction is NONE, meaning any move is allowed first. The apple is at (6,3), which is to the right and down from the head.

First, I'll calculate the Manhattan distance between the head and the apple. The x-distance is 1 (from 5 to 6) and the y-distance is -2 (from 5 to 3). So the total steps needed are at least 3 moves: one to the right and two downs.

But wait, I have to consider the snake's movement rules. Since the body is empty, moving towards the apple directly should be possible without worrying about collisions except for the walls.

Let me plan a path:

1. Move RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5). This takes care of the x-distance.
2. Then move DOWN to (6,4).
3. Another DOWN to (6,3), which is where the apple is.

But I need to check if this path will cause any collisions with the body or itself. Since the body is empty initially, after each move, the body will adjust accordingly.

Wait, but when moving towards the apple, especially since the first move is RIGHT, then DOWN twice, we have to ensure that after eating the apple (which will make the snake grow), the next move is possible without being trapped.

After eating the apple at step 3, the snake's length becomes 2. So the body will be [(5,5), (6,5)]. Then, when moving to (6,4) and then (6,3), I need to make sure that after each move, the head isn't hitting any part of the body except possibly the tail.

Wait, let me think about this more carefully. The initial moves would be:

- Move RIGHT: new_head is (6,5). Since there's no collision, the body becomes [(5,5)], and since it's eating an apple? No, wait, in this case, the first move isn't towards the apple yet.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me outline each step with the movement rules.

Step 1: Head is at (5,5). Move RIGHT to (6,5).

- Is new_head within bounds? Yes.
- Check collision: The body is empty except for the tail which hasn't moved yet because we're moving normally, not eating an apple. So no collision.

Update body:
- Insert old head (5,5) into body.
- Since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail (which doesn't exist because body was empty). So body remains as [(5,5)]? Wait, no: initial body is empty. After moving right:

New head is (6,5).

Body after step 1:
Insert old head (5,5) at front → body becomes [ (5,5) ].
Since not eating apple, remove tail → but there's nothing to remove because the body was empty. So body stays as [(5,5)].

Wait no: initial S is [HEAD (5,5), BODY]. Since initial body is empty, after moving right:

- New head is (6,5).
- Body becomes [ (5,5) ] but since we didn't eat apple, remove the last element. But the body was empty before inserting old head.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me refer back to the movement update rules.

Movement Update Rule 3:
a. Insert the old head position at front of BODY → becomes BODY1.
b. If new_head == apple, grow; else, move normally (remove tail).

In this case, after moving right:

- The new_head is (6,5), which isn't the apple's position (6,3). So we do step 3b: remove last element of body.

But initial body was empty. After inserting old head, body becomes [ (5,5) ]. Then, since not eating apple, remove tail → but there's only one element in body now. Do we remove it? Or does the body stay as [(5,5)]?

Wait, according to rule 3:
If new_head != apple, then after inserting old head at front, remove last element.

So initial body is empty. Insert old head (5,5) → body becomes [ (5,5) ].
Then remove last element → body becomes empty again because the tail was (5,5), which gets removed. So after first move, the body is empty, and head is at (6,5).

Wait, that can't be right because then moving to (6,5) would have no body, but when you next move down, you'll have a new body.

Let me try step 2:

Head is now at (6,5), body is empty. Next direction: DOWN → y decreases by 1 → (6,4).

- Check collision: new_head (6,4) is within bounds.
- Body after inserting old head (6,5) becomes [ (6,5) ].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body is empty again.

So after second move, head is at (6,4), body is empty.

Third step: Move DOWN again to (6,3).

- new_head is (6,3), which is the apple's position. So we eat it.
- Insert old head (6,4) into body → [ (6,4) ].
- Since new_head == apple, do not remove tail → body becomes [ (6,4) ] plus head.

Wait no: After inserting old head, the body is [ (6,4) ]. Then since eating apple, we don't remove tail. So the new body is [ (6,4) ], and head is at (6,3). So full snake is [ (6,3), (6,4) ].

Now, after this move, the next turn must have a possible movement to avoid death.

So, with the head at (6,3), body [(6,4)], direction was DOWN in previous step. Now, can't reverse direction to UP because that would be reversing from DOWN. So allowed directions are LEFT and RIGHT and same as before, but not directly opposite.

Wait, no: current direction after third move is DOWN. Next move cannot be UP. But what about other directions? Let's see.

But wait, the movement rules say you can't reverse direction. So if previous direction was DOWN, next move can't be UP. Similarly, LEFT can't be followed by RIGHT and vice versa.

In this case, after moving DOWN to (6,3), the next move cannot be UP.

So from (6,3), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or same as before?

Wait, the direction for each step is chosen based on current direction. The initial direction was NONE, so first move can be any. Then, in subsequent moves, you can't reverse.

In our case:

- First move: RIGHT
- Second move: DOWN (from RIGHT allowed)
- Third move: DOWN again (allowed)

Now, next move after third step is from DOWN direction, so can't go UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or same as before.

But the head is at (6,3), and the body is [(6,4)]. The tail is at (6,4). When moving, in the next step, if we choose to move in a direction that makes new_head collide with the body except for the tail's position after it moves.

Wait, when the snake eats an apple, the tail doesn't move. So after eating apple, the body is [ (6,4) ] and head is at (6,3). Next move:

If we choose LEFT from (6,3): new_head would be (5,3).

Check collision: does (5,3) collide with any body except the tail's next position?

The body is [(6,4)], which is not adjacent to (5,3), so no collision. So moving left is safe.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT from (6,3): new_head would be (7,3). Check if that collides with body? The body is [(6,4)] and the tail will move only if not eating apple. But in this case, after eating, next move won't eat an apple unless we choose a direction towards it.

Wait, but from (6,3), moving LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN?

But wait, (6,3) is already at y=3. Down would take us to (6,2), which is outside the grid because y can only go down to 0 and up to 9. Wait no: y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving DOWN from (6,3) is y-1 → (6,2), which is valid.

Wait, but the current direction after third step was DOWN, so next move can't be UP. But DOWN again is allowed?

No, because you can't reverse direction. Wait, no: reversing is only between opposite directions. So moving DOWN again is fine as it's same direction.

But from (6,3), moving DOWN would take us to (6,2). The body after this move would be:

Insert old head (6,3) → body becomes [ (6,3), (6,4) ].

Then, since not eating apple, remove tail (which is at (6,4)), so body becomes [ (6,3) ].

So the new snake would have head at (6,2) and body [(6,3)]. That seems okay.

But after that move, can we continue? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3). But wait, is there any collision?

Body after inserting old head: [ (6,3), (6,4) ].

Then remove tail → body becomes [(6,3)] if not eating apple. So new snake would be head at (7,3), body [(6,3)], which is okay because (7,3) and (6,3) are adjacent but not overlapping.

Wait, no: the body after inserting old head is [ (6,3), (6,4) ], then since we're moving right to (7,3), not eating apple, so remove tail → body becomes [(6,3)]. So new snake is [ (7,3), (6,3) ].

Wait, but (7,3) and (6,3) are adjacent. That's okay because the head can be next to its own body as long as it's not overlapping.

But in any case, I think that choosing a direction after eating the apple is possible without being trapped.

Therefore, my initial plan of moving RIGHT, then DOWN twice seems acceptable.

So the sequence of moves would be:

1. RIGHT → (6,5)
2. DOWN → (6,4)
3. DOWN → (6,3) and eat the apple.

After that, any move can be made except reversing direction.

But wait, what if after eating the apple at step 3, we have to ensure that in the next steps, moving is still possible without collision.

Alternatively, perhaps another path could be better.

Another approach: since we need to go right and down twice, maybe first go down, then right, but I think that would take more steps.

Wait, no: starting at (5,5):

Option 1: RIGHT → (6,5), DOWN→(6,4), DOWN→(6,3). Three moves.

Option 2: DOWN → (5,4), RIGHT→(6,4), DOWN→(6,3). Also three moves.

So both options take same steps.

But considering the movement restrictions after each move in terms of directions, perhaps option 1 is better because it avoids potential future collisions.

Wait, but in option 2:

After first move DOWN to (5,4):

- Body becomes [ (5,5) ].
- Since not eating apple, remove tail → body empty again.

Second move RIGHT to (6,4):

- Insert old head (5,4), so body is [ (5,4) ].
- Not eating apple, remove tail → body empty again.

Third move DOWN to (6,3):

- new_head is at apple's position. So eat it.

Body becomes:

Insert old head (6,4) → body [ (6,4) ], and since eating apple, don't remove tail. So the body remains as [ (6,4) ] and head is at (6,3).

Same situation as before. Next move can be LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN (but not UP), so similar options.

Therefore, both paths seem equally viable in terms of steps and collision risks.

So I think either path is acceptable. But since the initial direction was NONE, starting with RIGHT makes sense because it's the x-direction needed.

But wait, another thought: when moving to (6,5) then (6,4), then (6,3), after eating apple at third step, we are at (6,3). Then, if we try to move further in any direction:

If we choose LEFT, as I said earlier, head moves to (5,3), body becomes [ (6,3) ] → no collision.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT would take us to (7,3); same as before.

Moving DOWN is allowed since previous direction was DOWN. But from (6,3), moving down takes us to (6,2). So yes, that's a valid move.

So in all cases, after eating the apple, we have options for next moves without being trapped.

Therefore, my conclusion is that moving RIGHT, then DOWN twice would work.

But let me write out each step with more detail:

Initial position: head at (5,5), body empty.

Move 1: RIGHT → new_head = (6,5)

- Check collision: no body to collide with.
- Update body: insert old head (5,5) → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body is empty again.

So after move 1: head at (6,5), body empty.

Move 2: DOWN → new_head = (6,4)

- Check collision: no body to collide with.
- Update body: insert old head (6,5) → body becomes [ (6,5) ]
- Remove last element → body is empty again.

After move 2: head at (6,4), body empty.

Move 3: DOWN → new_head = (6,3)

- Check collision: no body to collide with.
- This is apple's position. Eat it.
- Update body: insert old head (6,4) → body becomes [ (6,4) ]
- Since eating apple, do not remove tail.

So after move 3: head at (6,3), body [ (6,4) ]

Now, the snake is of length 2. Next moves must ensure no collision with the body except possibly the tail's new position.

From (6,3), possible directions:

- LEFT to (5,3)
- RIGHT to (7,3)
- DOWN to (6,2)

But can't go UP because previous direction was DOWN; but wait, movement restriction is only against reversing. So if we were moving DOWN, next move cannot be UP.

Wait, no: the rule says you can't reverse direction. So from DOWN, you can't go UP; from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT; etc.

In this case, after move 3, direction was DOWN. So for next move:

- Can't go UP
- Can go LEFT, RIGHT, or same as before (DOWN)

So from (6,3), options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

If we choose LEFT to (5,3):

- new_head = (5,3)
- Check collision: body is [ (6,4) ], which is not adjacent to (5,3). So no collision.
- Update body: insert old head (6,3) → body becomes [ (6,3), (6,4) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail → new body is [ (6,3) ]

So now snake is at (5,3), body [ (6,3) ]. Next move from direction LEFT:

Can't go RIGHT next because it would reverse.

But since previous direction was LEFT, next can't be RIGHT. But I'm not sure if this affects much.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN again after eating the apple.

Wait, no: after third move, we're at (6,3), and moving to (5,3) is a change in direction from DOWN to LEFT.

But movement restrictions only prevent reversing previous direction, so it's allowed.

Therefore, as long as each subsequent move doesn't reverse the previous direction, it's okay.

So I think that the initial plan works. Therefore, the shortest path is RIGHT → DOWN → DOWN, totaling 3 moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple located at a specific coordinate on a grid. The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), but it cannot reverse direction immediately after moving in the opposite direction.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake starts at position (5, 5) and needs to reach the apple at position (6, 3). We need to plan a path that allows the snake to move towards the apple while adhering to movement constraints.
2. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction immediately. For example, if it moves down, it cannot then move up in the next step.
3. **Path Planning**: Calculate the Manhattan distance to determine the minimum number of steps required. The Manhattan distance between (5, 5) and (6, 3) is 1 (right) + 2 (down) = 3 steps.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial position of the snake's head
head = (5, 5)
apple = (6, 3)

# List to keep track of moves
moves = []

# Move right to (6,5)
moves.append("RIGHT")
# Move down to (6,4)
moves.append("DOWN")
# Move down to (6,3) where the apple is located
moves.append("DOWN")

print(moves)
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at (5, 5).
2. **First Move**: Move right to (6, 5). This step covers the horizontal distance towards the apple.
3. **Second Move**: Move down to (6, 4). This step begins covering the vertical distance needed to reach the apple.
4. **Third Move**: Move down again to (6, 3), which is where the apple is located.

This sequence of moves ensures that the snake reaches the apple in the minimum number of steps without violating any movement constraints. The approach efficiently navigates towards the target by breaking down the problem into horizontal and vertical components and ensuring each move is valid according to the given rules.
