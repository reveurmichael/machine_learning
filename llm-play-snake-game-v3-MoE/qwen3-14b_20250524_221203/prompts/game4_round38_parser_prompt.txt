<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (7,8), and the apple is at (0,8). The current direction is UP, and the body is [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]. So the snake is currently moving up, but the apple is directly to the left of the head, same y-coordinate. The challenge is to get the head to (0,8) without colliding with the body or the walls.

First, I need to figure out a path from (7,8) to (0,8). Since the apple is on the same row (y=8), the snake needs to move left multiple times. However, the snake's body is in the way. Let me visualize the body positions. The body segments are at (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5). So from the head (7,8), the body is directly below it at (7,7), then moving left to (6,7), (5,7), and then down to (5,6) and (5,5). So the body is in a vertical line from (7,7) down to (5,5), but the head is at (7,8).

If I try moving left first, the head would go to (6,8). Let's check if that's safe. The body segments are at (7,7) and below. So (6,8) is not occupied by any body parts. But then, the next move would be left again to (5,8), and so on. However, the body is at (5,7), so when moving left to (5,8), the next position would be (5,8), which is adjacent to (5,7). But the body is moving as well. Wait, the body is currently at (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), etc. So when the head moves left, the body shifts. Let me think about the movement steps.

The initial direction is UP. But moving UP from (7,8) would take the head to (7,9), which is outside the grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9, but 9 is the maximum). Wait, the coordinates are from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So moving UP increases y by 1. The head is at (7,8), so moving UP would take it to (7,9), which is valid. Wait, but the grid is 10x10, so coordinates are 0-9 in both x and y. So (7,8) moving up is (7,9) which is valid. However, the apple is at (0,8), so moving up might not be helpful. But the initial direction is UP. However, the user can choose to change direction. But the first move can't be a reversal. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN. But moving left or right is allowed.

Wait, the initial direction is UP, so the next move can't be DOWN. So the first move can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. But moving UP would take the head to (7,9), which is valid. However, the apple is on the same y-coordinate as the head's starting position. So maybe moving left is better. But the problem is that the body is in the way.

Let me think step by step. The head is at (7,8). The body is [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]. So the body is directly below the head at (7,7), then left to (6,7), (5,7), then down to (5,6), (5,5). So the snake is moving upwards, but the body is in a line from (7,7) to (5,5). So if the head moves left, the next position is (6,8), then (5,8), etc. But when moving left, the body will shift. Let's simulate the first few moves.

First move: Let's choose LEFT. New head is (6,8). Check for collisions. The body segments are at (7,7), (6,7), etc. (6,8) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then, the body is updated. The old head (7,8) is inserted into the body list, becoming the new first element. Then, since the new head (6,8) is not the apple position, the tail is removed. The original body was [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]. After inserting (7,8) at the front, the body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]. Then, since the new head is not the apple, the tail (5,5) is removed. So the new body is [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. Now, the head is at (6,8).

Next move: Again, LEFT. New head is (5,8). Check for collisions. The body is [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. The new head (5,8) is not in the body. So that's safe. Insert the old head (6,8) at the front of the body, making it [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. Then, since the new head (5,8) is not the apple, remove the tail (5,6). New body is [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)].

Now the head is at (5,8). Next move: LEFT again to (4,8). Check collisions. The body is [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)]. (4,8) is not in the body. So that's safe. Insert (5,8) into the body, then remove tail. New body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)]. Remove the tail (5,7) → [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)].

Continuing this way, moving left each time. Head moves to (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8). But wait, when the head reaches (0,8), that's the apple. Let's check if that's possible.

But during these moves, the body is shifting. However, the body is moving to the right as the head moves left. Let's see. For example, after a few steps, the body might be in positions that could block the path. Wait, but each time the head moves left, the body shifts forward. Let me think about the body positions as the snake moves left.

But there's a problem. Let's consider when the head is moving left towards (0,8). Suppose the snake is moving left step by step. Let's take the example when the head is at (5,8), and the body is [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)]. Wait, no, earlier steps were inserting the old head into the body. Let me retrace.

Wait, after the first move (head at (6,8)), the body is [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. Then, moving left to (5,8), the body becomes [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)] → then remove tail (5,6) → [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)].

Next move: head moves left to (4,8). Insert (5,8) into body → [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)]. Remove tail (5,7) → [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)].

Next move: head moves to (3,8). Insert (4,8) into body → [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)]. Remove tail (6,7) → [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)].

Continuing this, each time the head moves left, and the body shifts. So the body is moving to the right, but the head is moving left. So the body is following the head's path. However, when the head reaches (0,8), the body would be behind it. Let me check if there's any collision when the head is moving towards the apple.

Wait, but when the head is moving left, the body is moving in the same direction? No, the body is moving forward as the head moves. For example, when the head moves left, the body segments shift forward. So the body is following the head's path. But when the head is at (5,8), the body is [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)] → but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The body is a list of positions that the snake has occupied. When the head moves, the body shifts. So when the head moves left, the new head is added to the front of the body list, and the last element is removed. For example, after the first move:

Original body: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)].

After moving left to (6,8), the new body is [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. Because the old head (7,8) is inserted at the front, and the tail (5,5) is removed.

Then, moving left again to (5,8), the new body is [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)]. So the tail (5,6) is removed.

Continuing, each time the head moves left, the body is the previous head's position, and the tail is removed. So as the head moves left, the body follows the path behind. So when the head is at (0,8), the body is a list of positions that are to the right of the head, but since the head is at (0,8), the body would be [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), ..., (7,8), ... etc.]. But during the movement, the body might be overlapping with the path. However, in this case, the body is moving to the right as the head moves left. So the body is not in the way of the head's path towards the apple.

Wait, but when the head is at (5,8), the body includes (6,8), (7,8), etc. So when the head moves to (4,8), the body is [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), ...]. So the body is to the right of the head. Therefore, as the head moves left, the body is moving forward in the same direction, but the head is moving left, and the body is following. Therefore, there's no collision. So the head can safely move left step by step to (0,8).

But let's check when the head is at (5,8). The body is [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)]. Wait, no. After moving to (5,8), the body would be [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)]. Then, moving left to (4,8), the body becomes [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)] → then remove the tail (6,7), so the body is [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)].

So when the head is at (4,8), the body includes (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), etc. So the body is not blocking the path. Therefore, the head can continue moving left without collision. However, when the head reaches (0,8), the body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), ...], but since the head is at (0,8), which is the apple's position, the snake would have eaten the apple, and the tail would not be removed. Wait, but in the simulation above, when the head reaches (0,8), which is the apple's position, then the tail would not be removed. So the body would be extended, but since the apple is consumed, the snake grows. However, the problem is just to reach the apple, not to grow. But even if the snake grows, as long as there's no collision, it's safe.

But in this case, the path seems safe. So the steps would be: move left 7 times (from x=7 to x=0). Each time, the head moves left, and the body shifts forward. No collision occurs. But wait, when the head is moving left, the body is following. So the body is not in the way. Therefore, this seems feasible.

However, there's a potential problem when the head is moving left and the body is moving in such a way that a body segment might be in the same position as the head. For example, when the head is at (5,8), the body includes (5,8) as the first element. Wait, no. Wait, when the head moves left, the new head is inserted into the body list, and the tail is removed. So after the first move, the body includes (7,8) as the first element. Then, when the head moves to (6,8), the body is [(7,8), (7,7), ...], and when the head moves to (5,8), the body is [(6,8), (7,8), ...], etc. So the body is always one step behind the head. Therefore, the head is not overlapping with any body segments. Hence, this path is safe.

But wait, when the head moves left, the body is following. So the first body segment is the previous head's position. For example, when the head is at (6,8), the first body segment is (7,8), which is the previous head's position. Then, the next body segment is (7,7), etc. So the body is not in the path of the head's movement. Therefore, moving left step by step is safe.

Therefore, the plan is to move left seven times from (7,8) to (0,8). Each move is LEFT, and there's no collision. But let's check for the first few steps again.

First move: head at (7,8) moves left to (6,8). Body is [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. No collision.

Second move: head at (6,8) moves left to (5,8). Body is [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)]. No collision.

Third move: head at (5,8) moves left to (4,8). Body is [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)]. No collision.

Fourth move: head at (4,8) → (3,8). Body is [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)]. No collision.

Fifth move: head at (3,8) → (2,8). Body is [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)]. Wait, but the body length is 5. Wait, initial body length was 5 (original body had 5 segments). When the head moves, the body length remains the same because the tail is removed. Wait, the initial body is [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)] (5 segments). When the head moves, the body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)] (still 5 segments). Then, when moving again, the body becomes [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)] (5 segments). So the body length is always 5. Therefore, when the head is at (5,8), the body is [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)] (5 segments). Then, moving to (4,8), the body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)] (5 segments). So the body is always 5 segments long. Therefore, the body is not overlapping with the head.

So this seems safe. Therefore, the answer is to move left seven times. But the problem is that the user might have to specify the sequence of moves. However, the question is not asking for the sequence of moves, but to determine whether it's possible, and perhaps to explain the path. But the user's question is to provide a thought process, and then the assistant's answer.

But the user might be expecting a specific answer. However, given the analysis, the path is possible by moving left seven times. However, the initial direction is UP, but the first move can be LEFT. The first move can't be DOWN, but LEFT and RIGHT are allowed. Therefore, the answer would be that the snake can move left seven times to reach the apple at (0,8) without collision.

But I need to make sure there's no mistake. Let me check for when the head is at (0,8). At that point, the body would be [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8)]. Wait, no. Because the body has 5 segments. Let's track the body after each move:

Initial body: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)].

Move 1: head moves to (6,8). Body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)].

Move 2: head moves to (5,8). Body becomes [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)].

Move 3: head moves to (4,8). Body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)].

Move 4: head moves to (3,8). Body becomes [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)].

Move 5: head moves to (2,8). Body becomes [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8)].

Move 6: head moves to (1,8). Body becomes [(2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)].

Move 7: head moves to (0,8). Body becomes [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)].

At this point, the head is at (0,8), and the body is [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]. No collision occurs because the head is at (0,8), and the body segments are at (1,8), etc. Therefore, the snake successfully reaches the apple without collision.

Therefore, the answer is that the snake can move left seven times to reach the apple at (0,8).
</think>

The snake can successfully reach the apple at position (0,8) by moving **left seven times**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (7,8), with the body segments at [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)].
2. **Movement**: Each leftward move shifts the head one step to the left (x-coordinate decreases by 1), and the body segments update accordingly by removing the last segment and adding the previous head position to the front.
3. **Collision Check**: After each move, the head's position does not overlap with any body segments. For example:
   - After the first move, the body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)].
   - After the seventh move, the head reaches (0,8), and the body is [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)].
4. **Result**: The snake reaches (0,8) safely, with no collisions between the head and body segments.

**Answer**: The snake can move left seven times to reach the apple at (0,8) without collision.
