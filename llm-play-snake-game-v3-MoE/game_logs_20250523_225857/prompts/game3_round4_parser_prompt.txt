<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake is at (6,7) and needs to reach the apple at (6,8). The current direction is "UP", and the body cells are [(6,6), (6,5)]. 

First, let me visualize the grid. The head is at (6,7), which is one cell down from the top-right corner. The apple is directly above the head at (6,8). The snake's body is moving upwards along the same column: first (6,6) then (6,5). So the snake is currently in a vertical line going downward.

Since the current direction is "UP", the next move can't be "DOWN". It has to be either "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "NONE" on the first move. But moving "UP" again would reverse the direction only if it's not the first move, which isn't allowed because reversing is prohibited unless it's the initial state.

If the snake moves "UP", the head would go to (6,8), which is exactly where the apple is. So eating the apple is possible here. But I need to check the collision rules. When moving into (6,8), does that collide with any body segments except the tail's current position?

The body segments are at (6,6) and (6,5). The new head would be (6,8), which isn't occupied by any of these, so it's safe. Also, the snake's body after this move will grow because it ate the apple.

So after eating, the body length increases by one. The new head is at (6,8), and the old head becomes part of the body. The tail doesn't move because we just grew. So the new body would be [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. 

But wait, after eating, I need to ensure there's a legal move next turn. If the snake is at (6,8) with direction "UP", moving "UP" again isn't possible because it's already on the top row. So the next move can be either "DOWN", "LEFT", or "RIGHT". But since the head is now at (6,8), moving "DOWN" would take it back to (6,7), which might cause a collision if the tail moves into that spot.

Wait, no—the next move after eating, the snake's body is [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. So the head is at (6,8). If I change direction to "DOWN", moving to (6,7) would collide with the new head or any body parts. The new head would be (6,7), which is occupied by the body segment after this move.

Wait, no, because when you eat, the tail doesn't move. So the next step, the body is still [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. Moving "DOWN" from (6,8) to (6,7) would check for collisions before updating the body. Since (6,7) is part of the body except the tail, which is at (6,5). So moving there would cause a collision because it's occupied by BODYi where i is not the tail's current cell.

Hmm, so after eating, if I move "DOWN", that might cause an immediate collision. Therefore, perhaps I should change direction to "RIGHT" or "LEFT". But let's see: from (6,8), moving "RIGHT" would take me to (7,8). Then the next move could be "UP" again, but wait, after eating, can I reverse direction?

No, reversing is only allowed on the first move. So after eating, if the current direction is not "UP", you can't reverse. But in this case, after eating, what's the new direction? Wait, when you eat, the head moves into the apple's position, and then the next turn, the snake has to choose a direction that doesn't reverse unless it's the first move.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me outline the steps again:

1. Current state: head at (6,7), direction "UP", body [(6,6), (6,5)].
2. Move "UP" to (6,8), which is safe and eats the apple.
3. Body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)], since the tail doesn't move when growing.
4. Next turn: need to make a legal move that doesn't reverse direction unless it's the first move.

From (6,8) with direction "UP", possible moves are "DOWN" (not allowed as it's reversing), "LEFT" or "RIGHT". So moving "LEFT" or "RIGHT".

Let me try moving "LEFT" next. New head is (5,8). Check for collisions: (5,8) is within bounds and not in the body except tail. Since the tail is at (6,5), no collision. Then the new body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)] plus inserting old head (6,7). So new body is [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,8)]. Wait, no—after moving, you insert the old head at the front and then move or grow.

Wait, correction: when moving normally (not eating), you remove the tail. But after eating, you don't remove the tail because it grew.

So after eating, the body is [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. Now, next move "LEFT" takes head to (5,8). Check collisions: no body parts are there except possibly the tail at (6,5). So safe. Then, since it's not an apple, remove the tail (6,5) and insert old head (6,7) at front. So new body is [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)]. 

Wait, but that would leave the tail at (5,8). Hmm, maybe I need to track each step more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps moving "RIGHT" first might be better because it keeps the snake in a position where it can continue moving upwards towards the apple if needed. But since the apple is already eaten, that's not necessary.

Wait, no—the apple was eaten on the first move, so after that, the head is at (6,8). From there, moving "RIGHT" or "LEFT" would take the snake away from the apple's row, which might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the best path is to eat the apple by moving up and then change direction to "DOWN".

But wait, when you move "UP" to (6,8), your next turn can't be "DOWN" because that would reverse the initial direction of "UP". So after eating, what's the next direction? It can't be "DOWN", so you have to choose "LEFT" or "RIGHT".

Moving "RIGHT" to (7,8) and then "DOWN" is possible. Let me see:

After moving "UP" to (6,8), direction becomes "UP". Then, on the next turn, since it's not the first move, reversing isn't allowed, so you can't go back down. So from (6,8), direction is "UP", but you can't choose "DOWN".

Therefore, after eating, moving "LEFT" or "RIGHT" is necessary. Let's say I move "LEFT" to (5,8). Then, in the next turn, I can change direction to "UP" again if needed.

Wait, but what about collision? When moving from (6,8) to (5,8), that cell is empty because the body is at [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. So no collision. Then, after that move, the body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,8)]? No, wait—no, when you move normally, you insert the old head and remove the tail.

So moving "LEFT" from (6,8) to (5,8):

- new_head = (5,8)
- check collision: no
- body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)] + inserting (6,7) at front ⇒ [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)] → then remove the tail (6,5) because not eating ⇒ new body is [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)]

Wait, no—if you move to a non-apple cell, you remove the tail. So after moving to (5,8), you add the old head (6,7) at front and then remove the last element of the body.

So initial body is [(6,6), (6,5)] but after eating, it's [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. Then moving "LEFT" would make new_head (5,8). Since it's not an apple, you remove the last element of the body, which is (6,5), and insert (6,7) at front. So new body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)].

That seems okay. Then, next move could be "UP" again if possible. But wait, after moving to (5,8), direction is still "UP"? Or does the direction change based on movement? Hmm, I think the direction can be changed freely unless it's a reverse from the previous direction on the first move.

Wait, no—the direction isn't fixed; you choose each move's direction. So after moving "LEFT" to (5,8), the next move could be "UP", which is allowed as it's not reversing from "LEFT".

So perhaps a possible path is:

1. Move UP to (6,8) – eat apple
2. Move LEFT to (5,8)
3. Move UP to (5,9) – but that's beyond the grid, probably invalid
Alternatively, maybe move DOWN to (6,7), but wait—that would be moving back down, which is reversing.

Wait, after eating, from (6,8), direction is "UP". So next move can't be "DOWN" unless it's the first move. So if you choose "LEFT" or "RIGHT", then next turn you can change direction again.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path would involve moving to the side first before going back down.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

The initial state is:

- Head at (6,7), direction "UP"
- Body: [(6,6), (6,5)]

Possible moves:

Option 1: Move UP to (6,8). This eats the apple.

Now, body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. Next turn, you can move LEFT or RIGHT because you can't reverse direction unless it's the first move.

Suppose I choose "LEFT" next:

- New head: (5,8)
- Check for collisions: no
- Since not eating, remove tail (6,5) and add old head (6,7) to front. Body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)].

Next move: Can choose any direction except reversing from "LEFT" unless it's the first move. So can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, but not BACK if previous direction was LEFT.

Wait, actually, no—reversing is only prohibited on the first move when changing direction. Subsequent moves can reverse as long as it's not on the very first turn.

So from (5,8), direction could be "UP" again. Let me try that:

- Move UP to (5,9): invalid
Alternatively, move DOWN to (5,7). Is that possible?

From (5,8), moving "DOWN" would take us to (5,7). Check for collisions: body is [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)]. So (5,7) isn't occupied by any of these. Then, since it's not an apple, remove the tail (5,8) and add old head (6,7). New body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (5,7)].

Then next move: from (5,7), can we go back UP to (5,8)? Yes, because it's not reversing unless it was the initial direction. So that seems safe.

This is getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a more straightforward path.

Alternatively, perhaps after eating, moving "RIGHT" to (7,8) would allow for a better continuation. Let's see:

- Move UP to (6,8), eat apple
- Move RIGHT to (7,8)
- Next move: can change direction to "UP" or "DOWN"

From (7,8), moving "UP" to (7,9): invalid
Moving "DOWN" to (7,7): possible

So body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (7,8)] after moving RIGHT. Then moving DOWN:

- new_head: (7,7)
- check collisions: no
- remove tail (7,8) and add old head (6,7). New body: [(6,7), (6,6), (7,7)]

Then next move: from (7,7), can move LEFT or RIGHT.

This seems to be going away from the main area. Maybe it's better to just eat the apple on the first move and then move down.

Wait, but moving down from (6,8) would take me back to (6,7). But is that allowed?

After eating, direction is "UP". Next move: if I choose "DOWN", does that reverse the initial direction? Yes, because it's not the first move. So moving DOWN from UP would be reversing, which is prohibited unless it's the first turn.

Therefore, after eating, I can't move "DOWN" because it reverses the direction. So I have to move either LEFT or RIGHT.

Thus, the minimal path seems to be:

1. Move UP to (6,8) – eat apple
2. Move LEFT to (5,8)
3. Then, perhaps move DOWN or something else

Wait, but after moving LEFT, can I then move DOWN? Let's see:

After step 2: head at (5,8), direction "LEFT" (if that's what was chosen). Wait no—direction is chosen each time. So after step 1, direction is "UP". After step 2, choosing "LEFT", so new direction is "LEFT".

Wait, no—the direction isn't tied to the movement; you choose it each turn.

So from (6,8) after eating, direction is still "UP" because that's what was used to move. But next move can be any direction except reversing unless first move.

Wait, no—if I'm at (6,8), and my last movement was UP, but the direction for the next move isn't restricted by the previous direction—it's only restricted on the first turn.

So from (6,8) after eating, I can choose any direction, including "DOWN", as it's not the first move. So perhaps moving DOWN is allowed.

Wait, maybe my earlier assumption was wrong. The only restriction is that on the very first turn, you can't reverse if it's the second direction. After that, you can change directions freely.

So after eating, from (6,8), I can choose "DOWN" even though previous move was UP because it's not the first turn.

Therefore, moving DOWN from (6,8) would take me to (6,7). But is that allowed?

Wait, but (6,7) is part of the body except the tail. The current body after eating is [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. So moving to (6,7) would collide with the body because it's already occupied by a body segment (the old head).

Therefore, moving DOWN from (6,8) would cause collision and thus be invalid.

So that path isn't possible. Therefore, after eating, I have to move either LEFT or RIGHT.

Thus, minimal steps:

1. Move UP to eat the apple.
2. Then move LEFT or RIGHT once.
3. Then perhaps move back DOWN if possible.

But wait, after moving LEFT from (6,8) to (5,8), then on next turn, can I move "DOWN" to (5,7)?

Yes, because direction isn't restricted except for the first move. So:

- Move UP to (6,8)
- Move LEFT to (5,8)
- Then move DOWN to (5,7)

Check collision: no, since body is [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)]. So moving to (5,7) is safe.

Then, from (5,7), can I move UP to (5,8)? Yes, because it's not reversing unless it was the first turn. So:

- Move UP to (5,8)
- Then move LEFT again? Hmm, but that might just oscillate.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN further. But this seems like a longer path.

Given that eating is achieved on the first move, which is valid, and then moving in any direction except reversing unless it's the first turn. So after eating, moving to the side is necessary to avoid being stuck.

But ultimately, the minimal number of moves is two: one to eat the apple by moving UP, and that's it. Because once you've eaten, you can't move DOWN as it would cause collision or reversing.

Wait no—if I just stay at (6,8) after eating, but the game likely requires moving each turn. So you have to make a move each turn.

Therefore, the minimal path is:

1. Move UP to eat the apple.
2. Then move LEFT or RIGHT.
3. Then maybe move DOWN if possible.

But since I need to eat the apple on the first move, that's essential. The rest can be navigating without eating any more apples.

So in terms of steps:

- Turn 1: Move UP to (6,8) – eat apple
- Turn 2: Move LEFT to (5,8)
- Turn 3: Move DOWN to (5,7)
- Turn 4: Move RIGHT to (6,7)
- Turn 5: Move DOWN to (6,6)

But wait, does this cause any collisions?

After eating:

Body is [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. Then moving LEFT to (5,8):

New body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)] + inserting (6,7) at front and removing tail (6,5). So new body: [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)]

Then move DOWN to (5,7): safe.

New body: [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)] → insert (6,7) at front and remove tail (5,8). So new body: [(6,7), (6,6), (5,7)]

Then move RIGHT to (6,7): but (6,7) is already in the body. So collision occurs.

Hmm, that's a problem. Therefore, moving back to (6,7) would cause a collision because it's occupied by the body segment.

So perhaps instead of moving DOWN from (5,8), I should move LEFT again:

- Turn 3: Move LEFT to (4,8)

Then body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (5,8)] → insert (6,7) and remove (5,8). New body: [(6,7), (6,6), (4,8)]

Then move DOWN to (4,7): safe.

Then move RIGHT to (5,7): which is not in the body. So:

- Turn 4: Move LEFT to (4,8)
- Turn 5: Move DOWN to (4,7)
- Turn 6: Move RIGHT to (5,7)

Then check if (5,7) is in the body: current body after moving from (4,7) would have inserted (6,7) and removed (4,8). So new body: [(6,7), (6,6), (4,7)]

Thus, moving to (5,7) is safe.

But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better strategy is to not go back down but instead stay on the same level.

Alternatively, maybe it's impossible to get back without causing collisions. Therefore, perhaps the minimal path is just eating the apple and then staying put isn't possible since you have to move each turn.

But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe after moving LEFT once, you can't go back but have to stay there, which isn't practical.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is just to eat the apple on the first move, as all subsequent moves are optional but required by the game mechanics.

Therefore, considering all this, I think the minimal number of steps to eat the apple is 1: just moving UP.
</think>

The minimal number of moves required to eat the apple is **1**. You simply need to move upwards from (6,7) to (6,8).

However, since each turn requires a movement, after eating the apple on Turn 1, you must make another move on Turn 2. But as explained in the thought process, moving down or right/left would result in collisions or invalid moves. Therefore, considering all possibilities and avoiding collisions, the minimal path is:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Turn 1:** Move Up from (6,7) to (6,8). This action allows you to eat the apple.
2. **Turn 2:** Since you must move again but cannot move Down due to collision and reversing restrictions, your only options are Left or Right. Let's choose Left for this example:
   - Move Left from (6,8) to (5,8).
3. **Turn 3:** Now at (5,8), you can move Down to (5,7) as it doesn't cause a collision.
4. **Turn 4:** From (5,7), moving Right back to (6,7) is possible if the path is clear. However, since (6,7) was your starting point and now has been reoccupied by your body after eating, this might cause an issue. Therefore, instead:
   - Move Left again from (5,8) to (4,8).
5. **Turn 5:** From (4,8), move Down to (4,7).
6. **Turn 6:** From (4,7), move Right to (5,7), which is now safe.

Thus, the apple is eaten in 1 move, but subsequent moves are necessary due to game mechanics, totaling at least 2 turns with one being the eating move.
