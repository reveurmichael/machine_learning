========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to (3,2). The snake can't reverse direction right away, so my first move has to be either up, down, left, or right. Since the apple is at (3,2), which is two squares left and three squares down from the head, I need to plan a path that doesn't block itself.

First, moving right might make sense because it's closer in one direction. If I go right twice, that takes me to (7,5). But then I have to check if that leaves enough space for the snake to turn downward without hitting its body. Alternatively, moving down three times would take me directly towards the apple but might not allow a smooth left turn later.

Wait, maybe moving left first is better because it's shorter in terms of horizontal distance. If I move left once to (4,5), then from there I can go up step by step. But after each move, I need to ensure that the new head position isn't colliding with any body segments except possibly when growing.

I should also consider not reversing direction immediately. Since my current direction is NONE, I have the freedom to choose any first move without worrying about reversing. Let me go left first because it's a shorter path in terms of horizontal distance.

So, moving left once gets me closer. Now from (4,5), if I keep going up each time, that would be three steps: up to (4,6), then up again to (4,7), and then one more step left to (3,2). Wait, no, after moving up twice, I'll be at (4,7), then another move up isn't possible without going out of bounds. Maybe instead, from (4,5), first go right once? No, that might not help.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to move left twice: (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5). Then I can start moving down towards the apple at (3,2). But will this path be clear?

Alternatively, perhaps moving up once from (5,5) to (5,6), then right? No, that might not get me closer.

I think moving left is a safer initial step because it's in line with where I need to go. So first move: LEFT.
</think>

{"moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT"], "reasoning": "Moving left reduces the horizontal distance, allowing subsequent upward moves towards the apple without blocking potential paths."}

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (5,5), and it needs to reach (3,2).

2. **First Move**: Choose LEFT to move horizontally closer.
   - New head position: (4,5).
   - Check for collisions: No body blocks the path.

3. **Second Move**: Choose UP to start moving vertically towards the target.
   - New head position: (4,6). Ensure this cell is clear.

4. **Third Move**: Another UP move brings it closer.
   - New head position: (4,7), which is still within bounds and unoccupied.

5. **Fourth Move**: Change direction to LEFT twice:
   - First LEFT: (3,7).
   - Second LEFT: (2,7). Now aligned horizontally with the target.

6. **Fifth Move**: Final LEFT brings it directly above the apple at (2,7) → (1,7).

Wait, this seems off because moving from 4,5 to 4,6, then up twice would be better. Let me correct:

After reaching (3,5), move DOWN three times:
- From (3,5): UP is blocked; move down towards the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is:

1. Move LEFT: (4,5)
2. Move UP: (4,6)
3. Move UP again: (4,7) – needs to be clear
4. Then LEFT twice: (3,7), then (2,7)

But from there, how do I reach (3,2)? Maybe this approach isn't optimal.

Alternative Plan:

1. Move LEFT once: (4,5)
2. Then UP three times: (4,6), (4,7) – needs to check
   But wait, moving up past 9 is not possible.
   
Wait, the grid goes from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9). So y=9 is the top row.

From (5,5): move LEFT once: (4,5)
Then UP thrice:
(4,6), (4,7), (4,8), but that's four moves. Then maybe turn RIGHT twice and DOWN twice?

This seems complicated; perhaps it's better to try a different initial direction.

Alternative Approach:

1. Move RIGHT first: (6,5)
   - But this is farther away in x-direction.

Not ideal. Another thought: Since the apple is at (3,2), which is below and to the left of the head, maybe moving LEFT twice then DOWN thrice could work.

But need to ensure each step doesn't collide with body or itself.

Final Correct Plan:

1. Move LEFT once to (4,5)
2. Move UP three times: (4,6), (4,7) – but y=9 is the top, so 7 is still valid.
   Wait, from (4,5):
   - Move up once to (4,6)
   - Move up again to (4,7)
   But then can't move further as the next would be out of bounds. Then turn LEFT twice: (3,7), (2,7)

Wait, this leads away from the apple.

Alternatively:

Perhaps a better path is moving DOWN once and then LEFT thrice.

But I think I'm getting confused here. Let's simplify by considering each move step-by-step with proper checks.

Starting at (5,5):

- Possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

Let me try moving LEFT first to get closer in the x-direction:

1. Move LEFT → (4,5)
2. Check for collisions: Body is empty except for head.
3. Update body: Insert new head and remove tail if necessary.

Then from (4,5), next moves could be DOWN thrice towards the apple at (3,2):

But moving down each time:

1. Move UP → (5,6) – but this takes me away in y-direction
Wait, no—if I moved down once from (4,5): (4,4)
Then again to (4,3), then to (4,2)

From there, can turn LEFT twice: (3,2). But need to check if body allows.

This might work. Let's outline:

1. Move LEFT → (4,5)
2. Move DOWN once → (4,4)
3. Move DOWN again → (4,3)
4. Now at (4,3), can move LEFT twice:
   a. Move LEFT to (3,3)
   b. Move LEFT to (2,3)

But from (2,3) moving towards (3,2) would require another step:

5. From (2,3), perhaps move RIGHT once → (3,3)
6. Then UP twice: (3,4), but that's opposite of desired.

Wait, maybe a different path is better.

Alternatively, after reaching (4,3):

1. Move LEFT to (3,3)
2. Now from (3,3), need to move DOWN to reach (3,2).

This seems promising:

Final Path:
["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT"]

But let's verify step-by-step with collision checks.

Step 1: Move LEFT → (4,5). No collisions.
Body becomes [(4,5), old head (5,5)], then remove tail if necessary. Since not eating apple, remove last body segment (the tail at the end of previous step was [(5,5)] before adding new head).

Wait, initial body is empty.

After first move: new_head = (4,5). Add to front → BODY becomes [(4,5)]. No tail removal since no growth. So S is [ (4,5) ].

Step 2: Move DOWN → (4,4). Check for collisions with current body? Current body after step 1 was empty except the new head at (4,5). So moving to (4,4) is safe. Update Body by adding (4,5) in front and removing tail—since not eating apple. Now Body is [(4,5), (4,4)].

Step 3: Move DOWN again → (4,3). Again, check if this cell is occupied. Current body has (4,5) and (4,4)—so moving to (4,3) is safe. Update Body by adding (4,4) in front. Now Body becomes [(4,4), (4,3)].

Step 4: From (4,3), need to move LEFT once → (3,3). Check if this is clear. Current body after step 3 has (4,4) and (4,3)—so moving to (3,3) should be safe unless blocked by future body positions.

After adding (4,3) as new_head, the Body becomes [(4,3), ...], but since it's not eating apple, remove tail. So S is [ (3,3), (4,3) ].

Now from here, next move must avoid getting stuck. To reach (3,2):

Move LEFT once → (2,3). Then need to move UP twice: (2,4), but this may block the way. Alternatively:

Wait, after step 4, S is [ (3,3) ].

Let me re-examine previous steps for possible mistakes.

Actually, in each step when moving and adding new_head to the front of Body, the last element is removed if no growth occurred.

Step-by-step correction:

Initial state: head at (5,5), body empty.
Body = []

Move LEFT → new_head=(4,5)
Add to front of Body → Body=[(4,5)]
Since not eating apple, remove tail. But there was no tail before, so S is now [ (4,5) ].

Next move: DOWN → (4,4). Check if empty.
Body becomes [(4,5), (4,4)]. No collision since body after step 1 had only (4,5).
Since not eating apple, remove last body segment. Now Body=[(4,5)], S is [ (4,4) ].

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the process:

After each move:
- new_head = current head + direction
- add new_head to front of Body
- if growing (apple eaten), keep all of Body; else, remove last segment from Body

So initial step 1: body was empty.
new_head=(4,5). Add to Body → [ (4,5) ]. Since not eating apple, remove last. But Body was empty before adding—so S becomes [(4,5)].

Step 2: move DOWN to (4,4)
Add to front of Body → [ (4,4), (4,5) ]
Since no growth, remove last element → Body=[(4,4)]
S is now [ (4,4) ]

Step3: move DOWN again → (4,3). Add to front → [ (4,3), (4,4) ]. Remove last → Body=[(4,3)]. S is [ (4,3) ].

Now need to move from (4,3) towards apple at (3,2).

Move LEFT once: new_head=(3,3). Add to front of Body→ [(3,3), (4,3)]. Since no growth, remove last → Body=[(3,3)].
S is now [ (3,3) ]

From here:
Next move should be LEFT again but that would take me to (2,3), which isn't necessary. Alternatively:

Move RIGHT once: back to (4,3). Not helpful.

Alternatively, from (3,3):
- move UP → (3,4)
Check for collision with Body.
Body is [ (3,3) ]. So moving up would bring me to (3,4), which is empty. Then add to front→ [(3,4), (3,3)]. Remove last since no growth.

But I need to get to (3,2). From here:
Move UP again → (3,5)
Wait, that's going away from the apple.

Alternatively, after step 4:

S is [ (3,3) ]
Body is [(3,3)]

Next move: LEFT would take me to (2,3).
Is this safe? Body has only (3,3). So yes.
Add new_head=(2,3) → Body=[(2,3), (3,3)]. Remove last → Body=[(2,3)]
S is now [ (2,3) ]

From here:
Move LEFT once would take me to (1,3)
But I need to reach (3,2). Alternatively:

Alternatively, after getting to (2,3):

- Move RIGHT twice: To (3,3), then (4,3)
Wait, but that's backtracking.

Alternative Plan:

Given this complexity and potential confusion in the body segments' management, perhaps moving left once first is not optimal. Let me try another initial move.

Initial Alternative Path:

Move UP first:
- Move UP from (5,5) to (5,6). Add to Body.
Since no apple eaten yet, remove last segment after adding new_head → Body becomes [ (5,6) ]
From here, move LEFT three times: To (4,6), but that seems off.

Not as helpful. Maybe moving RIGHT:

Move RIGHT once from (5,5)→(6,5)
Add to Body → [ (6,5) ]. Remove last since no growth.
Now need to navigate down and left:
From (6,5):
- Move DOWN three times: but y can't go beyond 9. So move to (6,4), (6,3). Then turn LEFT twice.

But this also seems convoluted.

After careful consideration of each step and potential collisions with the body segments, the safest path without reversing direction initially is:

1. Move LEFT
2. Move DOWN thrice
3. Adjust directions accordingly

But to ensure correctness, let's map it out correctly considering Body segment updates after each move.

Correct Final Answer:

["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT"]
