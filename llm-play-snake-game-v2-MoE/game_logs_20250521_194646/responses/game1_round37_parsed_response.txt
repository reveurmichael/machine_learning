{"moves": ["UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The reasoning involves strategically moving up and then right to avoid collisions with our own body, which grows as we move. The initial moves are up to increase the y-coordinate, providing more space to move right without collision. Then, we move right all the way to the target position (9, 5), and finally down to reach the apple at (9, 4). Each move is checked for collisions with the snake's body."}
