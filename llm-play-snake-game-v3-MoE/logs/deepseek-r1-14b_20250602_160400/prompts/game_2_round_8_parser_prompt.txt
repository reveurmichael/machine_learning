<think>
Alright, let's break down how I would approach solving this Snake problem. 

First, I need to understand the current state of the game. The snake's head is at (0,7), and it's moving DOWN. The body cells are [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. So, the snake is quite long—let me count those body segments: there are 6 body parts plus the head, making it a total of 7 segments. The apple is at (1,4), which is somewhere to the right and down from the head.

The goal is to move the head towards the apple without colliding with any part of the body except possibly the tail when moving, and ensuring that after eating the apple, there's still a path for the next move. 

Let me visualize the grid. The snake starts at (0,7), which is on the bottom row, near the left side. The body extends upwards from there—since the head is moving DOWN, but wait, the direction is DOWN, so that might mean the next move would take it further down. But looking at the body cells, they are all above the head, suggesting that maybe I got the initial movement wrong.

Wait a second—the current direction is DOWN. So if the head is at (0,7), moving DOWN would take it to (0,6). However, looking at the body cells: [(0,8), ...], which suggests that the body is extending upwards from the head because after moving DOWN, the next segment is behind the head.

Wait no—the body list starts with the segment immediately behind the head. So if the head is at (0,7) and direction is DOWN, the first body cell would be either to the left or right, but looking at the body cells provided: [(0,8), ...]. That means the body is extending upwards from the head.

So the snake's head is at (0,7). The next segment is at (0,8)—directly above. Then it goes to (1,8), then (2,8), etc., up to (3,9) and then (2,9). So the snake is forming a kind of 'U' shape.

Now, the apple is at (1,4), which is to the right and below the head. The Manhattan distance between (0,7) and (1,4) is |0-1| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps.

I need to plan a path from (0,7) to (1,4), moving in such a way that the snake doesn't collide with its body and grows appropriately when it eats the apple.

First, I should check if there are any immediate collisions. The initial direction is DOWN, so the next move would be towards (0,6). But looking at the body cells, none of them are at (0,6), as they start from (0,8) and go up to (3,9) and then down a bit.

Wait, no—the body list starts with (0,8), which is directly above the head. So if I move DOWN, the new head would be at (0,6). The current body cells are [(0,8), ...], so after moving, the old head (0,7) becomes the first body segment. Then, since we're not eating an apple, the tail (which is the last element in the body list) will move as well.

But wait, when moving normally, after inserting the old head into the body list, if we don't eat the apple, we remove the tail. So the length remains the same unless it's growing.

So for each move, I need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any existing body segments except possibly the one that is about to become the tail and move away.

Now, let me think step by step:

Current position:
- Head: (0,7)
- Direction: DOWN
- Body: [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]
- Apple at (1,4)

The apple is to the right and down. The head is currently in row 7 (y=7). The apple is at y=4, which is three rows below.

But wait, since the grid's top-right is (9,9) and bottom-left is (0,0), moving UP increases y, so from (0,7), moving DOWN would decrease y. So the apple is actually above the head in terms of grid coordinates because lower y is down.

Wait, no—the coordinate system has (0,0) at the bottom-left, so higher y means up. So (0,7) is near the top left, and (1,4) is further to the right and down from there.

So to reach (1,4), I need to move right twice (from x=0 to x=1) and down three times (from y=7 to y=4).

But considering the snake's body is extending upwards, moving down might be safer initially to avoid collision with body parts that are above.

Wait no—if the head is at (0,7), moving DOWN would take it to (0,6). But the body cells are all at higher y positions (8 and 9), so there shouldn't be a collision in the first move if I go down. Let me check:

If I move DOWN from (0,7) to (0,6), which is not occupied by any body part except possibly after movement.

Wait, no—the body list starts with (0,8). So when moving down, the new head is at (0,6). The old head becomes the first body segment. Then the rest of the body shifts accordingly.

But I need to make sure that in this move, the new head doesn't collide with any existing body segments except possibly the tail's current position, which would move away.

In the initial state, the body cells are [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. So none of these are at (0,6). Therefore, moving DOWN is safe as the first move.

So after moving DOWN to (0,6), the body becomes [ (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), ..., (2,9) ] and then we remove the tail if not eating an apple. But since the new head is not at the apple's position yet, we don't grow. So the body will shift: the old head (0,7) becomes the first body segment, and the last segment (2,9) is removed.

But wait, after moving down, the new head is at (0,6), and the body cells become [(0,8), ...], but actually, no—wait, according to the movement rules:

After a normal move (not eating apple):

a. Insert old head into the front of the body list.
b. Remove the last element (tail).

So initial body: [B1=(0,8), B2=(1,8), ..., B6=(2,9)].

After moving DOWN to (0,6):

New head is (0,6). The old head (0,7) becomes B1. Then, since it's a normal move (not eating apple), we remove the last body segment (B6= (2,9)).

So new body list: [ (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9) ].

Wait no—original body is 6 segments; after moving, inserting the old head makes it 7, but then we remove one to keep length same as before. So initial length is 6 body segments plus head = total 7. After move, new body has the old head inserted at front (so now 7) and tail removed, so back to 6.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think again:

- Before moving: Head is (0,7), body list is [B1=(0,8), B2=(1,8), ..., B6=(2,9)].

After move:

- New head is (0,6).
- Insert old head into front of body list: new body becomes [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)].
- Since we didn't eat the apple, remove the last element: so the new body is [ (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9) ].

So now, the snake's head is at (0,6), and the body extends from there. The apple is still at (1,4).

Next, I need to plan a path that gets the head to (1,4) without colliding with any part of the body except possibly the tail.

But wait, after moving DOWN once, I'm now at (0,6). From here, perhaps moving RIGHT towards x=1 would be good because the apple is at x=1.

So let's consider the next move: from (0,6), moving RIGHT to (1,6).

Is that safe?

After moving right, new head is at (1,6).

Check for collision:

The body segments after inserting old head (0,6) would be [ (0,7), ... ].

Wait no—the body list after the first move was [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9)].

So when moving from (0,6) to (1,6):

- New head is at (1,6).
- Check body segments: Are any of them at (1,6)?

No. The current body is [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), ...]. So no collision.

Therefore, moving RIGHT from (0,6) to (1,6) is safe.

Now, the head is at (1,6). Next step: continue moving DOWN towards y=4.

But wait, let's see. From (1,6), perhaps moving down again could be good.

Alternatively, maybe a combination of moves right and down.

Wait, the apple is at (1,4), so I need to move down from y=6 to y=4, which requires two more DOWN moves after moving RIGHT once.

So possible path:

Move 1: DOWN to (0,6)

Move 2: RIGHT to (1,6)

Move 3: DOWN to (1,5)

Move 4: DOWN to (1,4) and eat apple.

Wait, but each move must be in the same direction as the current direction or can we change direction?

No—the initial direction is DOWN. So after moving DOWN once, can I then change direction to RIGHT? Or do I have to continue moving DOWN?

Wait, no—each move is a single step in any direction, but the snake's movement is determined by the next direction chosen.

So from (0,7), moving DOWN to (0,6) is allowed. Then, I can choose to change direction to RIGHT for the next move.

But wait, the current direction is DOWN. So after moving DOWN once, the new direction is still DOWN unless I change it.

Wait no—each move in the game typically changes the direction based on user input. But in this problem, perhaps we're only considering a single sequence of moves without changing direction until necessary. Alternatively, maybe each step can be any direction as long as it's valid and doesn't cause collision.

But for simplicity, let me assume that after moving DOWN once, I can then change direction to RIGHT.

So:

Move 1: DOWN to (0,6)

Now, from (0,6), head is at y=6. Apple is at (1,4).

Next move could be RIGHT to (1,6):

After this move, new head is (1,6). Body segments are [(0,7), ...], no collision.

Then, next move: DOWN to (1,5)

Check body segments:

The body after moving to (1,6) would have the old head inserted and tail removed. So inserting (0,6) into front makes new body list [ (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), ... ].

Wait no—the previous step: After first move (DOWN to 0,6):

- Head is at (0,6)
- Body becomes [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9)]

Then moving RIGHT to (1,6):

- New head is (1,6)
- Insert old head (0,6) into body list: [ (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9) ]
- Remove last element (3,9): so new body is [ (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8) ]

So no collision when moving to (1,6).

Now, from (1,6), moving DOWN to (1,5):

- New head at (1,5)
- Check body: [ (0,6), ... ] None are at (1,5). Safe.

Then, moving DOWN again to (1,4) where the apple is. Now, when the head reaches (1,4), it's on the apple, so we eat it and grow by one segment.

So after eating the apple:

- Head is at (1,4)
- Insert old head (1,5) into body list.
- Since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail; length increases by one.

But I need to check if moving to (1,4) causes any collision with the body except possibly the tail.

Wait, before eating the apple:

Body after previous move was [ (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8) ]

So when we're at (1,5), and then move to (1,4):

- New head is (1,4)
- The body segments are now [ (1,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8) ]

Wait no—when moving from (1,5) to (1,4):

After inserting old head into body list: the new body becomes [ (1,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8) ]

But since we're eating the apple at (1,4), which is where the head moves to.

So during this move:

- New head is (1,4)
- Check if any body segments are at (1,4). The previous body was [ (0,6), ... ] so none. Safe.

Thus, after four moves: DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN—we reach the apple and eat it.

But wait, in this scenario, we've made three moves after starting—DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN. Wait no:

Starting at (0,7). Move 1: DOWN to (0,6). Move 2: RIGHT to (1,6). Move 3: DOWN to (1,5). Move 4: DOWN to (1,4) and eat apple.

So that's four moves in total.

But now, I need to make sure that after each move, the snake doesn't collide with itself except for the tail movement.

Wait another thing—when moving from (0,6) to (1,6), the body list becomes [ (0,7), (0,8), ... ] and then we remove the last segment. Wait no, let me recheck:

After first move (DOWN to 0,6):

- Head: (0,6)
- Body: [ (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9) ] because we inserted the old head and removed the tail.

Then moving RIGHT to (1,6):

- New head: (1,6)
- Insert old head (0,6): body becomes [ (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9) ]
- Remove last segment (3,9): so new body is [ (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8) ]

So no collision when moving to (1,6).

Then, from (1,6), move DOWN to (1,5):

- New head: (1,5)
- Insert old head (1,6): body becomes [ (1,6), (0,6), (0,7), ... ]
- Remove last segment (3,8): new body is [ (1,6), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8) ]

Again, no collision.

Then, move DOWN to (1,4):

- New head: (1,4)
- Insert old head (1,5): body becomes [ (1,5), (1,6), ... ]
- Since we ate the apple, don't remove tail. So new body is longer by one segment.

Now, I need to ensure that after eating the apple, there's still a path for the next move.

But since the problem only requires moving to the apple, perhaps it's sufficient with these four moves.

Alternatively, maybe another path would be better.

Another approach: instead of moving DOWN first, perhaps moving RIGHT initially. Let me see:

Starting at (0,7). If I move RIGHT to (1,7), but wait—the current direction is DOWN. So unless the snake can change direction immediately, which it can't; each movement must be in a straight line or turn.

Wait no—in the game of Snake, you can change direction as long as you don't reverse into yourself. But in this problem, perhaps each move is just a single step in any direction, but I think more likely, each move is a change in direction based on user input, not necessarily following the current direction.

But for the sake of planning, let me see if moving RIGHT first could be better.

Wait, from (0,7), moving RIGHT would take it to (1,7). But looking at the body segments: [(0,8), ...], so (1,7) isn't part of the body. So that's safe.

But then, after moving right to (1,7), I can start moving down towards (1,4).

So let's see:

Move 1: RIGHT to (1,7). Check collision: no.

Body becomes [ (0,8), ... ] inserted with new head at (1,7) and tail removed. Wait no—initial body after moving right would be:

- Head: (1,7)
- Insert old head (0,7): but initially, the snake was at (0,7). So wait, initial state before any move: the snake's body is only at (0,7), assuming it's a single segment.

Wait no—probably not. Typically, a snake starts with multiple segments, but for this problem, perhaps the initial position is just head at (0,7) and the rest is empty. Or maybe the body includes all the segments after the head.

Wait, the problem statement isn't clear on whether the snake has an initial length or it's just a point. But for movement purposes, each step adds a new segment unless food is eaten.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to outline possible moves:

Option 1: DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN

Option 2: RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN

Either could work.

In Option 1, we have four moves.

Alternatively, let's think of a more optimal path. The Manhattan distance from (0,7) to (1,4) is 3 (right 1, down 3). So at least three moves are needed. However, due to the snake's movement constraints and avoiding self-collision, perhaps four moves are necessary.

But I think Option 1 works as described.

Therefore, the sequence of moves would be:

Move 1: DOWN to (0,6)

Move 2: RIGHT to (1,6)

Move 3: DOWN to (1,5)

Move 4: DOWN to (1,4) and eat apple.

Alternatively, if moving RIGHT first is possible without collision, maybe that's better.

But the initial direction was DOWN. So perhaps you can't change direction unless you do so via a turn.

Wait no—the problem doesn't specify any constraints on changing directions; each move can be in any direction as long as it doesn't cause self-collision.

Therefore, moving RIGHT first is allowed if it's safe.

But from (0,7), moving RIGHT to (1,7) is safe because the body is only at [(0,8), ...], so no collision.

Then:

Move 1: RIGHT to (1,7)

Move 2: DOWN to (1,6)

Move 3: DOWN to (1,5)

Move 4: DOWN to (1,4) and eat apple.

Either way, four moves are needed.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a different path could reach the apple faster, but considering the initial position, it's probably minimal steps.

Thus, the answer is that the shortest path requires four moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest path for the snake to move from its starting position at (0, 7) to the food located at (1, 4). The snake can move in any direction as long as it doesn't collide with itself.

### Approach
The snake starts at position (0, 7). The goal is to reach the food at (1, 4) while avoiding self-collision. The Manhattan distance between these two points is calculated by moving right once and down three times, totaling four moves. Each move can be in any direction, allowing us to plan a path that avoids collisions.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the shortest path for the snake to reach the food.

def find_shortest_path(start, end):
    # Starting position (0,7), ending at (1,4)
    # The shortest path involves moving right once and down three times.
    moves = [
        ('right', 1),
        ('down', 3)
    ]
    return moves

# Example usage:
start_position = (0, 7)
end_position = (1, 4)
path = find_shortest_path(start_position, end_position)
print("The shortest path involves moving right once and down three times.")
```

### Explanation
1. **Starting Position**: The snake begins at (0, 7).
2. **Goal Position**: The food is located at (1, 4).
3. **Manhattan Distance**: The distance is calculated as the sum of horizontal and vertical moves needed.
   - Horizontal move: Right from column 0 to 1.
   - Vertical move: Down from row 7 to 4, requiring three steps.

By moving right once and then down three times, the snake efficiently reaches the food without colliding with itself. This approach ensures the shortest path is taken, minimizing unnecessary movements.

## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (1, 4). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
