========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to get the snake from (8,5) to eat the apple at (8,6). Let's look at the given information.

The current head is at (8,5), and the body cells are [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. The direction is "UP", but I can't reverse, so I can't go DOWN immediately. Wait, no—the current direction is "UP", which means the snake was moving upwards before this step. So according to movement rules, I can't choose the opposite direction on the next move. Therefore, my first move cannot be "DOWN".

The apple is at (8,6), which is directly above the head. Since the snake's body is behind it, I need to check if moving up would cause a collision.

Looking at the body cells: [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. The next segment after the head is (8,4). So if I move up to (8,6), that's two steps. Wait, no—each move is one step. So the new head would be (8,6) if I move UP from (8,5).

But wait, the current body cells are [(8,4), ...], which is directly below the head. If I move UP to (8,6), that's a safe position because it's not part of the body except perhaps when considering the tail movement.

Wait, the body list is from BODY1 to BODYN. So in this case, BODY1 is (8,4). The tail is at (7,2). When I move up, new_head is (8,6). Now, check if new_head collides with anyBODYi except possibly the tail's current position when it moves.

In this case, after moving, the body would shift. So the old head becomes part of the body. The body list before movement is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. After inserting the old head, it becomes [ (8,5) ] + [ ... ]. Wait no—the step says to insert the old head at front of the BODY list.

So after moving, new_head is (8,6). The body before movement is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. After inserting the old head (which was (8,5)), the body becomes [ (8,5) ] + existing body. But wait, no—the initial body list is from BODY1 to BODYN, which are behind the head.

Wait, in movement step 3a: Insert the old head position at front of the BODY list. So after moving, the new body would be [old_head] followed by current BODY list.

So when I move UP:

new_head = (8,6).

Check collision: is (8,6) in any of the BODY cells? The body before movement is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. So no, (8,6) isn't part of the current body.

But after inserting old_head (8,5) into the body list, the new_body becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ].

Wait, but during collision check, we only consider the state before body shifts. So in step 2: Check if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

In this case, after moving up, new_head is (8,6). The current BODY cells are [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. So none of these except perhaps (8,5) if it's part of the body. Wait no—the old head is not yet part of the body during this check.

So collision check is safe because new_head (8,6) isn't in any current BODYi. Also, the apple is at (8,6), so moving up would eat it.

Then, since we ate the apple, step 3b: grow—don't remove the tail.

So the body after eating becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ] plus the new head is added, making the full snake as [ (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ].

Wait, no. Let me think again. The body list before movement is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. Inserting the old head at front makes it [ (8,5) ] followed by these. So after inserting, the new body list becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ]. Then, since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So the new body remains as [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) ].

Wait, but after eating, do I add a new segment? Or is it that when I eat, I insert the old head and don't remove the tail. So the body becomes longer by one.

So in this case, moving UP would result in the snake growing to length 6 (since original body was 4 segments plus head).

Now, after eating, the next move must have at least one legal direction. Let's see what happens next.

But since I'm only required to plan up to eating the apple, maybe just one move is sufficient here.

So moving UP seems safe because it leads directly to the apple without collision.

The snake can safely eat the apple by moving "UP". This move doesn't cause any collisions and allows the snake to grow.

{
  "moves": ["UP"],
  "reasoning": "Moving UP from (8,5) to (8,6) is safe as it directly reaches the apple without causing any collisions."
