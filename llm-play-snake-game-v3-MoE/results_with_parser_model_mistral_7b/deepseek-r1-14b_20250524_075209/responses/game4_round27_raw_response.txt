========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (9,9) to eat the apple at (7,6). Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the current state is:
- Head position: (9,9)
- Direction: "UP"
- Body cells: [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]
- Apple position: (7,6)

The snake is at the top-right corner. The body extends down from there. Since the direction is "UP", which would normally mean moving towards higher y-values, but wait—the grid has (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at the top-right. So "UP" actually increases the y-coordinate.

Wait, no—wait a second. The movement directions: UP means y+1, DOWN is y-1, RIGHT x+1, LEFT x-1. So from (9,9), moving UP would take it to (9,10), which is out of bounds. That's a problem because that direction isn't valid anymore.

So the current direction is "UP", but the head is at (9,9). If we try to move "UP" again, the new head will be outside the grid, leading to death. So the snake can't continue moving "UP".

The next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. But since it's currently going UP, we can't reverse direction immediately. Wait, no—the rules say you cannot choose the opposite direction of the current one. Since current is "UP", you can't go "DOWN". So the allowed directions now are LEFT and RIGHT, but not UP or DOWN.

Wait, no—rule 2 says you can't reverse. If current is UP, next move can't be DOWN. But from (9,9), moving LEFT would take it to (8,9), which seems possible. Moving RIGHT is impossible because x=9 is the maximum.

So first, after the initial state, what can the snake do? It's at (9,9) facing UP, but moving UP isn't possible anymore because that would go out of bounds. So the only possible moves are LEFT and DOWN—but wait, can it change direction to LEFT or RIGHT?

Wait no—the current direction is "UP", so next move can't be DOWN. So allowed directions are LEFT and RIGHT.

But from (9,9), moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is max. So the only valid initial move is LEFT, but let's see if that makes sense.

So first move: LEFT to (8,9). Now, after moving LEFT, the direction changes to "LEFT". The next moves can't be "RIGHT" then, as per rule 2.

Wait, no—the new direction becomes whatever we choose. So each move is a choice of direction, but you can't choose the opposite of your previous direction unless it's NONE.

Wait, rule 2 says: cannot reverse. So if current direction is UP, next can't be DOWN; LEFT can't be RIGHT, etc.

So initial direction is "UP". After first move, say we choose LEFT (from UP). Now, direction is LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, no—the new direction would be whatever is chosen in each step. So after moving LEFT from UP, the current direction becomes LEFT, and the next move can't be RIGHT.

But let's plan step by step.

Current head: (9,9), body is [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7)].

First move options are LEFT or DOWN? Wait no—current direction is UP. So next move can't be DOWN. So allowed directions are LEFT and RIGHT.

But from (9,9), moving RIGHT would take x to 10, which is invalid. So only possible initial move is LEFT to (8,9).

After moving LEFT, the new head is (8,9). The body shifts: the old head (9,9) becomes the first body cell. Then, since we moved and didn't eat an apple, the tail moves as well.

So body cells become [(8,9), (9,8), (9,7)]. Wait no—the initial body is [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7)], so when moving LEFT:

- New head: (8,9)
- Insert old head at front of body: new body starts with (9,9) then the rest. But wait, after movement:

The full process is:
1. Compute new_head based on direction.
2. Check for collision—if okay, proceed.
3. Update body by adding new_head's previous position to the front, then remove tail unless eating apple.

In this case, since we didn't eat the apple (apple is at (7,6)), the body would insert (9,9) at front and remove last element (8,7). So body becomes [(9,9), (9,8), (9,7)].

Wait no—the initial body is [B1=(9,8), B2=(9,7), tail=(8,7)]. After moving LEFT:

- Insert old head (9,9) at front: new body starts as [9,9], then the rest.
- Then remove last element because not eating apple. So new body after inserting is [(9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]? Wait no—the initial body list in input is [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7)], which are B1, B2, tail.

So when moving, we insert the old head (9,9) at front of BODY, making it [ (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]? Or wait, no—the body is a list from B1 to tail. So when inserting the old head, which was (9,9), it becomes the new B1.

Wait no—after moving, the new HEAD is (8,9). The body is updated by adding the previous HEAD to the front of BODY. Then, if not eating apple, remove the tail.

So in this case:

BODY before move: [B1=(9,8), B2=(9,7), B3=(8,7)].

After inserting old_head (9,9) at front: new body is [ (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ].

Then remove tail (8,7). So final body after move is [(9,9), (9,8), (9,7)].

So the snake's path now is HEAD at (8,9), followed by (9,9), (9,8), (9,7).

Wait that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should model each step carefully.

Let me try to simulate the first move:

Initial state:
HEAD: (9,9)
BODY: [B1=(9,8), B2=(9,7), tail=(8,7)]

Direction is "UP". So initial movement options are LEFT and RIGHT only, because can't go DOWN.

First move: LEFT → new_head = (8,9).

Check collision:

- Is (8,9) inside grid? Yes.
- Check if it's in the body except for tail. Before move, body is [B1=(9,8), B2=(9,7), tail=(8,7)].

So new_head (8,9) is not in any of these positions. So safe.

Proceed to update:

Insert old head (9,9) at front of BODY: new body becomes [ (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ].

Since apple is not eaten (new_head ≠ (7,6)), remove tail (8,7). So final body after move is [ (9,9), (9,8), (9,7) ].

So the new state after first move:

HEAD: (8,9)
BODY: [B1=(9,9), B2=(9,8), B3=(9,7)]
Direction: "LEFT"

Next moves need to plan towards (7,6).

From here, we can choose directions. Current direction is LEFT, so next can't be RIGHT.

So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.

But from (8,9):

- Moving UP would take y+1 → (8,10): invalid.
- So options: DOWN or LEFT.

Wait, no—current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. But the other options are UP, DOWN, and LEFT. Wait no—rule 2 says you cannot reverse, which for current direction LEFT, next can't choose RIGHT. So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.

But from (8,9):

- Moving UP: y=10 invalid.
- So possible moves are DOWN or LEFT.

Wait, but moving DOWN from (8,9) would go to (8,8), which is a body cell [(9,9), (9,8), (9,7)]—so new_head (8,8) would be safe because it's not in the current BODY except for tail?

Wait no—after first move, the body is [B1=(9,9), B2=(9,8), B3=(9,7)]. So moving DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8):

- Is (8,8) in the body? The body after first move is [(9,9), (9,8), (9,7)]. So no.

So safe. Let's try that.

Move 2: DOWN → (8,8).

Check collision:

- Inside grid.
- new_head = (8,8). Current body after first move is [ (9,9), (9,8), (9,7) ].

(8,8) not in any of these. So safe.

Proceed to update:

Insert old head (8,9) at front of BODY: new body becomes [ (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (9,7) ].

Since apple not eaten, remove tail (9,7). Final body: [ (8,9), (9,9), (9,8) ].

New state:

HEAD: (8,8)
BODY: [B1=(8,9), B2=(9,9), B3=(9,8)]
Direction: DOWN

Next move. Current direction is DOWN, so next can't be UP.

Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

From (8,8):

- Moving LEFT: x=7 → (7,8). Is this safe?
Check body: [B1=(8,9), B2=(9,9), B3=(9,8)].

(7,8) not in these. So safe.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,8), but that's a body cell now (after inserting old_head). Wait, after first two moves:

Wait after move 2, the head is at (8,8), and the body is [B1=(8,9), B2=(9,9), B3=(9,8)]. So moving RIGHT would take head to (9,8), which is B3. That's not allowed because new_head can't be in the body except for tail.

Wait no—after move 2, before any next moves, the body is [B1=(8,9), B2=(9,9), B3=(9,8)].

So moving RIGHT from (8,8) → (9,8). Is that in the body?

Yes. So collision occurs because new_head would be at (9,8), which is a body cell except for tail? Or wait, after move 2:

The body is [(8,9), (9,9), (9,8)]. Tail is (9,8).

So when moving RIGHT, new_head is (9,8), which is the current tail. So collision?

No—the rule says that new_head can't be in the body except for the tail? Or not.

Wait the rules say: new head must not collide with any part of the body except for the case where it's a snake that just ate food.

In this case, since we didn't eat apple, so new_head can't be on any body cell.

So moving to (9,8) is in the body (it's B3). So collision occurs; move invalid.

Thus, from (8,8), possible moves are LEFT and DOWN and RIGHT only if safe. But RIGHT leads to body cell, so not allowed.

Move 3 options: LEFT or DOWN.

Option 1: Move LEFT to (7,8).

Check collision:

- new_head = (7,8). Current body after move 2 is [B1=(8,9), B2=(9,9), B3=(9,8)]. So no collision. Safe.

Proceed to update:

Insert old head (8,8) at front of BODY: becomes [(8,8), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8)].

Remove tail because not eating apple: new body is [ (8,8), (8,9), (9,9) ].

So state after move 3:

HEAD: (7,8)
BODY: [(8,8), (8,9), (9,9)]
Direction: LEFT

Next move. Current direction is LEFT, so next can't be RIGHT.

Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.

From (7,8):

- Moving LEFT → (6,8). Safe? Check body [B1=(8,8), B2=(8,9), B3=(9,9)].

(6,8) not in body. So safe.

Option 2: Move DOWN to (7,7).

Check if (7,7) is in body: no. Also inside grid.

So possible moves: LEFT or DOWN.

But let's see the path towards apple at (7,6). The target is x=7, y=6.

From current HEAD (7,8), moving down would reach closer to the target.

Let me consider that.

Move 4: DOWN from (7,8) → (7,7).

Check collision:

- new_head = (7,7). Current body [B1=(8,8), B2=(8,9), B3=(9,9)].

No collision. Safe.

Proceed to update:

Insert old head (7,8) at front: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (9,9)].

Remove tail because no apple eaten: new body is [ (7,8), (8,8), (8,9) ].

So state after move 4:

HEAD: (7,7)
BODY: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9)]
Direction: DOWN

Next move. Current direction is DOWN, so can't go UP.

Possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

From (7,7):

- Moving LEFT → (6,7). Check body [B1=(7,8), B2=(8,8), B3=(8,9)]—no collision.
- Moving RIGHT → (8,7). Current body has no cell at (8,7) except maybe past moves? Wait after move 4, the body is [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9)]. So moving to (8,7) would be new_head. Check if in body: no.

But from (7,7), moving RIGHT to (8,7). Is that safe?

Yes, because (8,7) isn't in the current body.

So possible moves are LEFT and RIGHT.

Let me think about the target position at (7,6). To reach it, the snake needs to go down again or move left/right.

But moving further DOWN from (7,7) would take y=6, which is closer. Alternatively, moving right might allow for a path.

Wait, but the apple is at (7,6), so maybe best to go straight down.

Move 5: DOWN → (7,6). That's exactly where the apple is!

So let's try that.

Compute new_head = (7,6).

Check collision:

- Inside grid.
- Check body before this move: [B1=(7,8), B2=(8,8), B3=(8,9)].

new_head (7,6) not in any of these. So safe.

Since new_head is at apple position, we don't remove the tail; instead, we add a new segment.

So update:

Insert old head (7,7) at front: [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)].

Because it ate the apple, the body doesn't lose a segment. So body becomes [B1=(7,7), B2=(7,8), B3=(8,8), B4=(8,9)].

So state after move 5:

HEAD: (7,6)
BODY: [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)]
Direction: DOWN
Apple eaten! Now the snake is longer.

Now, from here, next moves can be planned to navigate away or continue. But perhaps this is the optimal path.

But let's see if it works.

Wait, but after moving DOWN to (7,6), which is where the apple was. So the snake has successfully eaten the apple and grown by one segment.

Now, what's next? The snake can choose any direction except UP, because previous direction was DOWN.

So possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

From (7,6):

- Moving LEFT → (6,6)
- Moving RIGHT → (8,6)
- Moving DOWN → (7,5)

Let me think where to go next. The snake is at (7,6), and the apple has been eaten. Perhaps it needs to move away or continue towards somewhere.

But the problem didn't specify what happens after eating; perhaps just to have a path that reaches the apple.

So in this case, the initial moves have reached the apple in 5 steps:

1. LEFT
2. DOWN
3. LEFT
4. DOWN
5. DOWN

Wait no—let's recount:

Move 1: LEFT → (8,9)
Move 2: DOWN → (8,8)
Move 3: LEFT → (7,8)
Move 4: DOWN → (7,7)
Move 5: DOWN → (7,6) [eaten apple]

So that's five moves to reach the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps a shorter path exists. Let me think again.

Is there a way to reach (7,6) in fewer steps?

Alternative approach:

After initial state, move LEFT twice instead of once.

Wait from initial position (9,9), can't move DOWN because current direction is UP; but after first move, let's try moving differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake should go LEFT then DOWN multiple times to reach x=7 and y=6.

But maybe the initial path I took was efficient.

So overall, the minimal number of moves required would be 5: LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN.

Thus, the solution is to move in that sequence.
</think>

The snake can successfully eat the apple by moving in the following directions:

1. Left
2. Down
3. Left
4. Down
5. Down

This sequence navigates the snake from (9,9) to (7,6), eating the apple in five moves.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake's head is at (9,9). The body follows as [B1=(9,8), B2=(9,7), ...].
   
   - **Move 1: Left → (8,9)**
     - New position: Head at (8,9).
     - Body updates to [(8,9), (9,9), (9,8)].

2. **Move 2: Down → (8,8)**
   - Avoids collision; new head at (8,8).
   - Body becomes [(8,8), (8,9), (9,9)].

3. **Move 3: Left → (7,8)**
   - Safe move; head moves to (7,8).
   - Body updates to [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9)].

4. **Move 4: Down → (7,7)**
   - Moves closer to the apple at y=6.
   - Head is now at (7,7).
   - Body becomes [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8)].

5. **Move 5: Down → (7,6)**
   - Reaches and eats the apple, growing longer.
   - New head position (7,6) with body segments appended.

**Answer:** The snake should move Left, Down, Left, Down, and Down to eat the apple. 

The directions are: LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN.

So, the final sequence is \boxed{←, ↓, ←, ↓, ↓}
