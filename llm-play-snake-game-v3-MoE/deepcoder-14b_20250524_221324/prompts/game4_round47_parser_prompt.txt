You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

Alright, let's break down how I approached solving this problem step by step.

First, I needed to understand the game state provided. The snake's head is at (3,7), and it's currently moving downward. The body segments are behind the head: [(3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9)]. This means the snake is extending from its head downwards towards the top-right of the grid.

The apple is located at (0,7). My initial thought was to figure out a path that allows the snake's head to move leftward since the x-coordinate needs to decrease from 3 to 0. The y-coordinate remains the same, so no need for vertical movement.

I considered the possible directions the snake can take without causing immediate collisions. Since the current direction is "DOWN," I couldn't reverse it by moving "UP" next. So, the options were "LEFT," "RIGHT," or staying in a non-reversing state if allowed.

Looking at the body segments, I noticed that if the snake moves left from (3,7), it might interfere with its own body segments as they shift. The segment behind the head is at (3,8), which is directly above. Moving left would take the head to (2,7). Then, each subsequent body part would shift: the head becomes (2,7), and the body parts move forward. I had to ensure that after each move, the new head position doesn't collide with any existing body segments except possibly the tail if it's about to move.

I also considered whether moving left initially would block any future paths or trap the snake. Since the apple is on the opposite side of the grid, a direct path without obstacles seemed feasible. I calculated that moving left three times would bring the head to (0,7) in three moves, but I had to account for the body shifting each time.

Another consideration was whether eating the apple would cause the snake's body to grow and if that might block any necessary future movements. However, since the path is straightforward and doesn't require complex detours, it seemed manageable.

I also verified the movement rules regarding direction changes and collision checks to ensure compliance. Each move needed to be validated for grid boundaries and body segment collisions before executing.

Finally, I concluded that moving left three times would safely navigate the snake's head to the apple without causing any immediate or future collisions, ensuring the path is both safe and efficient.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake can safely move directly left towards the apple at (0,7) as there are no immediate obstacles. Each LEFT move will shift the head closer to the target without colliding with its body or grid boundaries."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)], to eat the apple at (0, 7).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
