{"moves": ["UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"], "reasoning": "To avoid self-collision, we need to ensure that each move extends the snake's head in a direction without overlapping its body segments. Starting from (9,1), moving upwards twice brings the snake to (9,3). From there, moving left repeatedly until reaching x=4 and then moving up once more will lead us to the target. This method ensures efficiency and correctness by adhering to grid movement rules and avoiding overlaps with the snake's body segments."}
