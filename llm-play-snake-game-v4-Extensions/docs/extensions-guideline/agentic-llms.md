# Agentic LLMs for Snake Game AI

> **Important — Authoritative Reference:** This document supplements the _Final Decision Series_ (`final-decision-0` → `final-decision-10`) and follows the established architectural patterns.

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy: LLM-Powered Autonomous Agents**

Agentic LLMs represent the next evolution of AI systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously in complex environments. In the Snake Game AI context, these agents leverage large language models not just for decision-making, but for sophisticated reasoning, planning, and learning.

### **Design Philosophy**
- **Autonomous Reasoning**: LLMs that can analyze game states and develop strategies
- **Multi-Step Planning**: Agents that plan ahead rather than just react
- **Self-Reflection**: Ability to analyze and improve performance over time
- **Tool Integration**: Combining LLM reasoning with external tools and APIs

## 🧠 **Agentic Architecture Components**

### **Core Agent Types**

#### **ReAct Agent (Reasoning + Acting)**
- Alternates between reasoning about the game state and taking actions
- Uses structured prompts to think through decisions step-by-step
- Maintains internal dialogue for decision justification

#### **Chain-of-Thought Agent**
- Breaks down complex game scenarios into logical reasoning steps
- Explicitly shows reasoning process for educational value
- Enables debugging and improvement of decision-making

#### **Tool-Using Agent**
- Can call external APIs for pathfinding, analysis, or game state evaluation
- Integrates with heuristic algorithms when needed
- Uses tools to augment LLM capabilities

#### **Memory-Enhanced Agent**
- Maintains persistent memory of past games and strategies
- Learns from successful patterns across multiple games
- Adapts strategy based on historical performance

## 🔧 **Implementation Patterns**

### **ReAct Agent Implementation**
```python
class ReActAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Agent for Snake Game
    
    Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
    - Alternates between reasoning and acting phases
    - Uses structured prompts for explicit reasoning
    - Maintains decision history for learning
    
    Educational Value:
    Demonstrates how LLMs can be structured to think before acting,
    making their decision process transparent and debuggable.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, grid_size: int):
        super().__init__(name, grid_size)
        self.reasoning_history = []
        self.decision_history = []
    
    def plan_move(self, game_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Plan move using ReAct reasoning pattern"""
        # Observation
        observation = self._format_observation(game_state)
        
        # Thought (Reasoning)
        thought = self._generate_thought(observation)
        self.reasoning_history.append(thought)
        
        # Action
        action = self._decide_action(thought, observation)
        self.decision_history.append({
            'observation': observation,
            'thought': thought,
            'action': action

    - Can call pathfinding, analysis, or other utilities
    - Combines symbolic AI with neural approaches

        needs_pathfinding = self._assess_pathfinding_need(game_state)
        
        if needs_pathfinding:
            path = self.tools['pathfinder'].find_optimal_path(game_state)
            context = f"Optimal path found: {path}"
        else:
            context = "No pathfinding needed"
        
        # Make decision with tool context
        return self._generate_move_with_context(game_state, context)
