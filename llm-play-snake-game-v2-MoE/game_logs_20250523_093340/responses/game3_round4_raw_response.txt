========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is currently at (8,5) facing RIGHT, and the apple is at (1,1). The body is at (7,5). My goal is to find a path that leads the head to the apple without colliding with the body or the walls, and also ensuring that after eating the apple, there's still a valid move.

First, let's consider the movement constraints. The snake can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. So the first move can't be LEFT. Also, I need to avoid moving into the body. The body is at (7,5), which is directly to the left of the head (8,5). So if the snake moves LEFT, it would crash into the body. Therefore, the first move can't be LEFT either. Wait, but the current direction is RIGHT, so reversing would be LEFT, which is prohibited. So the first move can't be LEFT. Also, moving LEFT would take the head to (7,5), which is the body's position. So that's a collision. So the first move options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But moving RIGHT would take the head to (9,5), which is on the edge of the grid. Then, the next move would need to consider that. However, the apple is at (1,1), which is far to the left and down. So moving RIGHT might not be the best initial move. Let's think about the direction that takes the snake towards the apple.

The apple is at (1,1). The head is at (8,5). So, the x-coordinate needs to decrease by 7 (from 8 to 1), and the y-coordinate needs to decrease by 4 (from 5 to 1). So the snake needs to move left multiple times and down multiple times. However, since the initial direction is RIGHT, the first move can't be LEFT. So maybe start by moving DOWN first.

Let me map out possible steps. Let's think of a path that moves the snake left and down, avoiding the body and walls.

Starting at (8,5), direction RIGHT. First move can't be LEFT. Let's try moving DOWN first. From (8,5), moving DOWN would take the head to (8,4). Then, the body is now [(8,5), (7,5)]. Wait, the body is updated each step. Wait, the initial body is [(7,5)], so when the head moves, the body shifts. Let me think about how the body moves.

Initially, the head is at (8,5), body is [(7,5)]. If the snake moves DOWN, the new head is (8,4). The body then becomes [(8,5), (7,5)], but since the apple isn't eaten, the tail is removed. Wait, the movement rules say that when the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. So when the snake moves, the body shifts. So in the first move, after moving, the body would be [(8,5)], because the original body was [(7,5)], and the head moves to (8,4), then the body is updated by adding the previous head position (8,5) and removing the tail (which was (7,5) before the move). Wait, maybe I need to think about the movement step by step.

Original position: Head (8,5), body [(7,5)]. So the body is one segment behind the head. When moving, the new head is calculated, then the body is updated. So for example, if the snake moves DOWN to (8,4), the new body would be [(8,5)] because the previous head (8,5) becomes part of the body, and the old body (7,5) is removed. Wait, but the body is a list of positions excluding the head. So the original body is [(7,5)], which is the segment behind the head. When the head moves, the body is updated by adding the previous head position and removing the last body segment. But since the snake isn't eating an apple, the tail is removed. So after moving, the body would be [(8,5)], because the head moves to (8,4), and the body becomes the previous head (8,5) and the old body (7,5) is removed. Wait, no. The body is a list of segments excluding the head. So the original body is [(7,5)], which is the segment behind the head. When the head moves, the new body is the previous head position added to the list, and the last element (the tail) is removed. So if the snake moves, the body becomes [(8,5)] (the previous head), and the tail (7,5) is removed. So after moving, the body is [(8,5)].

So, moving DOWN first would take the head to (8,4), and the body becomes [(8,5)]. Then, the next move can be LEFT, but need to check for collisions. Let's try that.

So first move: DOWN → (8,4). Now body is [(8,5)]. Then, next move can be LEFT. Moving LEFT would take the head to (7,4). Check if that's safe. The body is [(8,5)], which is not in (7,4), so that's safe. Then, from (7,4), maybe move LEFT again to (6,4), and so on towards the left. But need to make sure that the path doesn't hit the body or walls.

But also, the apple is at (1,1), so the snake needs to move down as well. So after moving left several times, the snake would need to move down. However, the initial steps need to avoid the body.

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT first isn't possible because of the initial body. But since the first move can't be LEFT (due to direction being RIGHT), but moving DOWN is allowed.

Another approach: since the apple is far to the left and down, the snake needs to move left and down. But the initial position is at (8,5), and the body is at (7,5). So moving left would take the head to (7,5), which is the body's position. That's a collision. So the first move can't be LEFT. So the first move has to be either UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But moving RIGHT would take the head to (9,5), which is on the edge of the grid. Then, the next move can't be LEFT (since the current direction is RIGHT). So moving right might not be helpful. Moving UP would take the head to (8,6), which is within the grid, but then the snake would need to move left and down. Let's consider that.

If first move is UP: head moves to (8,6), body becomes [(8,5)]. Then, next move can be LEFT (since current direction is UP, so can't move DOWN). Moving LEFT would take the head to (7,6), which is safe. Then, continue moving left towards the apple. But this path might take longer, but it's possible.

Alternatively, moving DOWN first. Let's try that path again.

First move: DOWN → (8,4), body becomes [(8,5)]. Next move can be LEFT (since direction is DOWN, can't move UP). Moving LEFT to (7,4). Then, body becomes [(8,4), (8,5)]. Wait, no. Wait, when the head moves, the body is updated. So after moving DOWN to (8,4), the body is [(8,5)]. Then, moving LEFT to (7,4), the new head is (7,4), and the body becomes [(8,4)]. Because the previous head (8,4) is added to the body, and the tail (8,5) is removed? No, the body is the list of segments excluding the head. So when the head moves from (8,4) to (7,4), the new body is [(8,4)], because the previous head (8,4) becomes part of the body. The original body was [(8,5)], so after moving, the body becomes [(8,4)].

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The body is the list of segments excluding the head. So the initial body is [(7,5)], which is one segment. When the head moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed (unless the apple is eaten). So for example, when the head moves from (8,5) to (8,4), the new body is [(8,5)], because the previous head (8,5) becomes part of the body, and the original body (7,5) is removed. So after moving, the body is [(8,5)].

Then, moving LEFT to (7,4), the new head is (7,4), and the body becomes [(8,4)]. So the body is now [(8,4)]. So in that case, the body is only one segment, and it's at (8,4). So when the head is at (7,4), the body is at (8,4). So that's safe.

Continuing this path, the snake can move left multiple times, each time the body shifts. For example, moving left from (7,4) to (6,4), body becomes [(7,4)]. Then, (5,4) → body [(6,4)], etc. So as the snake moves left, the body follows. However, the apple is at (1,1), so the snake needs to also move down.

Once the snake reaches the left side of the grid, it can start moving down. Let's outline a possible path:

1. DOWN → (8,4)
2. LEFT → (7,4)
3. LEFT → (6,4)
4. LEFT → (5,4)
5. LEFT → (4,4)
6. LEFT → (3,4)
7. LEFT → (2,4)
8. LEFT → (1,4)
9. DOWN → (1,3)
10. DOWN → (1,2)
11. DOWN → (1,1) → eats apple

But need to check for collisions. Let's simulate each step.

Step 1: Head at (8,5) moves DOWN to (8,4). Body is [(8,5)]. Safe.

Step 2: Head at (8,4) moves LEFT to (7,4). Body is [(8,4)]. Safe.

Step 3: Head at (7,4) moves LEFT to (6,4). Body is [(7,4)]. Safe.

Step 4: Head at (6,4) moves LEFT to (5,4). Body is [(6,4)]. Safe.

Step 5: Head at (5,4) moves LEFT to (4,4). Body is [(5,4)]. Safe.

Step 6: Head at (4,4) moves LEFT to (3,4). Body is [(4,4)]. Safe.

Step 7: Head at (3,4) moves LEFT to (2,4). Body is [(3,4)]. Safe.

Step 8: Head at (2,4) moves LEFT to (1,4). Body is [(2,4)]. Safe.

Now, the head is at (1,4). Next, need to move down to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).

Step 9: DOWN to (1,3). Body is [(1,4)]. Safe.

Step 10: DOWN to (1,2). Body is [(1,3)]. Safe.

Step 11: DOWN to (1,1). Eats apple. Now, the body is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)], and the snake has grown. After eating the apple, the tail is not removed. So the body becomes [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,4)]? Wait, no. When the snake eats the apple, the tail is not removed. So after moving to (1,1), the body is the previous body plus the previous head. So before eating, the body was [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]? Wait, let's think again.

After step 8, the head is at (1,4), body is [(2,4)]. Then step 9: move down to (1,3). The body becomes [(1,4)]. Step 10: move down to (1,2), body becomes [(1,3)]. Step 11: move down to (1,1). Now, the apple is eaten. So the body is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)], and the tail is not removed. So the new body is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,1)]? No, the movement rules say that when the apple is eaten, the tail remains. So the body is updated by adding the previous head position (1,1) to the body, but the tail is not removed. Wait, the movement process is:

New head = head + direction.

Head becomes body segment.

Tail is removed unless apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains).

So when the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed. So in this case, when the snake moves to (1,1), which is the apple's position, the body is updated by adding the previous head (1,1) to the body, but the tail is not removed. Wait, the body is the list of segments excluding the head. So before moving, the body is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]? No, let me retrace.

After step 8: head is (1,4), body is [(2,4)].

Step 9: move down to (1,3). New head is (1,3). Body becomes [(1,4)] (previous head is added, tail is removed). Because the apple hasn't been eaten yet.

Step 10: move down to (1,2). Body becomes [(1,3)].

Step 11: move down to (1,1). Now, the apple is eaten. So the body is [(1,2), (1,3)] (previous body) plus the previous head (1,1)? Wait, the movement process is:

When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. So when the snake eats the apple, the tail is not removed. So in this case, the previous body was [(1,3)], and the head is moving from (1,2) to (1,1). Wait, no, step 11 is moving from (1,2) to (1,1). So before step 11, the head is at (1,2), body is [(1,3)]. Moving down to (1,1) (apple). Now, the new head is (1,1), and the body becomes [(1,2), (1,3)], since the tail is not removed (apple eaten). So the body is [(1,2), (1,3)]. So after eating, the body has two segments. Now, the snake's head is at (1,1), and the body is [(1,2), (1,3)]. So the next move must be such that the snake doesn't collide with its body.

After eating the apple, the snake can move in any direction except into the body. So if the next move is up (to (1,0)), but that's outside the grid. Or right (to (2,1)), which is safe. So the path is valid.

Therefore, this path is possible. The moves would be: DOWN, LEFT x7, DOWN x3.

But let's count the steps:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. LEFT
6. LEFT
7. LEFT
8. LEFT
9. DOWN
10. DOWN
11. DOWN

That's 11 moves. But the problem is to find a valid path, not necessarily the shortest. However, the question didn't specify to find the shortest path, just to provide a valid one.

Another thing to check: when moving left seven times, the head moves from (8,4) to (1,4). That's 7 moves to the left. Let's confirm:

From (8,4) to (7,4): 1

(7,4) to (6,4): 2

(6,4) to (5,4): 3

(5,4) to (4,4): 4

(4,4) to (3,4):5

(3,4) to (2,4):6

(2,4) to (1,4):7. Yes, that's 7 steps.

Then, three steps down to (1,1). Total 11 steps.

This path seems valid. Now, check for any collisions during the steps.

At each step, the body is only one segment, and it's behind the head. For example, after step 1, body is [(8,5)].

After step 2, body is [(8,4)].

After step 3, body is [(7,4)].

Wait, no. Let's re-examine the body after each step.

Step 1: Head moves from (8,5) to (8,4). Body becomes [(8,5)].

Step 2: Head moves from (8,4) to (7,4). Body becomes [(8,4)].

Step 3: Head moves from (7,4) to (6,4). Body becomes [(7,4)].

Step 4: Head moves from (6,4) to (5,4). Body becomes [(6,4)].

Step 5: Head moves from (5,4) to (4,4). Body becomes [(5,4)].

Step 6: Head moves from (4,4) to (3,4). Body becomes [(4,4)].

Step 7: Head moves from (3,4) to (2,4). Body becomes [(3,4)].

Step 8: Head moves from (2,4) to (1,4). Body becomes [(2,4)].

Then, step 9: move down to (1,3). Body becomes [(1,4)].

Step 10: move down to (1,2). Body becomes [(1,3)].

Step 11: move down to (1,1). Body becomes [(1,2), (1,3)] (since apple is eaten, tail is not removed).

At no point does the head collide with the body. So this path is valid.

Therefore, the sequence of moves is:

DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

Another thing to check: the initial direction is RIGHT, so the first move can be DOWN (which is allowed). Then, after moving DOWN, the direction is DOWN, so the next move can be LEFT (since the opposite direction of DOWN is UP, which is not allowed, but LEFT is allowed).

Yes, that's correct. The direction changes with each move, but the only restriction is that you can't move in the opposite direction of the previous move.

Wait, no. The problem didn't mention any restrictions on direction changes. The only restriction is that the first move can't be LEFT because of the initial direction being RIGHT. Wait, no, the initial direction is not specified. The problem says "You are given a snake in a grid...", but the initial direction is not mentioned. Wait, the user hasn't provided any specific initial direction. The user's question is to provide a valid sequence of moves for the snake to reach the apple.

Wait, perhaps the initial direction is not relevant, and the snake can choose any direction for the first move. However, in the initial scenario, the snake is at (8,5) with the body at (7,5). So the first move can't be LEFT, because that would collide with the body. But the initial direction is not specified. So perhaps the problem assumes that the snake can move in any direction as long as it doesn't collide.

But in this case, the first move is DOWN, which is allowed. So the path is valid.

Therefore, the answer is the sequence of moves: DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

But the problem might require the answer to be in a specific format, like a list of directions. However, the user hasn't specified the format. Looking back at the user's message, the initial instruction was to provide a valid sequence, but in the problem statement, perhaps the user is referring to a standard problem where the snake moves on a grid, and the answer is to provide the directions.

But since the user hasn't provided more context, the answer is the sequence of moves as outlined.
</think>

To guide the snake from its starting position at **(8,5)** (with the body at **(7,5)**) to the apple located at **(1,1)**, we can construct a valid sequence of moves that ensures the snake avoids collisions with its own body and remains within the grid boundaries.

---

### ✅ **Key Constraints**:
- The snake cannot move into its own body.
- The snake must stay within the grid bounds (assuming a 10x10 grid or similar).
- The snake cannot move in the opposite direction of its current movement unless it turns (no such restriction is imposed here, as the problem does not specify such a rule).

---

### 📌 **Strategy**:
- Move **down** to avoid the body at **(7,5)**.
- Then, move **left** repeatedly until the snake reaches the left edge of the grid.
- Finally, move **down** to reach the apple at **(1,1)**.

---

### 📋 **Step-by-Step Move Sequence**:

1. **DOWN** → (8,5) → (8,4)  
2. **LEFT** → (8,4) → (7,4)  
3. **LEFT** → (7,4) → (6,4)  
4. **LEFT** → (6,4) → (5,4)  
5. **LEFT** → (5,4) → (4,4)  
6. **LEFT** → (4,4) → (3,4)  
7. **LEFT** → (3,4) → (2,4)  
8. **LEFT** → (2,4) → (1,4)  
9. **DOWN** → (1,4) → (1,3)  
10. **DOWN** → (1,3) → (1,2)  
11. **DOWN** → (1,2) → (1,1) **(Apple Eaten)**

---

### ✅ **Validation**:
- All moves are within grid bounds.
- The body is always one step behind the head and does not block the path.
- The snake reaches the apple at **(1,1)** without any collisions.

---

### 🧾 **Final Answer**:

```plaintext
DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN
```
