  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 4 times to align with the apple's x-coordinate and then down 6 times to reach the apple's y-coordinate. This path avoids collisions with the snake's body and stays within grid bounds."
