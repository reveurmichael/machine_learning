========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to help the snake get from (5,5) to eat the apple at (2,7). Let's break it down step by step.

First, the snake is currently at (5,5) and direction is NONE. The body cells are empty except for the head since the list is []. So, no blocking in the immediate vicinity. That means I can move freely without worrying about collisions right now.

Looking at the apple position (2,7), it's to the northwest of the head. To get there, the snake needs to make 3 steps left and 2 steps up. But since movement is grid-based, each step has to be carefully planned to avoid self-collisions.

Starting move: Let's consider moving LEFT first because that's towards reducing x-coordinate by 1 each time. So, direction "LEFT".

After moving LEFT once, the new head position would be (4,5). Now, check for any possible collisions or future issues. Since there are no body cells yet, just need to ensure movement is allowed.

Next move: Again, LEFT will take us closer. New head becomes (3,5). Still on track towards (2,7).

Third move: LEFT again would get us to (2,5), which is directly below the apple's y-coordinate of 7. Now, we need to start moving UP to reach the apple.

Fourth move: UP takes us from (2,5) to (2,6). Still not at the apple yet.

Fifth move: UP again brings us to (2,7), which is exactly where the apple is located. At this point, since the snake hasn't eaten anything except maybe the apple on the last move, but we just moved into it successfully. So, that's a safe path without any collision checks failing as long as each step didn't collide.

Wait, did I miss something? Oh right, when moving into the apple position, if there are no other body cells interfering (since the body is empty except for the head which moves to the new position), it should be fine. The snake will grow by 1 because it ate the apple, so the body length increases but in this case, since the initial direction was none and we can make a move without worrying about the tail not moving.

Also, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn to avoid immediate trapping. But since each step here is safe, it should be okay.
</think>

To navigate from (5,5) safely to (2,7), we plan moves left and then up without colliding with any body cells or itself.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move LEFT three times to decrease x-coordinate from 5 to 2, then move UP twice to increase y-coordinate from 5 to 7. This avoids any self-collisions and the apple is within reach without blocking the path."
}
```
