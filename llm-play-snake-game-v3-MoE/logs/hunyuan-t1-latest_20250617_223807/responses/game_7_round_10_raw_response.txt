========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 7 times (to reach x=9) and up 4 times (to reach y=7). Starting with RIGHT moves avoids reversing direction and navigates below the body's vertical segment. After reaching (7,3), moving UP incrementally avoids the body, which is trailing behind. Finally, two RIGHT moves reach the apple. Post-apple, UP or DOWN remains safe, ensuring no immediate trap."
