You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to help the snake move from (5,5) to eat the apple at (7,8) without dying. The snake can't reverse direction immediately, and it has to avoid its own body and the grid edges.

First, the snake is currently at position (5,5), facing none, which means any direction can be chosen initially as long as it's not reversing. To reach (7,8), the head needs to move right twice and up three times in some order because the Manhattan distance requires those specific net movements.

But I have to plan a path that ensures each move doesn't lead to a collision with the body or walls. Since there are no other body parts mentioned, except for the head at (5,5), moving directly towards the apple should be safe initially.

Let me consider possible directions:

1. Right: Moving right from (5,5) would take it to (6,5). Then another right to (7,5). From there, I need to move up three times.
2. Up first might also work but could potentially require more steps or hitting walls earlier.

Wait, moving RIGHT twice and then UP three times should get the snake directly towards the apple without any immediate issues because it's moving in a straight line, avoiding obstacles (since there are none). But I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause the head to go out of bounds. Since starting at (5,5), adding right twice would be within 0-9 for both x and y.

But hold on, after eating the apple, the snake should still have a legal move afterward. So if it's placed such that the only way back is blocked, that could cause issues. But since the problem doesn't specify any body parts beyond the head, I think moving straight towards the apple is safe.

So the sequence would be RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP, UP. Each step should check for collisions:

- After each move, the new position shouldn't go out of bounds or collide with previous positions (but since there are no other body parts except the head moving forward, it's just checking if the new head is within the grid).

Let me simulate this path:

1. Move RIGHT to (6,5)
2. Move RIGHT again to (7,5)
3. Then UP to (7,6)
4. UP to (7,7)
5. UP to (7,8)

Each of these steps should be valid as long as the new head doesn't go beyond 9 for x or y.

Yes, this path seems safe and leads directly to the apple without any immediate collision risks.
</think>

The snake can safely move towards the apple by moving RIGHT twice followed by UP three times. This ensures it reaches (7,8) without reversing direction immediately or colliding with walls or its own body since there are no other segments beyond the head.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move right twice to reach x=7 and then move up three times to reach y=8. This path avoids reversing direction immediately and ensures safe movement without collision."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (7, 8).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
