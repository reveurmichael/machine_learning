<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a snake starting at position (5,5) with no body cells because the list is empty. The apple is at (8,4). I need to plan a path for the head to reach the apple without colliding with itself or going outside the grid.

First, let's understand the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction on its first move. So if it starts moving right, it can't immediately go left next turn. Also, each move involves the entire body shifting forward, except when the apple is eaten, in which case the tail stays.

The head needs to get from (5,5) to (8,4). To do this efficiently, I should think about how many steps are needed and the directions required. The difference between x positions is 3 (from 5 to 8), so it needs a net of 3 rights minus lefts. Similarly, y goes from 5 to 4, so a net of 1 down.

So, we need more right moves than left by 3 and more up moves than down by 1. That gives us some constraints on the number of each move direction.

Since the snake can't reverse immediately, if it starts moving right, next it should go either right again or up or down. Similarly for other directions. But since we need a net movement right and slightly upwards, maybe starting with right would be logical.

Now, let's plan possible moves:

1. Move RIGHT: Head goes to (6,5). Body is now at (5,5), which was the head before.
2. Next move can't be LEFT because of rule 3. So options are RIGHT again or UP or DOWN.

If we go RIGHT again, that would give us a net right movement of 2 so far. Then:

3. Move RIGHT to (7,5).
4. Next move still can't be LEFT if previous was RIGHT. So try moving RIGHT to (8,5), but then y is at 5 which needs to decrease by 1.

But wait, from (8,5) we need to go down once more. However, after eating the apple, it should have a next legal move. Wait, no—the first time it eats the apple? Or does it mean that when it's on the apple position, it shouldn't be in a position where it can't move anymore?

Wait, according to the constraints, after eating the apple, we need to ensure there's at least one legal move afterward.

So, let me try planning another path:

1. Move RIGHT to (6,5).
2. Move UP: From (6,5) to (6,4). Now y is 4, which matches where we need to go.
3. Next move can't be LEFT since previous was UP. So options are RIGHT, DOWN, or none.

But wait, the head is at (6,4), and needs to get to (8,4), so it's two more steps right. So:

3. Move RIGHT to (7,4).
4. Next move can't be LEFT if previous was RIGHT. So options are RIGHT again or DOWN/UP.

Moving RIGHT would take us to (8,4) which is the apple position.

So let's see:

1. RIGHT: (6,5)
2. UP: (6,4)
3. RIGHT: (7,4)
4. RIGHT: (8,4)

Wait, but after step 3, moving right again would be allowed since previous move was UP, not RIGHT or LEFT.

But wait, movement rules say that the snake cannot reverse direction in consecutive moves unless it's NONE. So if you were going UP and then can't go DOWN immediately, but RIGHT is fine.

So yes, moving RIGHT from (7,4) to (8,4) would be allowed because previous was UP.

But now, when we eat the apple at (8,4), do we need to make sure there's another move possible?

Because after eating, the snake body doesn't shrink. So adding 3 moves: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT? Wait no:

Wait, let me correct that. The first move is RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5). Then UP from (6,5) to (6,4). Then another RIGHT to (7,4), then another RIGHT to (8,4). So four moves in total.

But wait, the initial position after first move is:

Head at (6,5), body at (5,5).

Then second move UP: head at (6,4), body at (6,5). Wait no—when you move UP from (6,5) to (6,4), the body shifts. So previous body was [(5,5)], and after moving up, the new head is (6,4), so the body becomes [(6,5)]. But wait, that's not correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused with how the snake moves.

Let me clarify: each time you move, the head moves in the direction of the current direction. Then the entire body follows by moving one step forward in that same direction.

But when it's a grid-based movement, if two parts of the body are on the same cell, it's an invalid position because they can't overlap.

Wait no—actually, each move is just advancing the head and shifting the rest of the body. The positions should be unique to avoid overlapping.

So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe starting with RIGHT, then RIGHT again would cause a collision if I'm not careful.

Perhaps it's better to model this step by step:

Let me consider each move carefully, keeping track of the head and body positions after each move. Let's start at (5,5). The snake's body is just [(5,5)] since there are no previous segments beyond that.

1. Move RIGHT: Head becomes (6,5), body follows to [(6,5)]. Wait no—the body was only at (5,5) before the move. So after moving right, the new head is (6,5). The rest of the body shifts one step forward—wait, but if it's just a single cell, maybe it just becomes empty.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this more carefully.

In Conway's Game of Life terms, each cell can have at most one snake part. So when you move right from (5,5), the new head is (6,5). The body follows by moving in the same direction—so if it was a single cell, perhaps after moving, the body remains as the previous position.

Wait no—the movement process for snakes usually involves each segment following its predecessor. So perhaps when you move right, all segments shift one to the right.

But this is getting complex.

Alternatively, maybe I can ignore tracking the entire body and just focus on ensuring that the head path doesn't cross itself in any way that would cause a collision before or after moving into an apple position.

Wait but perhaps it's easier if we take the number of moves needed. To go from (5,5) to (8,4), you need 3 steps right and 1 step up, total of 4 steps if all are in straight lines without backtracking.

But since direction can't reverse on consecutive steps, maybe that path isn't possible unless we add some delays.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake needs to make a U-turn at some point. So moving right, then up, then left? Wait no—it can’t reverse immediately.

Wait, so starting with RIGHT is allowed. Next move cannot be LEFT if you just did RIGHT.

So after moving RIGHT once, next could do RIGHT again or anything except LEFT.

But we might need to have a net movement of 3 rights and 1 up.

Hmm.

Another approach: think about the number of moves required.

The head needs to reach (8,4). So from (5,5):

- x increases by 3
- y decreases by 1

If I can make sure that over time, there's a net movement in those directions without overlapping with itself.

Let me try planning:

Move RIGHT: (6,5)
Then UP: (6,4)
Now need to go right twice more. But after moving RIGHT to (7,4), next move could be RIGHT or something else except LEFT.

But from (7,4), the final step is needed at (8,4). So that's a fourth move—so perhaps:

1. Move RIGHT: (6,5)
2. Move UP: (6,4)
3. Move RIGHT: (7,4)
4. Move RIGHT: (8,4)

But does this cause any self-overlapping? Let me check each step.

After move 1:
Head at (6,5). Body is [(5,5), which was the previous head before moving right].

Wait no—when you move, the snake's body shifts by one cell in that direction. So for a single-cell snake, it just moves to the next cell without any other cells.

So step 1: head (6,5). Body is empty except where? Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this—it's a single-cell snake initially, so moving right would result in head at (6,5), and no body—so that's fine.

After move 2:
Head moves up from (6,5) to (6,4). Body shifts accordingly—but since it was just one cell, perhaps the snake is now occupying [(6,5)] as a single cell before moving. So after step 2, the head is at (6,4).

Wait but in reality, if you have an empty grid and only the head moves each time.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it—if it's allowed to just change direction without causing overlap because of the body not having any other cells except for moving forward. So perhaps my initial approach is okay.

But let me think about whether the path would cause overlapping:

1. Start at (5,5). Move RIGHT: now head is (6,5).
2. Move UP: from (6,5) to (6,4).
3. Now need two more moves to go right twice—maybe that's possible without crossing.

So steps 3 and 4 are both moving RIGHT:

From (7,4), next move RIGHT would take it to (8,4)—that’s the destination.

But wait—if from step 2 at (6,4), then step 3 is RIGHT: head moves from (6,4) to (7,4). Then step 4 is RIGHT again to (8,4).

Is that possible? Let's see:

No self-overlapping here because each move is only in the right direction, so all are unique.

But wait—when moving from (5,5), you can’t cross over any previous cells. So after first two steps: head at (6,4). Then step three moves to (7,4)—which hasn't been occupied before if it was a single-cell snake. Same for step four: (8,4).

So that's a possible path with no self-overlap.

But wait—the problem is when the snake has more than one cell—so in my earlier steps, I considered starting as a single-cell snake and then moving right multiple times without backtracking.

Alternatively, if it were longer, but perhaps for this problem, it can be done.

Wait another thought: since in each move, only the head moves to an adjacent square, and all previous positions are erased? Or maybe not—it depends on whether the body is just a single cell or more. Maybe I should model each step as moving forward with no prior body cells except for where the snake was before—if it's a longer snake.

But in this problem, perhaps we can ignore the specifics of how many segments there are beyond one—because otherwise, tracking that would be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe to think about it abstractly: is the target cell (8,4) reachable from (5,5), considering the movement rules where:

- You can move RIGHT, LEFT, UP, or DOWN
- Each step moves in a straight line until you need to change direction but cannot reverse.
But actually, each step must be one cell at a time.

Wait no—that's not correct. The problem says "move a segment"—so maybe the head moves to an adjacent square, and all other segments follow accordingly. So for example, if the snake is two cells long: moving RIGHT from (5,5) would take it to (6,5), then (5,5)—but that's impossible because you can't have overlapping.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this; maybe since in each move only the head moves forward and all other parts follow, but for a single cell snake—it just becomes moving freely without worrying about itself. So if it's a single cell, then the movement is unimpeded as per regular grid movement with no blockages.

But perhaps that’s not correct either because actually, in the rules of snake movement in such problems, each move causes the entire body to shift forward by one segment—so for a two-segment snake moving right: head moves from (x,y) to (x+1,y), and the second segment follows from its previous position. So if you have a 3-segment snake, it would all move in that direction.

But maybe this problem is just about having the head's path not crossing itself before reaching the apple.

In any case, let's consider moving step by step:

Option 1: Move RIGHT three times and UP once. But since we can't reverse directions immediately after a move, if you have to make turns, perhaps it would require more moves.

But actually, in each move, the direction can change as long as previous moves don't cause immediate reversal.

So let's try:

Move 1: RIGHT → (6,5)
Move 2: UP → (6,4) — allowed because we didn't just reverse.
Now need to go right two more times:
Move 3: RIGHT → (7,4)
Move 4: RIGHT → (8,4)

But in this path, after moving to (6,4), then moving right twice, that's possible.

But wait—when you move from (6,5) to (6,4), and then from there, can the next move be right? Because if you're at (6,4), which was previously unoccupied before this movement sequence. So yes—it seems allowed because none of these positions were occupied in prior moves beyond the starting point.

Wait but when moving from (5,5) to (6,5), that's just a single cell; then to move up is another direction; so each position is unique—so no self-overlapping.

So perhaps this path works. Thus, four moves: RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT.

But wait—is there any possibility of the head crossing itself? For instance:

- Starting at (5,5)
- Move right → (6,5)
- Then up → (6,4)
- Then move right again to (7,4), and then right again to (8,4).

These are all unique positions—no overlaps. So seems okay.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves would be four steps:

1. Right
2. Up
3. Right
4. Right

But wait—is there a shorter way? Because maybe moving in different directions could get us to (8,4) faster with fewer steps if we can change direction more optimally.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP first then RIGHT repeatedly—let me see:

Start at (5,5)
Move up once → (5,6)
Then right three times: (6,6), (7,6), (8,6). Hmm—that ends at (8,6) which is not our target.

Alternatively, let's try moving in a different order. Maybe first move RIGHT twice and then UP.

Start at (5,5)
Move RIGHT → (6,5)
Move RIGHT again→(7,5)
Move Up→(7,6), then right once to (8,6). Not the target.

Alternatively: Start at (5,5); go up four times would take it to (5,9)—way off. Probably not useful.

Wait another approach: Think about how many steps we need to reach from (5,5) to (8,4). Since each step is a unit in one of the four directions, straight line distance is |8-5| + |4-5|=3+1=4 units. So minimal number of moves without any constraints would be 4.

But with movement constraints where you can't reverse immediately after moving—since reversing direction would mean going back to a previous cell.

Wait no—if I move right, then up, that's okay because it's not immediate reversal; similarly, moving in different directions is allowed as long as the next step doesn't go back along the same path if doing so would require immediate reversal.

So perhaps the minimal number of steps without considering the movement constraints (other than starting at (5,5) and reaching (8,4)) would be 4. But since we don't have any obstacles or other considerations beyond that, maybe it's possible in four moves.

But wait, earlier path: moving RIGHT then UP then RIGHT twice—so that's four moves indeed taking us to (8,4).

Is this a valid movement? Let me check each step:

1. Start at (5,5)
2. Move Right → (6,5) [No problem]
3. Then move Up → (6,4) — is moving up allowed after moving right without reversing direction?
   - Since previous was RIGHT, next can be any except LEFT if it's the reverse.

Wait wait—when you moved from (5,5) to (6,5), that was a RIGHT movement. Now, at (6,5), when you move Up to (6,4)—that is allowed because moving UP isn't the reverse of RIGHT—it just changes direction without being an immediate reversal.

So yes, it's allowed. So from (6,5) to (6,4).

Then, from (6,4):

Move Right → (7,4)
Then move Right again → (8,4)

Thus, four moves total—each step is valid because we're not reversing direction immediately after a prior step.

Therefore, this path seems possible in four steps. So the minimal number of moves would be 4.

Wait but let me think once more—if each segment has to move one cell at a time without getting into positions that cause overlapping or other issues—since for longer snakes you can have multiple parts moving and potentially collide. But if it's just a single segment, then no issues arise from self-overlaps as long as the head isn't on top of any previous cells.

Wait in this problem, is the snake a single cell? If so, then each move only changes the head to an adjacent square without needing to move other segments—so that would imply it's moving like a regular piece in Chess. So I think that's the case here, as otherwise the problem becomes much more complicated.

Therefore, with this assumption, yes, four moves are sufficient and necessary because the minimal distance is 4 steps: 3 rights and 1 up, but arranged optimally to avoid immediate reversals.

Wait wait—the order can be optimized. For example:

Start at (5,5)
Move Up → (5,6) — then move Right three times to reach (8,6). But that ends at a different cell—so not our target.

Alternatively:
Start at (5,5); Move Right once: (6,5), then Up once: (6,4), then Right twice: (7,4) and (8,4)—that's four moves.

Another possible path is moving in a different order:

(5,5) → RIGHT to (6,5)
→ Then RIGHT again? Wait no—if you move right from (6,5) it would go to (7,5), then maybe up once: (7,6). That may not help reach (8,4).

Wait perhaps another approach:

Moving Right twice first. Let's see:
Start at (5,5)
Move RIGHT → (6,5)
Move RIGHT again → (7,5)
Move UP three times would take it to (7, 2)—that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively: from (7,5), moving up once gives (7,6); then right once is not possible because that's only one step—doesn’t get us closer. Alternatively, maybe moving Up thrice would take it from (7,5) to (7,8), but target y-coordinate is 4—it’s higher.

Wait no, the starting point was x=5 and we need to reach x=8 which is +3; starting y=5, needing to reach y=4 which is -1. So net displacement requires moving right three times and up once (or down one time) in some order.

Thus, the minimal number of steps should be 3+1 =4 steps.

Now arrange these four moves such that no two consecutive moves are reverses—meaning you can't move LEFT after RIGHT or vice versa. So possible sequences:

For example: Right → Up → Right → Right

That's four steps as discussed earlier, and it ends at (8,4).

Another sequence could be Up then Right three times.

(5,5) → Up → (5,6); then Right thrice: (6,6), (7,6), (8,6). That ends up at x=8,y=6. Not our target.

So that doesn't work because the y-coordinate went past 4 and didn't come back.

Alternatively:

Right three times first → from (5,5) to (8,5); then Down once: move from (8,5) to (8,4). But is moving down allowed after right movements without violating any movement rules?

Wait at each step, you can't reverse direction. So for instance, starting with Right:

(5,5) → Right to (6,5): okay.

Then another Right: (7,5).

Another Right: (8,5). At this point, from (8,5), moving down is allowed as long as it's not a reverse of the previous move. Previous was RIGHT; moving DOWN isn't a reverse so that should be fine. So from (8,5) → (8,4)—that's four steps in total.

Thus, another possible sequence: Right three times then Down once—total four moves.

So two different paths each taking four steps:

1. Right → Up → Right → Right
2. Right ×3 → Down

Both reach the target in four steps without any immediate reverses.

Is it possible to do it in fewer than four steps? Let's think: minimal number of moves should be equal to Manhattan distance, which is 4—so no, it can't be done faster than that because each move contributes either towards x or y direction. So four seems the minimum.

Therefore, I think the answer is four moves.
</think>

The optimal path involves moving right twice and then up once, followed by another right movement to reach (8,4) in four steps without reversing immediately after any move.

$\boxed{4}$
