========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": [],
"reasoning": "The snake's head is at (7,0) and the apple is at (2,0), requiring a leftward path. However, the snake's body blocks the direct route along y=0 (cells (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0) are part of the body). Moving left immediately collides with the body. Other directions (UP, RIGHT) do not lead to a safe path around the body due to blocking segments and eventual collision with the body when attempting to navigate left. No valid sequence of moves avoids collisions and reaches the apple."
