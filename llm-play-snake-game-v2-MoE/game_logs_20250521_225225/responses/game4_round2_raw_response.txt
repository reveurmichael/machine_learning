========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (6,5) to eat the apple at (5,6). The head is currently at (6,5), and it's moving right. But wait, according to the initial problem statement, the current direction is RIGHT. Hmm, but let me double-check: the given position of the head is (6,5), direction is RIGHT, body cells are empty, and apple is at (5,6). 

First off, I need to calculate how many steps in each direction are required. The head needs to move left once to get from x=6 to x=5, which would require one LEFT move. Similarly, it needs to go up once from y=5 to y=6, so one UP move. So overall, the net movement is 1 LEFT and 1 UP.

But wait, the snake can't reverse direction immediately if it's moving right because that would be a U-turn, which isn't allowed on the first move. But since the head is currently at (6,5) moving right, after one move, it'll be at (7,5). From there, it can start moving up and left.

I should plan a path where the snake moves in such a way that it doesn't hit its own body or go out of bounds. The apple is at (5,6), which is two units away diagonally but only one unit to the left and one up from the current head position.

Let me sketch this out:

1. Current head: (6,5). Direction: RIGHT.
2. After moving RIGHT once more, it'll be at (7,5).
3. Now, direction can't be LEFT yet because we just moved RIGHT, but after another move, it's allowed. So from (7,5), the next move could be UP to (7,6), then LEFT twice: first to (6,6), then to (5,6). 

Wait, does that make sense? Let me see:

- Move 1: RIGHT → (7,5)
- Move 2: UP → (7,6)
- Move 3: LEFT → (6,6)
- Move 4: LEFT → (5,6)

But wait, each move after moving RIGHT can't be LEFT immediately. So from (7,5), moving UP is allowed because it's not a reverse direction.

Alternatively, maybe another path is possible:

From (7,5):

1. Move UP to (7,6)
2. Then move LEFT twice: first to (6,6), then to (5,6). That works and doesn't involve reversing immediately after RIGHT.

Another thing to consider is that when the snake eats the apple, it grows by one segment. So after eating, the tail remains if there's no more movement towards the apple. But in this case, since we need only four moves (RIGHT, UP, LEFT, LEFT), the tail won't grow until maybe the last move.

I also need to make sure that each step doesn't cause the snake to collide with its own body. Since the initial body is empty, as long as I don't create a loop before reaching the apple, it should be fine.

So putting it all together:

- First move: RIGHT → (7,5)
- Second move: UP → (7,6)
- Third move: LEFT → (6,6)
- Fourth move: LEFT → (5,6)

This path seems safe. Let me check each step for collision:

1. After first move to (7,5): No body yet, so no collision.
2. Second move to (7,6): Still free.
3. Third move to (6,6): Free as well.
4. Fourth move to (5,6): That's the apple position.

Yes, this path works without any immediate collisions or reversals after RIGHT. Also, when moving from (7,5) to (7,6), it's allowed because that's not a reversal direction since the current direction was RIGHT and now it's changing to UP.

{"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT"], "reasoning": "The snake moves right once more to avoid reversing immediately. Then, it turns up and moves left twice to reach the apple without colliding with its body or walls."}
