## Part 1: Advanced RAG Techniques (20 minutes)

The basic RAG system you built in Part 1 used vector search to retrieve relevant documents. While this approach works well for many queries, it has limitations. In this section, we'll implement three advanced techniques that significantly improve retrieval quality and accuracy.

### Why Basic RAG Isn't Always Enough

Your basic RAG system from Part 1 has several limitations:
- Vector search sometimes misses exact keyword matches
- All retrieved documents are treated equally, regardless of relevance
- Complex queries with multiple parts aren't handled effectively

Let's address these limitations one by one with advanced techniques.

### Hybrid Search: Combining Semantic and Keyword Search

Hybrid search combines two complementary approaches:
- **Semantic (vector) search**: Good at understanding conceptual meaning
- **Keyword (BM25) search**: Excellent at exact term matching

Here's how to implement it:

```python
from langchain.retrievers import BM25Retriever, EnsembleRetriever

def create_hybrid_retriever(vectordb, documents, search_kwargs={"k": 4}):
    """
    Create a hybrid retriever that combines vector search with BM25 keyword search.
    
    Args:
        vectordb: Vector database containing document embeddings
        documents: Original document chunks for BM25 indexing
        search_kwargs: Parameters for search (k = number of documents to retrieve)
        
    Returns:
        EnsembleRetriever: Combined retriever that uses both methods
    """
    # Vector retriever - good at understanding semantic meaning
    vector_retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(search_kwargs=search_kwargs)
    
    # BM25 (keyword) retriever - good at exact term matching
    bm25_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(documents)
    bm25_retriever.k = search_kwargs["k"]
    
    # Combine retrievers with different weights
    ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
        retrievers=[bm25_retriever, vector_retriever],
        weights=[0.3, 0.7]  # 30% weight to keyword search, 70% to semantic search
    )
    
    return ensemble_retriever
```

#### How Hybrid Search Improves Results

Let's take a practical example. Imagine we're searching for "transformers in NLP":

**Vector Search Only**:
- Finds documents discussing language models, attention mechanisms, and neural architectures
- Might miss a document that specifically uses the term "transformers" but uses different terminology

**BM25 (Keyword) Only**:
- Finds documents containing the exact terms "transformers" and "NLP"
- Might miss documents that discuss the same concepts using terms like "attention-based models"

**Hybrid Search**:
- Combines both approaches, giving you documents that are conceptually relevant AND documents with exact term matches
- Provides more comprehensive results, especially for technical or specialized queries

Let's see how you would use this in your application:

```python
# Assuming you have documents and vectordb from Part 1
hybrid_retriever = create_hybrid_retriever(vectordb, documents)

# Use hybrid retriever to get more comprehensive results
results = hybrid_retriever.get_relevant_documents("transformers in NLP")
```

### Re-ranking Retrieved Documents for Improved Relevance

Our second advanced technique is re-ranking. This approach:
1. Retrieves a larger set of candidate documents first
2. Uses an LLM to filter and re-rank these documents based on relevance
3. Returns only the most relevant documents

Here's the implementation:

```python
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever

def create_reranking_retriever(llm, base_retriever):
    """
    Create a retriever that first gets candidate documents, then uses an LLM to 
    extract and re-rank the most relevant sections.
    
    Args:
        llm: Language model for re-ranking
        base_retriever: The initial retriever (e.g., vector, hybrid)
        
    Returns:
        ContextualCompressionRetriever: A retriever that filters and re-ranks results
    """
    # Document compressor uses the LLM to extract relevant parts from retrieved docs
    compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)
    
    # Compression retriever wraps the base retriever with the compressor
    compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
        base_compressor=compressor,  # Uses LLM to extract relevant content
        base_retriever=base_retriever  # The original retriever
    )
    
    return compression_retriever
```

#### How Re-ranking Works in Practice

When a user asks a question like "What metrics were used to evaluate the model in the transformer paper?", here's what happens:

1. The base retriever (hybrid or vector) fetches maybe 8-10 candidate documents that might contain the answer
2. The LLM examines each document and extracts ONLY the parts relevant to evaluation metrics
3. Documents with more relevant content about metrics are ranked higher
4. The final result might be 3-4 highly relevant document chunks specifically about evaluation metrics

This process significantly improves precision by:
- Filtering out irrelevant content
- Reducing the amount of context sent to the final LLM
- Extracting specific relevant passages rather than using whole chunks
- Handling longer documents more effectively

Here's how to use re-ranking in your application:

```python
# Create a re-ranking retriever on top of your hybrid retriever
from langchain.llms import Ollama

llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1:8b")
reranking_retriever = create_reranking_retriever(llm, hybrid_retriever)

# Get highly relevant results
refined_results = reranking_retriever.get_relevant_documents("What metrics were used to evaluate the model?")
```

### Self-Query Retriever: Allowing the LLM to Structure the Query

Our third advanced technique is self-query, which allows the LLM to:
1. Analyze a natural language query
2. Extract both search terms and metadata filters
3. Create a structured query that combines both

Here's how to implement it:

```python
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo

def create_self_query_retriever(llm, vectordb, embeddings):
    """
    Create a retriever that uses an LLM to reformulate and structure the query
    for more effective retrieval, including metadata filtering.
    
    Args:
        llm: Language model for query analysis
        vectordb: Vector database for document retrieval
        embeddings: Embedding model for query encoding
        
    Returns:
        SelfQueryRetriever: Smart retriever that can interpret natural language queries
    """
    # Define metadata fields that can be queried
    metadata_field_info = [
        AttributeInfo(
            name="page",
            description="The page number in the document",
            type="integer",
        ),
        AttributeInfo(
            name="section",
            description="The section title of the document",
            type="string",
        ),
    ]
    
    # Create self-query retriever
    retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
        llm=llm,  # LLM that analyzes the query
        vectorstore=vectordb,  # Vector store for retrieval
        document_contents="Academic research paper content",  # Description of documents
        metadata_field_info=metadata_field_info,  # Available metadata fields
        embeddings=embeddings  # Embedding model for the reformulated query
    )
    
    return retriever
```

#### Self-Query in Action

Let's see how self-query handles complex, natural language requests:

1. **Natural Language Query**: "Find methodology sections discussing transformer architecture"
   
   **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
   - The LLM identifies "methodology sections" as a metadata filter
   - It extracts "transformer architecture" as the search content
   - It creates a structured query: `{content: "transformer architecture", metadata: {section: "methodology"}}`

2. **Natural Language Query**: "What did the paper say about transformers on page 4?"
   
   **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
   - The LLM identifies "page 4" as a metadata filter
   - It extracts "transformers" as the search content
   - It creates a structured query: `{content: "transformers", metadata: {page: 4}}`

This is especially powerful when your documents have rich metadata like section titles, authors, publication dates, or categories.

Here's how to use self-query in your application:

```python
# Create a self-query retriever
self_query_retriever = create_self_query_retriever(llm, vectordb, embeddings)

# Use it with natural language queries that include metadata references
results = self_query_retriever.get_relevant_documents(
    "Find limitations mentioned in the conclusion section"
)
```

### Comparison Exercise: Which Retriever Works Best?

Now that we've implemented three advanced retrieval techniques, let's compare them on some challenging queries:

```python
def compare_retrievers(query, retrievers, k=3):
    """Compare different retrievers on the same query."""
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    for name, retriever in retrievers.items():
        print(f"\n{name} results:")
        docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
        
        for i, doc in enumerate(docs[:k]):
            print(f"\nDocument {i+1}:")
            print(f"Source: {doc.metadata.get('source', 'Unknown')}")
            print(f"Page: {doc.metadata.get('page', 'Unknown')}")
            print(f"Content: {doc.page_content[:200]}...")
    
    print("\n" + "=" * 50)

# Set up retrievers
retrievers = {
    "Vector Search": vectordb.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3}),
    "Hybrid Search": create_hybrid_retriever(vectordb, documents),
    "Reranking": create_reranking_retriever(llm, hybrid_retriever),
    "Self-Query": create_self_query_retriever(llm, vectordb, embeddings)
}

# Test queries
test_queries = [
    "What metrics were used to evaluate the model?",
    "How does the paper compare to related work in section 2?",
    "What limitations are mentioned in the conclusion?",
    "Explain the transformer architecture's attention mechanism"
]

# Run comparison
for query in test_queries:
    compare_retrievers(query, retrievers)
```

When running this comparison, you'll notice that:
- Hybrid search performs better for technical terms and specific concepts
- Re-ranking excels at finding precise answers buried in longer texts
- Self-query is best when you need to filter by specific sections or metadata
- Different retrievers shine for different types of queries

In a production system, you might:
1. Use hybrid search as your default retriever
2. Apply re-ranking for precision-critical queries
3. Use self-query when metadata filtering is needed

Let's move on to the next section, where we'll build a multi-document knowledge base.

## Part 2: Building a Multi-Document Knowledge Base (25 minutes)

Real research rarely involves just one paper. To build a truly useful research assistant, we need to process multiple documents while preserving their source information for proper citations. This section shows you how to:
- Process multiple documents with metadata tracking
- Create a searchable index for better citations
- Build summarization tools for quick document understanding
- Develop a document browser interface for easy navigation

### Handling Multiple Documents with Source Tracking

The first step is to create a unified vector store that preserves information about which document each chunk came from:

```python
import os
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

def process_multiple_documents(pdf_directory, persist_dir="db"):
    """
    Process multiple PDF documents and create a unified vector store with source tracking.
    
    Args:
        pdf_directory (str): Directory containing PDF files
        persist_dir (str): Directory to save the vector database
        
    Returns:
        Chroma: Vector database containing all document chunks with metadata
    """
    all_chunks = []
    
    # Get list of PDF files in the directory
    pdf_files = [f for f in os.listdir(pdf_directory) if f.endswith('.pdf')]
    print(f"Found {len(pdf_files)} PDF files")
    
    # Process each PDF file
    for pdf_file in pdf_files:
        pdf_path = os.path.join(pdf_directory, pdf_file)
        print(f"Processing {pdf_file}...")
        
        # Extract filename without extension as document title
        doc_title = os.path.splitext(pdf_file)[0]
        
        # Load PDF and extract text by page
        documents = load_pdf(pdf_path)
        
        # Add document title to metadata for each page
        for doc in documents:
            doc.metadata["source"] = doc_title
            doc.metadata["filename"] = pdf_file
            # Keep existing metadata like page numbers
        
        # Chunk the document into smaller pieces
        chunks = chunk_documents(documents)
        print(f"  Created {len(chunks)} chunks")
        
        # Add all chunks to our collection
        all_chunks.extend(chunks)
    
    print(f"Total chunks across all documents: {len(all_chunks)}")
    
    # Create embeddings and vector store
    embeddings = create_embeddings()
    vectordb = create_vectorstore(all_chunks, embeddings, persist_dir)
    
    return vectordb
```

#### Why Source Tracking is Critical for Research

In academic research, citations matter. Source tracking allows your system to:
1. Cite the original document in responses
2. Enable filtering queries by document source
3. Preserve context about which paper contains what information
4. Support comparative analysis across papers

Let's look at the metadata structure you should maintain for each chunk:

```python
chunk_metadata = {
    "source": "Attention_Is_All_You_Need",   # Document title
    "filename": "attention_is_all_you_need.pdf",  # Original filename
    "page": 3,                               # Page number
    "section": "Methodology",                # Section if available
    "chunk_index": 12                        # Position in document
}
```

This rich metadata ensures your system can always trace information back to its source and provide proper citations.

### Creating a Document Index with Citations

To make your knowledge base more useful, create an index that provides quick access to document metadata:

```python
def create_document_index(pdf_directory):
    """
    Create an index of documents with metadata for citations and quick reference.
    
    Args:
        pdf_directory (str): Directory containing PDF files
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary with document information indexed by title
    """
    document_index = {}
    
    # List PDF files in directory
    pdf_files = [f for f in os.listdir(pdf_directory) if f.endswith('.pdf')]
    
    # Process each PDF
    for pdf_file in pdf_files:
        pdf_path = os.path.join(pdf_directory, pdf_file)
        doc_title = os.path.splitext(pdf_file)[0]
        
        # Extract basic metadata using the PDF loader
        loader = PyPDFLoader(pdf_path)
        documents = loader.load()
        
        # Count pages
        page_count = len(documents)
        
        # Extract text for summarization and preview
        full_text = " ".join([doc.page_content for doc in documents])
        
        # Try to extract publication date and authors (simplified version)
        # In a real system, you would use a more robust method
        publication_info = "Unknown date and authors"
        if len(full_text) > 1000:  # Check if we have enough text
            first_page = documents[0].page_content if documents else ""
            if "20" in first_page[:500]:  # Crude way to look for a year
                # Look for a year in the first 500 chars
                for i in range(len(first_page[:500])-3):
                    if first_page[i:i+2] == "20" and first_page[i:i+4].isdigit():
                        publication_info = f"Published in {first_page[i:i+4]}"
                        break
        
        # Store in index
        document_index[doc_title] = {
            "path": pdf_path,
            "page_count": page_count,
            "text_sample": full_text[:500],  # First 500 chars for preview
            "publication_info": publication_info,
            "total_chars": len(full_text),
        }
    
    return document_index
```

This document index provides:
- Quick access to document metadata without loading full content
- Information for generating proper citations
- Statistics about each document (page count, length)
- Preview text for browsing documents

### Building a Document Summarization Tool

Allow users to quickly understand papers without reading them entirely:

```python
def summarize_document(llm, document_text, max_length=200):
    """
    Generate a concise summary of a document using the LLM.
    
    Args:
        llm: Language model instance
        document_text (str): Text content to summarize
        max_length (int): Target length of summary in words
        
    Returns:
        str: Generated summary of the document
    """
    # Truncate very long documents to avoid context limitations
    # Most LLMs can handle 10,000 chars without issues
    max_context = 10000  
    truncated_text = document_text[:max_context]
    
    # Create a detailed prompt that specifies the expected summary format
    prompt = f"""
    Please provide a concise academic summary of the following research paper text.
    Focus on:
    1. The main research question or objective
    2. The key methodology used
    3. The most significant findings or results
    4. The primary conclusions or implications
    
    Keep the summary to approximately {max_length} words and maintain a formal academic tone.
    
    DOCUMENT TEXT:
    {truncated_text}
    
    SUMMARY:
    """
    
    # Generate summary using the LLM
    summary = llm.invoke(prompt)
    return summary
```

#### Practical Implementation for Multiple Papers

When dealing with multiple papers, you might want to:
1. Summarize each paper individually for detailed understanding
2. Create a comparative summary across related papers
3. Generate targeted summaries of specific sections (methods, results, etc.)

For example, to compare methodologies across papers:

```python
def compare_methodologies(llm, papers_dict):
    """Compare methodologies across multiple papers."""
    # Extract methodology sections from each paper
    methodologies = {}
    for title, info in papers_dict.items():
        # Find methodology section (simplified)
        content = info.get("full_text", "")
        method_section = extract_section(content, ["methodology", "methods", "approach"])
        if method_section:
            methodologies[title] = method_section
    
    # Create comparison prompt
    papers_list = ", ".join(methodologies.keys())
    prompt = f"""
    Compare the methodologies used in the following papers: {papers_list}
    
    For each paper, analyze:
    1. The core techniques/algorithms used
    2. Data collection and preprocessing approaches
    3. Evaluation metrics employed
    
    Then provide a comparative analysis highlighting key similarities and differences.
    
    PAPER METHODOLOGIES:
    """
    
    for title, method in methodologies.items():
        prompt += f"\n\n{title}:\n{method[:2000]}"
    
    comparison = llm.invoke(prompt)
    return comparison
```

## Part 3: Conversational Interface with Memory (20 minutes)

Basic RAG systems answer individual questions but don't remember previous interactions. In this section, you'll enhance your system with:
- Conversation memory that retains context across multiple exchanges
- A chat interface for natural dialogue with your research assistant
- The ability to ask follow-up questions without repeating context

### Understanding Conversation Memory in LLMs

**Why Conversation Memory Matters**:
- Enables multi-turn conversations about complex topics
- Allows follow-up questions like "Can you explain that in more detail?"
- Preserves context across multiple questions
- Makes interactions feel more natural and fluid

**Types of Conversation Memory**:
1. **Buffer Memory**: Stores the complete conversation history
2. **Summary Memory**: Stores a summary of the conversation
3. **Entity Memory**: Tracks specific entities mentioned in the conversation
4. **Window Memory**: Keeps only the most recent exchanges

For our research assistant, we'll use Buffer Memory as it's the most straightforward approach.

### Implementing Conversation Memory
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

def create_conversational_rag(llm, retriever):
    """
    Create a conversational RAG system that maintains memory of previous interactions.
    
    Args:
        llm: Language model instance
        retriever: Document retriever (vector, hybrid, etc.)
        
    Returns:
        ConversationalRetrievalChain: Chain that combines retrieval with conversation history
    """
    # Set up conversation memory
    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
        memory_key="chat_history",    # Key used to store history in the prompt
        return_messages=True          # Return history as a list of messages
    )
    
    # Create conversation chain that combines memory with retrieval
    conversation_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
        llm=llm,                      # Language model
        retriever=retriever,          # Document retriever
        memory=memory                 # Conversation memory
    )
    
    return conversation_chain
```

**How Conversational RAG Works**:
1. When a user asks a question, the system looks at both:
   - The current question
   - The conversation history (previous Q&A pairs)
2. The retriever finds documents relevant to the current question and context
3. The LLM generates a response using:
   - The retrieved documents
   - The conversation history
   - The current question
4. The question and answer are added to the conversation history
5. This process repeats for each new question

### Creating a Chat Interface with Streamlit
```python
import streamlit as st
import os
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma

def chat_interface_tab():
    """
    Streamlit interface for a conversational RAG system with chat history display.
    Provides a natural way to interact with the research assistant through
    multi-turn conversations.
    """
    st.header("Research Assistant Chat")
    st.write("Have a conversation with your research assistant about the papers in your knowledge base")
    
    # Initialize session state for chat history if not exists
    if "messages" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.messages = [
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'm your research assistant. Ask me anything about the papers in your knowledge base."}
        ]
    
    # Check if knowledge base exists before proceeding
    if not os.path.exists("db"):
        st.warning("⚠️ No knowledge base found. Please add documents in the Document Processing tab first.")
        return
    
    # Initialize RAG system if not already done
    if "conversation_chain" not in st.session_state:
        with st.spinner("Loading knowledge base and initializing research assistant..."):
            try:
                # Initialize embeddings and load vector store
                embeddings = create_embeddings()
                vectordb = Chroma(persist_directory="db", embedding_function=embeddings)
                
                # Create retriever - you could use your advanced retrievers here too!

        st.experimental_rerun()
```

### Example Conversation Flow

To understand how conversational memory helps, consider this example conversation:

1. **User**: "What are the key contributions of the 'Attention is All You Need' paper?"
   - *System retrieves information about the paper's contributions*
   - **Assistant**: "The key contributions include introducing the Transformer architecture, self-attention mechanisms, and achieving state-of-the-art results in machine translation..."

2. **User**: "Can you explain self-attention in more detail?"
   - *System understands "self-attention" refers to a concept from the previous answer*
   - *Retrieves specific information about self-attention from the paper*
   - **Assistant**: "Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence..."

3. **User**: "How does this compare to RNN approaches?"
   - *System knows "this" refers to self-attention or Transformers from context*
   - *Retrieves comparison information between Transformers and RNNs*
   - **Assistant**: "Unlike RNNs which process tokens sequentially, the self-attention mechanism processes all tokens in parallel..."

4. **User**: "What were the BLEU scores they achieved?"
   - *System knows "they" refers to the authors of the Transformer paper*
   - *Retrieves performance metrics from the paper*
   - **Assistant**: "The Transformer model achieved a BLEU score of 28.4 on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task..."

Without conversation memory, each question would need to be completely self-contained, making complex research discussions tedious.

### Conversation Memory Optimization Techniques

For advanced applications, consider these optimizations:

1. **Selective Memory**: Only keep relevant parts of the conversation history
   ```python
   # Example: Keep only the last 5 exchanges
   memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=5)
   ```

2. **Summarization**: Periodically summarize the conversation to save context window space
   ```python
   from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
   memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm)
   ```

3. **Token Limiting**: Count tokens in history and truncate if needed
   ```python
   # Pseudocode for token management
   if token_count(history) > max_tokens:
       history = history[-max_tokens:]
   ```

These techniques become important when dealing with very long conversations or when working with models that have limited context windows.

## Part 4: Building an Autonomous Research Agent (30 minutes)

So far, our RAG system responds directly to user questions. Now we'll take it to the next level by creating an **autonomous research agent** that can:
- Break down complex research tasks into sub-steps
- Use specialized tools to gather and analyze information
- Follow a reasoning process to reach conclusions
- Complete sophisticated research tasks with minimal guidance

### Understanding LLM Agents

**What is an LLM Agent?**
An LLM agent combines a language model with:
1. **Tools**: Functions the agent can call to perform specific tasks
2. **Reasoning**: The ability to plan and determine which tools to use
3. **Memory**: Retained information about the task and previous actions
4. **Action**: The capability to execute plans through tool use

This creates a system that can act more autonomously to solve complex problems.

### The Agent Architecture: ReAct Pattern

Our agent follows the **ReAct** pattern (Reasoning + Acting):
1. The agent **observes** the current state (user request, available information)
2. **Reasons** about what to do next (internal thinking)
3. **Acts** by using an appropriate tool
4. **Observes** the result of the action
5. Repeats until the task is complete

### How the Research Agent Works: A Walkthrough

Let's walk through how the agent tackles a complex research task like "Compare the attention mechanisms described in different papers and explain their innovations":

1. **Task Analysis**:
   - Agent recognizes this requires comparing information across papers
   - Determines it needs to find content about attention mechanisms first

2. **Information Gathering**:
   - Agent uses `DocumentSearch` tool with query "attention mechanism innovations"
   - Reviews documents from different papers describing attention mechanisms

3. **Comparison**:
   - Agent might use `ComparePapers` tool to formally compare the approaches
   - Or gather information then synthesize it with reasoning

4. **Clarification**:
   - If information is unclear, agent might use `QuestionAnswering` tool
   - Example: "What is the key innovation in paper X's attention mechanism?"

5. **Synthesis**:
   - Agent organizes information into a structured comparison
   - Highlights key similarities, differences, and innovations
   - Includes proper citations to source papers

6. **Result Presentation**:
   - Returns a comprehensive comparison with academic formatting
   - Cites specific pages and papers for verification

This multi-step process demonstrates how the agent breaks down complex tasks, uses appropriate tools, and synthesizes information - going far beyond what a simple RAG system could accomplish.

## Part 6: Machine Learning Connections and Advanced Concepts (15 minutes)

This section connects RAG systems to fundamental machine learning concepts, helping you understand the mathematical and technical foundations of these systems. We'll explore:
- How vector embeddings represent document semantics
- Visualization of high-dimensional embedding spaces
- Comparing different embedding models
- Advanced similarity metrics

### Understanding Vector Embeddings in RAG

At the core of RAG systems are vector embeddings - dense numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Let's explore how they work and how to visualize them.

#### Vector Similarity Metrics

Documents and queries are compared using similarity metrics in the embedding space:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between vectors
   - Range: -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical)
   - Formula: cos(θ) = (A·B)/(||A||·||B||)
   - Advantage: Insensitive to vector magnitude, focuses on direction

2. **Euclidean Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between points
   - Range: 0 (identical) to ∞ (very different)
   - Formula: d(A,B) = √(Σ(Aᵢ-Bᵢ)²)
   - Advantage: Intuitive geometric interpretation

3. **Dot Product**: The sum of element-wise products
   - Range: Depends on vector magnitudes
   - Formula: A·B = Σ(Aᵢ·Bᵢ)
   - Advantage: Computationally efficient

### Visualizing Document Embeddings
```python
def visualize_embeddings(chunks, embeddings):
    """
    Visualize document embeddings using PCA to reduce dimensions for visualization.
    
    Args:
        chunks: List of document chunks to visualize
        embeddings: Embedding model to use
        
    Returns:
        fig: Plotly figure with 3D visualization of embeddings
    """
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    import pandas as pd
    import plotly.express as px
    
    # Get embeddings for each text chunk
    texts = [chunk.page_content for chunk in chunks]
    print(f"Generating embeddings for {len(texts)} text chunks...")
    
    # Each embedding is typically a vector of 384 dimensions (for MiniLM)
    embedding_vectors = embeddings.embed_documents(texts)
    
    # Convert list of embeddings to numpy array for processing
    embedding_array = np.array(embedding_vectors)
    print(f"Embedding dimensions: {embedding_array.shape}")
    
    # Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce to 3 dimensions
    # PCA finds the directions of maximum variance in the high-dimensional data
    pca = PCA(n_components=3)
    reduced_embeddings = pca.fit_transform(embedding_array)
    
    # Get variance explained by each component
    explained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
    print(f"Variance explained by components: {explained_variance}")
    
    # Create a DataFrame for plotting
    df = pd.DataFrame(reduced_embeddings, columns=['PC1', 'PC2', 'PC3'])
    
    # Add metadata for hover information
    df['text'] = [text[:50] + "..." for text in texts]  # Truncate text for display
    
    # Add page numbers and source documents if available
    df['page'] = [str(chunk.metadata.get('page', 'Unknown')) for chunk in chunks]
    df['source'] = [str(chunk.metadata.get('source', 'Unknown')) for chunk in chunks]
    
    # Create 3D scatter plot with Plotly
    fig = px.scatter_3d(
        df, 
        x='PC1', 
        y='PC2', 
        z='PC3',
        color='source',  # Color points by source document
        symbol='page',   # Different symbols for different pages
        hover_data=['text'],  # Show text on hover
        title=f'Document Embeddings Visualization (Total variance explained: {sum(explained_variance):.2f})',
        labels={
            'PC1': f'PC1 ({explained_variance[0]:.2f} variance)',
            'PC2': f'PC2 ({explained_variance[1]:.2f} variance)',
            'PC3': f'PC3 ({explained_variance[2]:.2f} variance)'
        }
    )
    
    # Improve layout
    fig.update_layout(
        scene=dict(
            xaxis_title='Principal Component 1',
            yaxis_title='Principal Component 2',
            zaxis_title='Principal Component 3'
        ),
        margin=dict(l=0, r=0, b=0, t=40)
    )
    
    return fig
```

**What the Visualization Shows**:
- Similar content clusters together in the embedding space
- Documents on related topics appear closer to each other
- Documents with different topics form separate clusters
- The effectiveness of your embeddings for semantic similarity

**Understanding PCA**:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that:
1. Finds the directions (principal components) of maximum variance in the data
2. Projects the high-dimensional embeddings onto these components
3. Allows visualization of the relationships between documents in 3D space
4. Preserves as much of the original variance as possible

    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary of retrievers for each model
    """
    results = {}
    
    for model_name in model_names:
        print(f"Testing embedding model: {model_name}")
        
        try:
            # Initialize the embedding model
            embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=model_name)
            
            # Create a vector store with this embedding model
            # Use a different directory for each model to avoid conflicts
            model_dir = f"db_{model_name.split('/')[-1]}"
            
            vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(
                documents=chunks,
                embedding=embeddings,
                persist_directory=model_dir
            )
            
            # Set up retriever
            retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
            
            # Store in results
            results[model_name] = {
                "retriever": retriever,
                "embedding_dim": len(embeddings.embed_query("test")),
                "model_size": model_name.split("/")[-1]  # Extract model size from name
            }
            
            print(f"✓ Successfully loaded {model_name}")
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"✗ Error loading {model_name}: {str(e)}")
            # Skip this model
    
    return results
```

**Comparing Embedding Models**:

Different embedding models have various characteristics:

1. **General-purpose models** (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2):
   - Smaller (384 dimensions)
   - Faster inference
   - Good for general text
   - Lower compute requirements

2. **Specialized models** (e.g., multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1):
   - Optimized for question-answering
   - Larger (768 dimensions)
   - Better at matching questions to answers
   - Higher compute requirements

3. **Multilingual models** (e.g., paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2):
   - Support multiple languages
   - Useful for research papers in different languages
   - Usually slightly larger than monolingual versions

        ### Why Similarity Metrics Matter for RAG
        
        The choice of similarity metric affects which documents are retrieved for a query:
        
        - **Cosine Similarity** (most common): Focuses on direction rather than magnitude, good for text where vector length shouldn't matter
        
        - **Euclidean Distance**: Considers both direction and magnitude, useful when the absolute values matter
        
        - **Dot Product**: Favors longer vectors, can be useful when document length/importance should be factored in
        
        Most RAG systems use cosine similarity by default, but experimenting with different metrics can improve retrieval for specific use cases.
        """)
```

### Advanced Embedding Concepts

For those wanting to go deeper into embeddings, here are some advanced concepts to explore:

1. **Contrastive Training**:
   - How embedding models are trained using positive and negative examples
   - Brings similar items closer, pushes different items apart
   - Used in models like SimCSE and CLIP

2. **Cross-Encoders vs. Bi-Encoders**:
   - Bi-encoders (used in our RAG): Encode query and document separately
   - Cross-encoders: Encode query and document together
   - Cross-encoders are more accurate but can't pre-compute embeddings

3. **Dimensionality Considerations**:
   - Higher dimensions can capture more information
   - But face diminishing returns and higher computational costs
   - Finding the right embedding size is a trade-off between quality and speed

4. **Fine-tuning Embeddings**:
   - Domain adaptation of general embeddings
   - Transfer learning for specific tasks
   - Techniques like MTEB (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark) for evaluation
