<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from its current position at (0,4) to the apple at (4,1). The snake is currently moving DOWN, but since it's just starting, the direction is NONE according to the input. Wait, no—the current direction is DOWN, right? Or wait, the head is at (0,4), and the body cells are given as [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5)]. So that means the snake's body is along the left edge of the grid, starting from (0,5) up to (0,9). The head is at (0,4), which is just below the body. 

Wait, but the direction can't reverse, so if the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP because that would be reversing. Wait, no—the initial direction given is DOWN, so the snake was moving down to reach its current head position. But now, from (0,4), we need to plan a path towards (4,1). 

First, I should note the coordinates. The grid is 10x10, with (0,0) being bottom-left and (9,9) top-right. So moving UP increases y by 1, DOWN decreases it, RIGHT increases x by 1, LEFT decreases.

The apple is at (4,1), which is to the right and a bit down from the head's current position. Wait, no: (0,4) is on the left side, and (4,1) is more to the right but also lower in y-coordinate, so it's down-right from the head.

The Manhattan distance between (0,4) and (4,1) is 4 + 3 = 7. So that's a good heuristic to know how many moves we need at minimum.

But movement is constrained by the snake's body and walls. The current body cells are [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5)]. So the snake is currently a vertical line along x=0 from y=5 to y=9, with the head at (0,4). 

So when moving, we need to make sure that each new head position doesn't collide with any body cells. Also, after each move, the tail moves unless an apple is eaten, which in this case hasn't happened yet.

The initial direction is DOWN, so the snake's previous movement was downward from (0,5) to (0,4). Now, the next move can't be UP because that would reverse direction. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. But looking at the grid, moving LEFT from (0,4) isn't possible since x=0 is the leftmost column—so it's a wall collision.

So first move options: RIGHT or DOWN. Let's see where each leads.

Option 1: Move RIGHT to (1,4). Then we need to plan the rest of the path. But wait, moving right from (0,4) would take us into x=1, y=4. From there, the next moves should be towards the apple at (4,1).

But also, after each move, the body shifts. So if we make a move that causes the new head to be where the body is, it's a collision.

Wait, but in the current state, the snake's body includes all positions from (0,5) up to (0,9), and the head is at (0,4). So after moving right, the head becomes (1,4), then the tail moves because no apple was eaten yet. The new body would be [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], and the head is (1,4).

Wait, but if we move right, do we have any collision? Let's see: after moving to (1,4), the next body positions are (0,5) to (0,9). So as long as (1,4) isn't in the body, it's safe. Since the body is at x=0, y from 5 to 9, and we're moving to x=1, y=4, that's clear.

So first move: RIGHT.

Now, next moves: from (1,4), need to go towards (4,1). The Manhattan distance is now 3 in x and 3 in y. But direction can't reverse; the previous move was RIGHT, so next move can be DOWN or LEFT or RIGHT again? Wait, no—each movement can only change direction if it's not a reversal. So from RIGHT, you can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

Wait, wait: The current move is to the right, which is in the x-direction. So the previous direction was RIGHT. Therefore, the next direction can't be LEFT because that would reverse. But since the movement rule says cannot reverse direction. Wait, no—rule 3 says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if moving in a certain direction, it can't switch to the opposite immediately. For example, if you're moving UP, you can't move DOWN next.

So from RIGHT, you can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

Wait, but after moving right, the current direction is now RIGHT. Wait no—the initial direction was NONE because the head's position is (0,4), and body cells suggest that it came down from above. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding: in the given state, the snake's current direction is DOWN? Or wait, the input says current direction is DOWN.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "Current direction: DOWN". So after each move, the direction changes unless it continues in the same way.

Wait no—the movement rules say that the direction can be any of the four, except that you can't reverse. So if the current direction is NONE (the initial state), then the first move can be any direction except perhaps not reversing— but wait, rule 3 says the snake cannot reverse on the next step. But since it's NONE, meaning no previous direction, so all moves are allowed.

Wait, in the problem statement: the current direction is DOWN. So after each movement, the direction changes unless continued. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me clarify:

The initial state has head at (0,4), body cells [(1,9), (0,9), ..., (0,5)], and current direction is DOWN. So the snake was moving DOWN to reach its current position.

So when planning moves, the first move can't be UP because that would reverse from DOWN. Because rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. So if current direction is DOWN, next move can't be UP.

Wait, but wait: according to movement rules, point 3 says "cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next)". So if the current direction is DOWN, the next move cannot be UP, because that's reversing. Similarly, moving LEFT after RIGHT or vice versa would be a reversal.

So in this case, initial direction is DOWN, so first move can't be UP.

But wait, in the given state, the head is at (0,4), and the body cells are above it—so the snake is in a vertical line from (0,5) up to (0,9). So the last movement was DOWN because the snake moved down into (0,4). Now, the current direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP.

But wait, moving DOWN would take the head further down—(0,3), but that's below y=0? No, since y ranges from 0 to 9. So moving DOWN from (0,4) to (0,3) is allowed, but then what about the next moves?

Alternatively, can we move RIGHT first? Because that wouldn't reverse direction.

So let me try that: move RIGHT to (1,4). Now, check for collisions: body cells are [(1,9), (0,9), ..., (0,5)]—so no overlap with (1,4).

Next moves need to go towards (4,1) from (1,4). The path should be right and down.

But also, after each move, the snake's body shifts unless an apple is eaten. So we can't have any of our new head positions overlapping with the body after movement.

Wait, but in this case, since we're moving towards the apple, perhaps it's better to plan a path that avoids the body and walls.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first would take us to (0,3), which is further down. But then from there, how do we proceed? Since we can't reverse direction after that.

But wait, if we move RIGHT first, let's see:

Move 1: RIGHT → (1,4). Now the snake's body becomes [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], and head is at (1,4).

Next, from (1,4), possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But we can't move UP because that would reverse from the previous direction of RIGHT? Wait no—each movement's allowed directions depend on the current direction.

Wait, after moving RIGHT, the new direction is RIGHT. So next move cannot be LEFT. So from (1,4), possible moves are DOWN, UP, or RIGHT again.

But moving UP could take us towards (1,5), but that might not help. Moving DOWN towards (1,3) seems better for approaching the apple.

So move 2: DOWN → (1,3). Now body is [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], head at (1,3).

Wait no—wait, when you move, the tail moves unless an apple is eaten. Since we haven't eaten the apple yet, moving causes the tail to shift.

So after first move: body cells are [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], head at (1,4).

After second move, moving DOWN to (1,3): body becomes [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)]—the tail moves from (0,5) to (0,6)? Wait no, the tail is the last part of the body. So when you move, the head moves, and each segment follows. So after moving right, the new body would be [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], with head at (1,4). Then moving DOWN: new head is (1,3), and the body becomes [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7)]. Because the tail was at (0,6) and it moves to (0,7), but no—wait, when you move, each segment follows the previous one.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach: plan a path that gets the head towards the apple without stepping on body cells.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN first would take us into a position where we can then move right.

Wait, but initial direction is DOWN, so first move cannot be UP, but can it be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN?

From (0,4), moving DOWN takes us to (0,3). Then, next move could be RIGHT, etc.

But let's see:

Move 1: DOWN → (0,3). Now body is [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], head at (0,3).

Then, can we move right? From (0,3), moving RIGHT to (1,3) is allowed. Then next moves could proceed towards the apple.

But I'm not sure if this path would avoid collisions. Let me try mapping it out:

After first move: head at (0,3). Body is [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7)], as tail moved from (0,5) to (0,6).

Wait no, because when moving DOWN from (0,4) to (0,3), the body cells are [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)]. So after moving down, the new head is at (0,3), and the tail becomes (0,5). Wait no—when you move, the tail moves as well. But since we didn't eat an apple, the snake's length remains the same minus one each time.

Wait, I'm getting confused about how the body updates. Let me clarify:

Snake movement update per move:

- New head = current head + direction vector.
- Then, each body cell follows the previous one.
- Tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So in this case, the initial snake has a head at (0,4) and body cells [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5)]. Wait no—that can't be right because the body should trail behind the head. So perhaps I misunderstood the initial state.

Wait, in the input, the body cells are given as [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5)]. That would mean that after the head at (0,4), the next part is (0,5), then (0,6), etc., up to (0,9) and (1,9). But that seems like the body is going upward from (0,5) to (0,9) and then to (1,9).

Wait, perhaps the body cells are listed in order from head to tail. So the head is at (0,4), followed by (0,5), then (0,6), up to (0,9), then (1,9). That would make sense because it's a vertical line with the head at (0,4) and body going up.

But that can't be right because the head is at (0,4), and the next cell in body would be (0,5), which is directly below. So the snake is moving upward? Because the last move was DOWN to reach (0,4). Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the body cells are given from tail to head. Let me think: if the head is at (0,4), and the body follows as [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], that would mean the snake is in a loop? Because after (0,6) comes (0,7), which is above it.

Wait, I think perhaps the initial state is such that the snake is in a vertical line from (0,4) down to (0,5), then (0,6), etc., but that doesn't make sense because moving DOWN would take you away from the body. Maybe I should just proceed with planning a path.

Another approach: since we need to move towards the apple at (4,1), which is to the right and down from the current head position.

So perhaps the optimal path is to first move RIGHT as much as possible, then DOWN.

But considering the initial direction is DOWN, so first move cannot be UP. So moving RIGHT is allowed.

Move 1: RIGHT → (1,4). Now body cells are [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], and head at (1,4).

Wait no—when you move right from (0,4) to (1,4), the body cells shift. The previous head was (0,4), followed by (0,5). So moving right would make the new head (1,4), and the body would be [(0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,9)]? That doesn't seem right.

I think I'm getting stuck on the initial setup. Maybe I should instead focus on what needs to happen: get the head from (0,4) to (4,1) without stepping on body cells or reversing direction in a way that's not allowed.

Another idea: perhaps move DOWN a few times first to get away from the initial vertical line, then start moving right.

But with the initial direction being DOWN, the first move can't be UP. So move DOWN:

Move 1: DOWN → (0,3). Now body cells are [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], head at (0,3).

Now, direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP. So from (0,3), we can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Moving DOWN again to (0,2):

Move 2: DOWN → (0,2). Body becomes [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7)], head at (0,2).

Now, direction is still DOWN. Next moves could be more DOWNs, but that's not helpful for getting towards the apple.

Alternatively, from (0,3), move RIGHT to (1,3):

Move 2: RIGHT → (1,3). Now body cells are [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7)], head at (1,3).

Now direction is RIGHT, so next moves can't be LEFT.

From here, we need to move towards (4,1). So move DOWN:

Move 3: DOWN → (1,2). Body becomes [(0,9), (0,8)], head at (1,2).

Continue moving DOWN:

Move 4: DOWN → (1,1). Body becomes [(0,9)], head at (1,1).

Now we're close to the apple. Move RIGHT:

Move 5: RIGHT → (2,1). Then continue moving RIGHT until reach (4,1):

But wait, after each move, the body shifts, so as long as we don't step on our own body, it's okay.

Alternatively, this path seems too long and might not be optimal. Maybe there's a better way.

Another idea: from (0,4), move RIGHT to (1,4). Then DOWN to (1,3). Then RIGHT again to (2,3). Then DOWN to (2,2), etc., but I'm not sure.

I think the key is to plan a path that systematically moves right and down without crossing over the body cells. Since the initial body is vertical from (0,5) up, moving right first would avoid collision with the body.

So let's try:

Move 1: RIGHT → (1,4). Now body is [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], head at (1,4).

Check for collisions: no overlap between (1,4) and body.

Move 2: DOWN → (1,3). Body becomes [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7)], head at (1,3).

No collision.

Move 3: RIGHT → (2,3). Body becomes [(0,9), (0,8)], head at (2,3).

Continue moving RIGHT:

Move 4: RIGHT → (3,3). Body becomes [(0,9)], head at (3,3).

Move 5: DOWN → (3,2). Now we're getting closer.

Move 6: DOWN → (3,1).

Now, move RIGHT to reach the apple:

Move 7: RIGHT → (4,1).

Wait, but when moving from (3,1) to (4,1), do we step on any body cells? The body after move 6 is [(0,9)], so no collision.

So total moves would be 7 steps. But I'm not sure if this is the minimal path or if there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first then RIGHT is more efficient.

But considering the initial direction constraints, perhaps moving RIGHT first is necessary.

Wait, but in my earlier plan, after move 6, head is at (3,1). Then moving RIGHT to (4,1) would be the seventh move. But since we need to reach (4,1), that's acceptable.

However, I'm not sure if this path would work because each time you move, the body cells are shifting, and I might have missed some collision points.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move diagonally by alternating right and down moves, but since it's grid movement, you can't move diagonally—only in four directions.

Another consideration: after moving RIGHT and DOWN, the body may block certain paths. For example, if we move too far right, the body might extend into that area.

But given the initial body is vertical from (0,4) upward to (0,9), moving right first seems safer.

So I think the path would be:

1. RIGHT → (1,4)

2. DOWN → (1,3)

3. RIGHT → (2,3)

4. DOWN → (2,2)

5. RIGHT → (3,2)

6. DOWN → (3,1)

7. RIGHT → (4,1)

That's seven moves in total.

But I need to check if each step doesn't collide with the body at that point.

After move 1: body is [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], head at (1,4). No collision.

Move 2: DOWN → (1,3). Body becomes [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7)]. Still no collision.

Move 3: RIGHT → (2,3). Body becomes [(0,9), (0,8)]. No collision.

Move 4: DOWN → (2,2). Body becomes [(0,9)]. No collision.

Move 5: RIGHT → (3,2). Body is gone except for the head? Wait no—each move reduces the body size unless an apple is eaten. So after each move without eating the apple, the body loses a segment.

Wait, but in this problem, we're moving towards the apple, so we'll eat it when we reach (4,1). But until then, we lose body segments with each move.

So let's track body cells step by step:

Initial state:

Head: (0,4)

Body: [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)]

So the snake is from (0,4) up to (0,5), then (0,6), etc., but I think this initial body setup might be incorrect. Maybe it's better to consider that the body cells are listed in order from tail to head.

Wait, perhaps the body cells are given as a list starting from the tail and moving towards the head. So the last cell is the closest to the head.

In that case, the initial body would be:

Tail at (0,5), then (0,6), up to (0,9), then (1,9). But this seems like a loop, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the body cells are listed in order from the head's previous positions. So the head is at (0,4), and the next cell is where it was before that—(0,5).

So moving right from (0,4) to (1,4): new head is (1,4). The old head (0,4) becomes part of the body.

Wait, this might be a better way to model it:

Each move adds a new head and removes the tail unless eating an apple.

But in our case, since we're not eating any apples until the end, each move shifts the body by one segment, losing the last one.

So let's try to track the body after each move without having eaten the apple yet.

Initial state:

Head: (0,4)

Body: [(0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,9)] ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think that with each move, the body follows the path of the head.

So starting at (0,4), moving right to (1,4):

Body becomes [(0,4), (0,5)], but since we haven't eaten anything yet, the tail is removed, so body is just [(0,5)] after first move?

No, perhaps each time you move, the head moves and the rest of the body follows. So the body is a queue that follows the head.

Wait, in snake games, when you don't eat food, moving forward causes the tail to disappear.

So initial body:

Cells: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,9)

But that seems too long. Maybe the initial setup is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial body is only [(0,5)], with head at (0,4).

So each move:

Move 1: RIGHT → (1,4). Body becomes [(0,4), (0,5)]. Since we didn't eat, remove tail: body is [(0,5)].

Wait no—when you move, the new head is added, and if no food eaten, the last cell is removed. So:

Initial state:

Head: (0,4)

Body: [ ]

After moving right:

New head: (1,4)

Body becomes [ (0,4) ]

But since we didn't eat, body remains just [ (0,4) ].

Wait, that can't be right because the snake would disappear after one move.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe in this problem, the initial body is a straight line, and as you move, it follows but doesn't grow unless you eat.

But since we're not eating until the end, each move shifts the body without growing.

Given that, perhaps moving right first is safe because the initial body is behind.

So to conclude, I think the minimal number of moves required is seven: moving RIGHT four times and DOWN three times, but considering the grid movement and direction constraints, it might be more. However, given the initial position, moving towards the goal without reversing directions too much should work.

But wait, another consideration: after each move, you can't reverse direction immediately because that would cause collision with your own body. So if you move right, then down, you can continue in those directions.

So perhaps the minimal path is:

Right 4 times and Down 3 times, totaling 7 moves.

Therefore, I think the answer is 7 moves.
</think>

The minimum number of moves required for the snake to reach the apple located at (4,1) from its starting position at (0,4) without colliding with itself is seven.

$\boxed{7}$
