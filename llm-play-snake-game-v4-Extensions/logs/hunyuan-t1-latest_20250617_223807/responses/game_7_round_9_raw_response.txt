{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 4 times (to reduce x from 6 to 2) and down once (to reduce y from 4 to 3). Moving left first avoids collision with the body (initially along x=6 and x=5) and ensures a safe path. After reaching (2,4), moving down to (2,3) (apple) is safe as the apple is not occupied by the body. Post-apple, there are legal moves (e.g., left) to avoid trapping."
