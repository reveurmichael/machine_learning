========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 4 units right (from x=1 to x=5) and 1 unit up (from y=1 to y=2). Starting with UP avoids reversing the initial LEFT direction and moves toward the apple's y-coordinate. Subsequent RIGHT moves incrementally approach the apple's x-coordinate. Each move is checked for collisions with the body (which shifts safely as the tail moves normally until the apple is eaten). After reaching the apple, the snake can safely move UP or RIGHT next, avoiding entrapment."
