trick work correctly
 

103
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,390
trick work correctly

104
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
my prediction should match the same card
 

105
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,670

that you picked the six of diamonds now

106
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680

this trick was originally performed by

108
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,270
this trick was originally performed by
 

109
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,900
this trick was originally performed by
Harry Lorayne and let's just get into

110
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:41,910
Harry Lorayne and let's just get into
 

111
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,830
Harry Lorayne and let's just get into
how it's done now of course I have the

112
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
how it's done now of course I have the
 

113
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,540
how it's done now of course I have the
card shuffle my spectator it really

114
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:47,550
card shuffle my spectator it really
 

115
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,830
card shuffle my spectator it really
doesn't matter how they shuffle the deck

116
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
doesn't matter how they shuffle the deck
 

117
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,390
doesn't matter how they shuffle the deck
or how they cut it whatever they want to

118
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
or how they cut it whatever they want to
 

119
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,580
or how they cut it whatever they want to
do as long as there are cards in the

120
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:52,590
do as long as there are cards in the
 

121
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,100
do as long as there are cards in the
deck worth it so now first thing I do

122
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,110
deck worth it so now first thing I do
 

123
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,840
deck worth it so now first thing I do
that you saw is I spread the cards out

124
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:56,850
that you saw is I spread the cards out
 

125
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,350
that you saw is I spread the cards out
and the reason I do this is two reasons

126
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,360
and the reason I do this is two reasons
 

127
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,510
and the reason I do this is two reasons
want to pick out my prediction card and

128
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:02,520
want to pick out my prediction card and
 

129
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,710
want to pick out my prediction card and
two to get a peek at the top the second

130
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
two to get a peek at the top the second
 

131
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,890
two to get a peek at the top the second
card from the top so I take a peek of a

132
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:09,900
card from the top so I take a peek of a
 

133
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,690
card from the top so I take a peek of a
second card from the top first in this

134
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:11,700
second card from the top first in this
 

135
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,210
second card from the top first in this
case we see that it's the five of Hearts

136
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,220
case we see that it's the five of Hearts
 

137
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,240
case we see that it's the five of Hearts
so now your prediction card is going to

138
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,250
so now your prediction card is going to
 

139
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,230
so now your prediction card is going to
be the five of diamonds so we go to the

140
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,240
be the five of diamonds so we go to the
 

141
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,580
be the five of diamonds so we go to the
deck we find the five of diamonds and I

142
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:25,590
deck we find the five of diamonds and I
 

143
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,320
deck we find the five of diamonds and I
place it to the side face-up and the

144
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,330
place it to the side face-up and the
 

145
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,710
place it to the side face-up and the
reason I don't explain the importance of

146
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:33,720
reason I don't explain the importance of
 

147
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,080
reason I don't explain the importance of
this yet is because I want to talk about

148
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,090
this yet is because I want to talk about
 

149
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,020
this yet is because I want to talk about
it while covering another move that I do

150
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,030
it while covering another move that I do
 

151
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,280
it while covering another move that I do
so for now I'll just put it over to the

152
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,290
so for now I'll just put it over to the
 

153
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,940
so for now I'll just put it over to the
side okay and at this point I like to

154
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:43,950
side okay and at this point I like to
 

155
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,940
side okay and at this point I like to
give the deck a false shuffle to retain

156
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:46,950
give the deck a false shuffle to retain
 

157
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,710
give the deck a false shuffle to retain
the second card from the top but have

158
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
the second card from the top but have
 

159
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,600
the second card from the top but have
the spectator think that the card was

160
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:50,610

retaining that second card

166
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:00,790
retaining that second card
 

167
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,160
retaining that second card
now the next thing we need is that for

168
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,170
now the next thing we need is that for
 

169
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,280
now the next thing we need is that for
the spectator to pick five cards and it

170
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,290
the spectator to pick five cards and it
 

171
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,420
the spectator to pick five cards and it
really doesn't matter what cards they

172
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,430
really doesn't matter what cards they
 

173
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,250
really doesn't matter what cards they
pick we're just gonna go through the

174
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,260
pick we're just gonna go through the
 

175
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,770
pick we're just gonna go through the
deck and have them touch five cards so

176
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:11,780
deck and have them touch five cards so
 

177
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,380
deck and have them touch five cards so
let's say this one okay we're just gonna

178
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,390
let's say this one okay we're just gonna
 

179
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,260
let's say this one okay we're just gonna
have it protrude about half way but half

180
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,270
have it protrude about half way but half
 

181
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,410
have it protrude about half way but half
the card here and then next one also

182
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,420
the card here and then next one also
 

183
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,340
the card here and then next one also
have now the third card that we get - we

184
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,350
have now the third card that we get - we
 

185
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,490
have now the third card that we get - we
want to stick it out about two-thirds so

186
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:27,500
want to stick it out about two-thirds so
 

187
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,800
want to stick it out about two-thirds so
as you can see this card for trude's out

188
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:29,810
as you can see this card for trude's out
 

189
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,590
as you can see this card for trude's out
more than these two cars okay and I'll

190
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:32,600
more than these two cars okay and I'll
 

191
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
more than these two cars okay and I'll
get to why in a second so that's three

192
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:34,610
get to why in a second so that's three
 

193
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,450
get to why in a second so that's three
cards that's four and that's five now

194
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:40,460
cards that's four and that's five now
 

195
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,950
cards that's four and that's five now
the reason we have the third card here

196
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:43,960
the reason we have the third card here
 

197
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,360
the reason we have the third card here
protruding the most is because we're

198
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,370
protruding the most is because we're
 

199
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,760
protruding the most is because we're
gonna push the last two cards back into

200
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:48,770
gonna push the last two cards back into
 

201

the deck we're gonna push the last two
cards back into the deck okay and we're

204
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:53,990
cards back into the deck okay and we're
 

205
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,810
cards back into the deck okay and we're
gonna do it under the cover of the third

206
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:55,820

293
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,700
the top card of the two packet is gonna
go in the middle of the first two cards

294
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:52,710
go in the middle of the first two cards
 

295
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,300

Hearts is gonna go between the bottom
 

299
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,240
Hearts is gonna go between the bottom
two parts just like that and then we're

300
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,250
two parts just like that and then we're
 

301
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,379
two parts just like that and then we're
going to repeat this process one more

302
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:03,389
going to repeat this process one more
 

303
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,330
going to repeat this process one more
time so split it up into three and two

304
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:05,340
time so split it up into three and two
 

305
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,909
