========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 7 units right (from x=1 to 8) and 4 units down (from y=4 to 0). Starting with RIGHT avoids reversing the initial UP direction and navigates around the body. After reaching (8,4), moving DOWN avoids body collisions as the tail shifts away, leading safely to the apple at (8,0)."
