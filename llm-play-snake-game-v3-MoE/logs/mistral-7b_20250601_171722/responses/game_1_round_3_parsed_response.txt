```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "To avoid immediate self-collision and ensure continuous body movement, we choose 'DOWN' first to move towards the apple while keeping distance from the current head position. Then, we move 'LEFT' since the next cell is empty in the given state, ensuring no collision. This initial path does not trap ourselves or block further movement."
