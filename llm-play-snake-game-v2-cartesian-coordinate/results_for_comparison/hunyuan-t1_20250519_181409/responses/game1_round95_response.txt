  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 7 times to align with the apple's x-coordinate (8) and then down once to reach the apple's y-coordinate (4). Each move is checked for collisions with the body and walls. The path avoids the body by moving around it through the upper area, ensuring safe progression towards the apple."
