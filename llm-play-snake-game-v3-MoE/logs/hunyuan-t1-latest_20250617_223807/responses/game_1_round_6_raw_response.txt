========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left (from x=4 to x=1) and down (from y=7 to y=1). Starting with LEFT moves avoids reversing direction and navigates toward the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent DOWN moves align with the apple's y-coordinate. Each move is checked for collisions with the body (which shifts safely as the tail moves), and the final move to the apple leaves room for a legal next move (e.g., LEFT or DOWN)."
