## general

v0.04 will be able to generate csv dataset, with language sentences.


## heuristics 





v0.04 is Only for heuristics. We don't have v0.04 for supervized learning models. Not for genetic algorithm/evolutionary algorithms. 


The other thing I am thinking about, for heurstics v0.04, which is based on v0.03, hence is, since I will be having Task4: fine tuning LLM models, I will have to have long long long language sentences telling how the heuristics working (inserted into each key decision point of the heuristics, so the when fine tuning LLM models, we can have the language sentences telling how the heuristics working), guiding LLM's to learn how to play snake game.



The most important thing about v0.04 is csv dataset generation with language sentences.

## supervized learning models

No need for v0.04 for supervized learning models.
