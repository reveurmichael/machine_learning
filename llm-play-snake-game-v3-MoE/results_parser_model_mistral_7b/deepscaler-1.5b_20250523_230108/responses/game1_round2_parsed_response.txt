{"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (6,5) with direction RIGHT. Moving to (7,5) avoids immediate collision and sets the next position for a potential upward movement toward the apple at (5,6). This path ensures each move is valid and leads towards the target without blocking future steps."}
