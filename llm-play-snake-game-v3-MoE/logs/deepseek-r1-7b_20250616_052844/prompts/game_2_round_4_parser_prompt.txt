========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to help this user. They've presented a scenario where a snake is at (1,3) and needs to reach an apple at (3,2). The snake's current direction is "LEFT", and there are no body segments except for the head since the body list is empty.

First, I should recall the movement rules. The snake can't reverse its direction immediately if it's moving in one way. Since it's currently going LEFT, moving RIGHT on the next step would be allowed. Also, the apple is at (3,2), which is two units to the right and one unit down from the head.

Looking at the required path, I need to calculate how many moves are needed in each direction. The horizontal distance between x=1 and x=3 is 2, so we need two RIGHT moves. Vertically, y decreases by 1 since it's moving down from y=3 to y=2, which requires one DOWN move.

So the sequence should be two RIGHTs followed by one DOWN. That makes three moves in total: RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN. I'll have to check if this path is collision-free and doesn't involve reversing directions.

Since the snake can only move LEFT or RIGHT first without reversing, moving right twice is okay. Then moving down shouldn't be a problem because there's no body blocking the way yet.

I should also ensure that after each move, the snake doesn't collide with its own body. Since it starts empty and growing when it eats the apple, but in this case, it's not eating anything except the head movement first.

Wait, does the direction affect whether moving RIGHT twice is allowed? The current direction is LEFT, so moving RIGHT next is fine because you can't reverse direction from a previous move unless you didn't just come from the opposite. So yes, moving RIGHT twice should be okay.

Putting it all together, the moves are RIGHT, RIGHT, then DOWN to reach the apple safely.
</think>

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move right twice and then down to reach the apple without reversing direction or colliding with body segments."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (1, 3) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (3, 2). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
