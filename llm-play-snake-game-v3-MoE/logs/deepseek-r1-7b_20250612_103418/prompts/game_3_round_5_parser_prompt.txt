<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this classic Snake game problem where the snake starts at position (1,1) moving DOWN. The apple is at (8,5). My goal is to plan a safe path for the snake's head to reach the apple without colliding with itself or getting stuck.

First, let me visualize the starting point and the target. The snake is at (1,1), which is the bottom-left corner of the grid since y increases upwards. The apple is at (8,5), so it's near the top-right but shifted to the left a bit.

The snake has no body segments because the Body cells list is empty. That means the head can move in any direction without worrying about the body catching up immediately. But I need to make sure that as it moves towards the apple, there's enough space for the body to follow later.

Since the snake starts at (1,1) moving DOWN, its next position would be (1,0), which is outside the grid because y can't be less than 0. Wait, no—(0 ≤ x < 10 and 0 ≤ y < 10). So actually, (1,0) is on the edge but still within bounds. But moving DOWN from (1,1) would go to (1,0), which is allowed.

But wait, can I move UP? The initial direction is DOWN, so according to the rules, if current direction is "DOWN", you may not choose "UP" next because they are opposite directions. So my first move cannot be UP; it has to be either RIGHT, LEFT, or NONE (but NONE doesn't make sense here since we're moving towards the apple).

Wait no—the problem says that movement updates include checking for collisions with the body, but since there's no body yet, the snake can move in any direction except reversing on the first move. But looking at the rules:

Under Movement Rules:
1. Valid directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
2. Cannot reverse: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed.

Wait, the initial direction is "DOWN". So my first move cannot be "UP" because they are opposite directions. But can I choose LEFT or RIGHT? Yes, unless they reverse each other.

But to reach the apple at (8,5), which is right 7 and up 4 from (1,1). So the snake needs to go right a lot. Let's plan a path that goes mostly RIGHT but also adjusts as needed.

Let me think about possible moves:

First move options: LEFT, RIGHT, or keep moving DOWN? But if I keep going DOWN, y decreases, which is moving towards higher y values (since down in the problem means y-1). Wait no—the coordinate system has "UP" as +y and "DOWN" as -y. So from (1,1), moving DOWN would go to (1,0), but that's actually going away from the apple at (8,5) because we need to increase x towards 8.

So perhaps the first move should be RIGHT instead of DOWN or LEFT.

Wait, no: current direction is "DOWN". So I can't reverse it yet. Wait, initial direction is DOWN, and cannot choose UP next; but I can choose RIGHT or LEFT.

Hmm, maybe moving RIGHT first to start increasing x towards 8 would be better. Let's see:

Move RIGHT from (1,1) to (2,1). Now the snake's head is at (2,1), direction remains RIGHT because movement update uses current direction unless it changes based on new_head and apple position.

But since we're not eating the apple yet, we just move normally. So after moving RIGHT once, the snake becomes [(2,1), (1,1)]? Wait no—body updates are that old head is added to the front, and if not growing, the tail is removed.

Wait initial S is [ (1,1) ]. Moving RIGHT:

new_head = (2,1). Check for collision: no body except after update. Then insert (1,1) at front of BODY list, which was empty before. So new body becomes [(2,1), (1,1)]. Wait no—the initial body is empty because the body cells are given as an empty list.

Wait wait, in the problem statement, Body cells include everything from behind to tail except head. If the snake has length 2, then it's [HEAD, BODY1].

So starting at (1,1), moving RIGHT would make new_head=(2,1). Then since no apple eaten yet, the body grows by adding HEAD to the front and removing the tail. So the new body becomes [(2,1), (1,1)]? Or is it [new_head, old_head]? Because in movement update:

a. Insert old head at front of BODY list.

b. If not eating apple, remove last element (tail).

So initial state: S = [ (1,1) ], Body cells are empty. After moving RIGHT:

new_head = (2,1). Since no collision, insert (1,1) to the front of the body list which was empty, making the new body [(2,1), (1,1)]. Then since not eating apple, remove tail: remove last element which is (1,1), so the new S becomes [ (2,1) ].

Wait no—no. The movement update says:

After computing new_head and checking for collision, update body positions by inserting old head at front of BODY list, then if not eating, remove tail.

So in initial state: S is [HEAD], Body is empty.

After moving RIGHT, new_head = (2,1). Since no collision, insert HEAD (1,1) to the front of the empty body. So now the body becomes [(1,1)]. Then since not eating apple, remove tail—since the body was just [(1,1)], removing it leaves an empty list.

Wait that can't be right because then the snake would have no body segments after moving? Or wait—the movement update rules say:

In step 3a: insert old head at front of BODY (which is [ (1,1) ]). So the new body becomes [(1,1), (1,1)]?

Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe when inserting old head to the front, if the snake was only HEAD before, then the new body list will have one element: old head.

But since no tail removal happens unless it's an apple-eating move.

So after moving RIGHT once:

S becomes [ (2,1) ] as the new head, and the body is [(1,1)].

Wait that can't be because the body should consist of all segments behind the head. So when you insert old_head at front of the current body, which was empty, then the new S is [new_head] + body (which is empty). But according to step 3a: "Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1)".

If initial Body is empty, then after inserting, Body becomes [old_head]. Then in step 3b, since not eating apple, remove tail. So if Body was [old_head], removing it would leave an empty list. But that's impossible because a snake needs at least one body segment to move—it can't have zero segments.

Wait no—the initial state is S = [HEAD] and Body cells are empty. After moving RIGHT once:

- new_head = (2,1)
- Check for collision: none
- Insert old_head (1,1) at front of Body list (empty), so Body becomes [(1,1)]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (the last element is (1,1)), but the body after insertion has only one element. So removing it would make the body empty.

But then S would be [new_head] with an empty body? That can't be right because a snake must have at least two segments: head and body. Wait no—actually, in the initial state, when the snake's length is 1 (head only), the body list is empty. After moving once without eating apple:

S = [new_head] + Body after insertion - tail.

But if Body was [(old_head)], then removing old_head would make it empty again. So S becomes [new_head].

That seems incorrect because a snake can't move with no body segments—it must have at least one segment beyond the head? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body is maintained.

Wait, perhaps when the snake moves without eating apple:

- The new_head is added to the front of the BODY list.
- Then, if not growing (i.e., not eating), the tail is removed from the body list.

So in initial state: S = [ (1,1) ], Body is empty.

After moving RIGHT once:

new_head = (2,1)
Insert old_head (1,1) at front of empty body → Body becomes [(1,1)]
Since not eating apple, remove last element (body[0] which is 1,1). So after removal, Body is empty.
Thus S becomes [new_head], with no body.

But that's impossible because the snake must have a body. Wait maybe the rule is that when moving without eating, the tail is removed only if there was one to remove. If the snake had multiple segments, it can move; otherwise, perhaps it just moves its head and doesn't follow.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, since the snake starts at (1,1) with no body, moving RIGHT once would be okay because there's no body to collide with. Then from (2,1), the next move can still go RIGHT again unless that leads towards a collision.

But let me think about the path: we need to get to (8,5). The head has to make 7 steps right and 4 steps up? But direction is DOWN initially; wait no—current direction is DOWN. So moving down from (1,1) would be to (1,0), but that's not towards the apple.

Wait hold on: current direction is DOWN, so initial movement options are LEFT or RIGHT because you can't move UP. If I move LEFT from (1,1) to (0,1), which is valid as it's within bounds. But moving LEFT would make x decrease, moving away from 8; that's not helpful.

So better to first move RIGHT multiple times to increase x towards 8.

Let me plan:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Move 2: RIGHT → (3,1)
...
Move 7: RIGHT → (8,1)

But wait the apple is at (8,5). So after moving right all the way to x=8, y remains at 1. Now need to move up.

From (8,1), current direction was RIGHT; movement update will keep direction unless changed by new_head and apple position.

So from (8,1), can I move UP? Because the initial direction is RIGHT, but moving UP would be allowed because it's not reversing direction—UP is separate.

Wait no—the rule says you cannot choose a direction that reverses compared to current. Since the snake was moving RIGHT, you can't now move LEFT as they are opposites, but UP and DOWN aren't opposites of RIGHT.

So from (8,1), directions available: UP or DOWN? Because you were moving RIGHT, so LEFT is forbidden next.

But wait, initial direction is RIGHT; movement rules say that you cannot reverse the last direction. So if last move was RIGHT, can now go RIGHT again, but also other directions except LEFT.

So from (8,1), possible moves: RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

Wait no—the movement update uses current direction to determine next step based on whether it's towards apple.

But perhaps after several moves, the snake has changed its body and thus its effective direction changes. But I'm not sure; maybe I need to model each move carefully.

Alternatively, since moving right multiple times may lead to a long line of body segments behind, making turning easier later.

So let me outline:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Body becomes [(1,1)] → then remove tail → Body is empty. S = [ (2,1) ]

Wait that's not possible because you can't have an empty body after moving when starting with one segment.

Hmm, perhaps in the initial movement:

After moving to (2,1), since there was no apple eaten yet, step 3a inserts old_head (1,1) at front of Body list which was empty → Body becomes [(1,1)]. Then step 3b removes last element because not eating → Body is empty. So S = [ (2,1) ].

That would mean the snake can't move again unless it eats apple or something else. But that's impossible; a snake needs to have at least one body segment beyond head.

Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body list works when moving without eating apple.

Let me check:

Movement Update Rules:
3a: Insert old_head at front of Body → if initial S was [ (1,1) ], then after inserting, Body becomes [(1,1)].
3b: If not growing (i.e., no apple eaten), remove last element from Body. So in this case, since Body had one segment now, removing it leaves empty.

Thus, the new S is [new_head] with empty body. But that's a snake of length 1 again—same as before. That can't be; perhaps my understanding is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe when you insert old_head into the front, if the Body list was empty, then after step 3a, the Body becomes [(old_head)], and since step 3b removes last element only if Body has multiple elements. So in this case, it's one segment; thus, no removal happens.

Wait that might make more sense. So:

If inserting old_head makes Body have only one segment (i.e., len(Body) == 1), then don't remove the tail because there are not enough segments to remove a second last element. Or maybe step 3b only removes if Body has at least two elements.

So in initial movement after step 3a, Body is [(1,1)], and since it's length 1, you can't perform removal; thus S becomes [new_head], which would be (2,1), with Body still as [(1,1)]?

Wait that doesn't make sense because then the snake has a body segment behind. So when moving without eating, does the tail get removed only if possible? Or is the tail always removed unless no growth.

Maybe in this case, since you're not growing, and the Body list was empty before insertion, after inserting old_head, Body becomes [(1,1)], then step 3b tries to remove last element—since Body has length 1, removing it would make it empty. But that's causing a problem because the snake can't have an empty body.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this; maybe in the initial state with no body segments, moving once will result in S being [new_head], and then for each subsequent move without eating, you need to ensure that the Body list has enough elements. Maybe when moving from a single-segment snake, the next move must always allow for growing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed carefully step by step with some simulation.

Let me try to plan a path:

Current position: (1,1), direction: DOWN.
Goal: (8,5).

First move options:
- RIGHT → (2,1)
- LEFT → (0,1) [not helpful]
So best to go RIGHT.

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)

Check for collision: no body segments yet. So proceed.

Insert old_head (1,1) at front of Body list which was empty → Body becomes [(1,1)].
Since not eating apple, remove last element from Body → Body is now empty.

Thus S = [new_head] = (2,1).

Wait but then the snake has no body segments. That can't be right because a snake must have at least one segment beyond head? Or maybe in this case, it's okay as the head moves each time without following any body?

Alternatively, perhaps when moving to (2,1), since there was no tail before, the new body is [(1,1)] and then we try to remove last element but can't because only one exists. So S becomes [new_head] = (2,1) with Body still as [(1,1)], meaning that when you move again, this segment will be considered.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should instead think about the movement without considering the body segments right now and focus on reaching the apple safely.

So from (1,1), to get to (8,5):

Difference in x: 7 steps RIGHT.
Difference in y: +4 steps UP.

Since current direction is DOWN, initial move cannot be UP. So I need to first go RIGHT multiple times to set up a path towards the apple.

Perhaps moving all the way to x=8 first and then turning north (UP) would work.

But let's see:

From (1,1), moving RIGHT 7 times: steps 1-7 → x goes from 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8. So after step 7, position is (8,1).

Now at (8,1), current direction was RIGHT; can now turn UP.

But when you change direction to UP, you have to move to (8,2). Check if that's safe: no body segments except the head and previous positions.

So let's see:

After moving RIGHT 7 times:

Each step involves:
- Moving right
- Inserting old_head into Body
- If not eating apple, removing tail

But each time you insert a new segment behind, so after 7 rights, your body list would be [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (8,1)]. Wait no—each move adds the old head to the front of Body and then removes the last element if not eating.

Wait each time you move right once:

- new_head = current x+1
- insert old_head at front → Body becomes [old_head] + current Body
- remove last element if not growing

So after 7 steps, moving RIGHT each time without eating apple:

Each step i (from 1 to 7):

After step 1:
Body is [(1,1)]
Then since removing tail (only one), Body becomes empty.
S = [2,1]

Wait this seems messy. Maybe it's better to model a few steps.

Alternatively, maybe the first move should be RIGHT to get closer and then manage direction changes.

But perhaps there's another approach: instead of moving all the way right first, try to make some turns early on to avoid being cornered.

For example:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Now direction is RIGHT. Since previous was RIGHT, can now move in any other direction except LEFT.

Move 2: UP → from (2,1) to (2,2). Check for collision with body: no.
Insert old_head (2,1) at front of Body list which after first step became empty? Wait it's getting too complicated again.

Alternatively, maybe moving towards RIGHT and then UP is a better strategy.

Wait another idea: the minimal steps would require moving 7 to the right and 4 up. But since movement can be in any order as long as path doesn't hit itself.

But with direction changes based on current position.

Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT several times until reach x=8, then move UP.
2. Ensure that each step is safe from collision and allows the snake to turn without issue.

Alternatively, another plan: go up once first? But initial direction is DOWN; can't choose UP yet because it's reverse?

Wait no—the current direction is DOWN, but movement update uses current direction to determine next move based on new_head position relative to apple. So if you're moving down and the apple is ahead in your path, you might turn.

But let me think step by step:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
Check for collision? No.
Insert old head into Body front → [(1,1)]
Remove tail since not growing → Body becomes empty. So S = [ (2,1) ]

Move 2: UP → from (2,1) to (2,2). Check if this is safe.

Is there any body segment in the way? No.
Insert old_head (2,1) at front of Body list which was empty → Body becomes [(2,1)].
Since not growing, try to remove last element. But Body has only one element; can't. So S = [new_head] = (2,2), Body is [(2,1)].

So now the snake's body has two segments: head at (2,2) and tail at (2,1). Next move could go forward in same direction or turn.

Move 3: RIGHT → from (2,2) to (3,2)
Check for collision? No.
Insert old_head (2,2) into Body front. Now Body is [(2,2)] + previous Body [(2,1)]. So Body becomes [ (2,2), (2,1) ].

Since not growing, try to remove last element: so Body becomes [ (2,2) ].
S = [3,2]

Wait no—Body after inserting was [ (2,2), (2,1) ], then removing last would make it [ (2,2) ]. So now the snake's body is only [(2,2)], and head at (3,2). But that seems like we lost a segment.

Alternatively, maybe when moving without eating apple, you can't have less than one segment in Body. Hmm.

This approach isn't working; perhaps I need to find another way.

Alternative idea: use the initial movement steps to create a body that allows for turning towards the apple after reaching x=8.

So plan:

1. Move RIGHT until reach (8,y), then move UP.
2. Ensure each step doesn't cause collision and that turns are possible.

Assume we first go all the way right, but let's see what happens when you try to turn up at y=5 or something.

Wait from (8,1) moving UP four times would get us to (8,5). But can the snake make those moves?

Let me think of movement steps:

After reaching (8,1), directions allowed are RIGHT or LEFT now? Or other.

From position (8,1):

Current direction was RIGHT; since you were moving RIGHT last time, cannot move LEFT next. So can move RIGHT again (to 9?), but that's out of bounds. So only options: RIGHT is invalid (x=9 > x_max), so possible moves are UP or DOWN.

But from (8,1), moving DOWN would take you to y=0 which is valid? Wait no—y coordinates in the grid go from 1 at top to higher numbers as they go down. So if apple is at (8,5), then starting position is (1,1). So moving UP increases y.

Wait correction: In coordinate systems, sometimes lower y is up and higher y is down; but here it's current direction DOWN meaning increasing y? Or decreasing?

Wait the problem says "DOWN" direction. If apple is at (8,5) which has a higher y-coordinate than starting point (1,1), then moving UP would be towards lower y or higher y?

This needs clarification.

Assuming that in standard grid terms, moving DOWN increases y. So from (x,y), moving DOWN takes you to (x, y+1). Then to reach apple at (8,5) which is higher than starting point's y=1.

Thus, movement steps needed are:

To move from (1,1) to (8,5):

Delta x = 7 → right 7 times.
Delta y = +4 → up 4 times.

But initial direction is DOWN, so first step can't be UP. So must start by moving RIGHT.

So the plan is to go all the way RIGHT until reach x=8, then turn and move UP four times.

But how will the snake's body help with that?

Wait when you're at (8,y), your body list would have a lot of segments behind you in y-direction. When you start moving UP from there, each step would add to the Body list which is already long.

So let me try:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
No apple eaten; insert old_head = (1,1) into front.
Body becomes [(1,1)].
Remove tail since not growing; Body empty.
S = [2,1]

Wait again, stuck with no body segments. Maybe another approach.

Alternative plan:

Since the snake starts at (1,1), direction DOWN. Instead of moving RIGHT first, perhaps move UP once if possible? But current direction is DOWN, so moving UP would reverse?

No, because you were initially facing DOWN; can't move UP yet as per movement rules—since your last direction was DOWN, next cannot be opposite.

Wait no—if the initial direction was DOWN, and you're at (1,1), but there's an apple at (8,5). So moving DOWN would take you to y=2. But since the apple is ahead in x-direction, perhaps better to move RIGHT.

But let me think if I can turn towards the apple when I have a body segment behind.

Wait for example: after moving several steps right, creating a 'train' of segments that allows turning UP once at (8,y).

Let's outline:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,1)
After movement:
- Insert old_head into Body front → [(1,1)]
- Remove tail because not growing → S = [2,1]

Move 2: RIGHT → (3,1)
Insert (2,1) in front of empty Body.
Body becomes [(2,1)].
Remove tail; S = [3,1]

...

After moving RIGHT seven times:

S would be at (8,1), with Body being a chain from (7,1) to (1,1).

Now, from (8,1):

Can move UP → (8,2)
Check collision: no.
Insert old_head (8,1) into front of Body. Now Body has [(8,1)] + previous Body which was [(7,1), ..., (2,1)]. So Body becomes [ (8,1), 7,1, 6,1 ... 2,1 ].

Since not growing, remove last element → Body becomes [ (8,1), 7,1, ..., 3,1 ]

Now S = [new_head] = (8,2)

From here, can move UP again to (8,3). Check collision: no.
Insert old_head into front of Body. Now Body is [(8,2)] + previousBody without last.

Continue until reach y=5:

Move 4 times UP from (8,2) → reaches (8,6), which is beyond apple's y=5? Wait no—wait the apple is at (8,5).

Wait correction: moving from (8,1):

Each UP move increases y by 1.

So to reach (8,5):

From (8,1):
Move 4 times UP → y becomes 2,3,4,5. So after four moves:

Reach (8,5), which is the apple's position. So total steps:

7 RIGHT + 4 UP = 11 moves.

But in between, need to ensure that each step doesn't cause collision and body segments are managed correctly.

However, during this process, when moving UP from (8,y), the snake has a long body behind it in the y-direction, which could potentially block itself if not careful. But as we're only moving UP once at x=8, perhaps it's manageable.

Wait but after reaching x=8 and moving up four times, does that cause any issue with the existing body?

For example, when you move from (8,1) to (8,2), your Body has a long chain in y-direction. So inserting new_head into front would add another segment at (8,1), making the next step go beyond.

Wait but as we're only moving UP once per x=8 steps, maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps when you reach x=8, turning UP four times is possible without collision because the existing body is in a straight line behind.

I think this might be feasible. So total of 11 moves: 7 RIGHT and 4 UP.

But let me check for any potential collisions:

From (1,1):

- Move RIGHT seven times to reach (8,1). Each move right doesn't collide because no body segments beyond head except in the initial step which is handled by removing tail. So each right move adds a new segment behind and removes last if needed.

At x=8,y=1:

Move UP four times:
Each move checks for collision with any existing body segments.

The existing body includes all previous heads at (7,1) down to (1,1). When moving UP from (8,1), the only existing y-coordinate is 1. So moving up to (8,2) doesn't collide because no segment is there.

Then again same for other ups until reaching (8,5).

So this seems possible.

But then another thought: when moving from (8,1) to (8,2), and adding a new_head at (8,1) into the Body. Then next move UP would go to (8,3). The new_body is [(8,2)] + previousBody without last element.

Wait but in any case, as we're moving up once per x=8 steps, it's possible.

Thus, minimal number of moves seems 7+4=11. But need to confirm whether the snake can turn and move UP after reaching x=8 without colliding with itself.

But considering that when you move from (8,y), your body is in a straight line along y-axis behind you, moving UP doesn't interfere as it's in front of that line.

Therefore, I think this path works. So total moves: 11.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple by first moving RIGHT seven times and then moving UP four times without colliding with its own body segments. This requires a total of 11 moves.

$\boxed{11}$
