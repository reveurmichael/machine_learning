Okay, let's tackle this Snake problem. The head is at (6,9), and the apple is at (8,2). The current direction is UP, and the body is [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. So the snake is moving upwards right now.

First, I need to figure out a path from (6,9) to (8,2) without colliding with the body or the walls. Let's think about the movement steps. Since the snake is currently moving up, the first move can't be down. So the first move options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. But moving up again would take the head to (6,10), which is outside the grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So that's invalid. So the first move can't be UP. So the options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Let me consider moving RIGHT first. If the head moves right to (7,9), then the body would shift. Let's check if that's safe. The body is [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. After moving right, the new head is (7,9). The next body segment would be (6,9) (the old head). Then the rest of the body follows. So the new body would be [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. Wait, but the original body is [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)], so inserting the old head (6,9) at the front. Then, since the new head is not on the apple, the tail (5,6) is removed. So the body becomes [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]. So the body is now [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]. That seems okay. No collision here. So moving right is a possible first step.

Alternatively, moving left would take the head to (5,9). Then the body would be [(5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, when moving left, the new head is (5,9). Then, the body is updated by inserting the old head (6,9) into the front of the body list. The original body is [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. So inserting (6,9) gives [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. Then, since the new head is not on the apple, the tail (5,6) is removed. So the body becomes [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]. That's the same as moving right. So the body is similar in both cases. But the direction is different.

Now, considering the apple is at (8,2), which is to the right and down from the current head. So the snake needs to move right twice (from x=6 to x=8) and down 7 times (from y=9 to y=2). But the snake can't just go straight down because the body is in the way. Let me visualize the snake's body.

The current head is at (6,9), and the body is [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. So the body is a vertical line from (6,9) down to (6,8), (6,7), then left to (5,7), and down to (5,6). So the body is in the columns 6 and 5, rows 9 down to 6. The apple is at (8,2), which is far to the right and down.

So the first step is to move right. Let's do that. Then the head is at (7,9). Next, moving right again to (8,9). Then, we need to move down. But after moving right twice, the body is [(7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]? Wait, no. Let me recheck. After the first move to (7,9), the body would be [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]? No, the body after moving right would be inserting the old head (6,9) into the body list. The original body list was [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. So inserting (6,9) at front gives [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. Then, since the new head is not on the apple, we remove the tail (5,6), so the body becomes [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]. So the body is now [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)].

Now, the head is at (7,9). Next move is right to (8,9). Then the body becomes [(7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]. Then, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8). But need to check if that's safe. Let's see. The new head would be (8,8). The body is [(7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]. So the body cells are (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7). The new head (8,8) is not in any of these, so it's safe. Then, the body would be updated by inserting (8,9) at front, then removing the tail (5,7). So the new body would be [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)].

Continuing down, the snake can move down from (8,8) to (8,7), then (8,6), etc., until it reaches y=2. However, during this movement, the body is moving up, and the head is moving down. Need to ensure that the new head does not collide with any body parts except possibly the tail when it moves.

But wait, when moving down, each step the head moves down, and the body shifts forward. For example, moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), then (8,7), etc. Each time, the body is shifting up. So the body parts are moving up, so the head is moving down, and the body is moving up. So there's no collision as long as the head doesn't go into the body.

But let's think about the path. From (8,9), moving down to (8,8), then (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2). That's 7 steps down. However, during this movement, the body is also moving. Let's check for each step.

After moving to (8,9), the body is [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)]. Then moving down to (8,8): new head is (8,8). The body is [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)]. So inserting the old head (8,9) into the body, then removing the tail (6,7). The new body becomes [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)]. So the body is now [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)]. The head is at (8,8). This is safe.

Next, moving down to (8,7). The new head is (8,7). Check if (8,7) is in the body. The body is [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)]. So no, (8,7) is not there. So safe. Then the body becomes [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)] and then remove tail (6,8) if not eating apple. So the body is [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)].

Continuing this way, each time the head moves down, and the body shifts up. So the head is at (8, y), and the body is moving up. So as long as the head doesn't hit any body parts, it's safe.

But wait, when the snake is moving down, the body parts are moving up. For example, when the head is at (8,8), the body includes (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8). Then, moving down to (8,7), the body becomes [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)]. So the next step, the head is at (8,7), and the body is (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9). So no collision here.

So this seems safe. So the path would be: move right twice to (8,9), then move down seven times to (8,2). However, when the head reaches (8,2), it's on the apple. So that's the target.

But wait, the apple is at (8,2). So the snake needs to reach there. But during the movement, the snake's body is moving up, so when the head is at (8,2), the body is at positions higher up. So that's safe.

But let me check for possible collisions. For example, when the head is moving down, say at (8,5), the body would be (8,6), (8,7), etc. So there's no collision.

Therefore, the steps would be:

1. Right (from (6,9) to (7,9))
2. Right (to (8,9))
3. Down (to (8,8))
4. Down (to (8,7))
5. Down (to (8,6))
6. Down (to (8,5))
7. Down (to (8,4))
8. Down (to (8,3))
9. Down (to (8,2)).

That's 9 steps in total. But need to check each step for collision. However, since the body is moving up, and the head is moving down, there's no collision. So this seems possible.

But what about when the snake is moving down, the body parts are moving up. For example, after the first two right moves, the body is [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)]? Wait, earlier steps: after moving right twice, the head is at (8,9), and the body is [(7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]? Wait, I think I need to recheck the body after each move.

Let me go step by step again:

Initial position:

Head: (6,9)
Body: [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]

Move 1: Right to (7,9)
New head: (7,9)
Body after inserting old head (6,9) into body list: [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]
Since new head is not on apple, remove tail (5,6). New body: [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]

Move 2: Right to (8,9)
New head: (8,9)
Insert old head (7,9) into body list: [(7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]
Remove tail (5,7). New body: [(7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)]

Move 3: Down to (8,8)
New head: (8,8)
Insert old head (8,9) into body list: [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)]
Remove tail (6,7). New body: [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)]

Move 4: Down to (8,7)
New head: (8,7)
Insert old head (8,8) into body list: [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)]
Remove tail (6,8). New body: [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)]

Move 5: Down to (8,6)
New head: (8,6)
Insert old head (8,7) into body list: [(8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)]
Remove tail (6,9). New body: [(8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9)]

Move 6: Down to (8,5)
New head: (8,5)
Insert old head (8,6) into body list: [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9)]
Remove tail (7,9). New body: [(8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9)]

Move 7: Down to (8,4)
New head: (8,4)
Insert old head (8,5) into body list: [(8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9)]
Remove tail (8,9). New body: [(8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]

Move 8: Down to (8,3)
New head: (8,3)
Insert old head (8,4) into body list: [(8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]
Remove tail (8,8). New body: [(8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)]

Move 9: Down to (8,2)
New head: (8,2)
Insert old head (8,3) into body list: [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)]
Remove tail (8,7). New body: [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)]

At this point, the head is at (8,2), which is the apple. So the snake has reached the target.

This seems to work. So the sequence of moves is:

Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down, Down, Down, Down.

But let me check if any of these steps would cause a collision. For example, when moving down from (8,9) to (8,8), the body is [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)]. The new head (8,8) is not in the body. Then, when moving down to (8,7), the body is [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)]. The new head (8,7) is not in the body. Similarly, each subsequent step, the head is at (8,y), and the body is moving up, so there's no collision. So this path is safe.

Alternatively, what if the snake moves left first? Let's see. Moving left to (5,9), then the body is [(5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]? No, after moving left to (5,9), the body becomes [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)] with the new head inserted. Wait, original body is [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]. Inserting the old head (6,9) gives [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)], then remove tail (5,6). So body is [(6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]. So same as moving right. Then, moving left again would take the head to (4,9), but that's not helpful. So moving right seems better.

Another thing to consider: when the snake is moving down, the body is moving up. So the body parts are no longer in the way of the head. So this path is safe.

Therefore, the sequence of moves would be:

Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down, Down, Down, Down.

But that's 9 steps. However, the problem doesn't specify the number of steps, just to provide a correct path.

But let me check if there's a shorter path. For example, after moving right twice, can the snake move diagonally? No, the snake can only move in four directions (assuming standard movement). So each step is one direction.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different path that avoids some steps. But given the body's position, the path I outlined seems safe.

Another possible issue: when the head is moving down, the body may have segments that are in the same column. For example, when the head is at (8,8), the body includes (8,9), which is directly above. But since the head is moving down, and the body is moving up, there's no collision.

So this path should work. Therefore, the answer would be a sequence of moves: right, right, then down seven times. So the moves are: RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.
</think>

To navigate the snake from its initial position at (6,9) to the target location at (8,2) without colliding with its body or the grid boundaries, we must consider the following:

---

### **Initial Setup**

- **Snake's head**: (6,9)
- **Body**: [(6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6)]
- **Target**: (8,2)

---

### **Movement Strategy**

The snake must move in a way that avoids its own body and stays within the grid. The most direct and safe path is:

1. **Move Right** twice to reach (8,9), which allows the snake to avoid its body that lies in the same column (6,9 to 6,8).
2. **Move Down** seven times from (8,9) to (8,2), which is the target. As the snake moves down, its body moves up, ensuring no collision with the head.

---

### **Step-by-Step Path**

| Step | Direction | New Position |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1    | Right     | (7,9)        |
| 2    | Right     | (8,9)        |
| 3    | Down      | (8,8)        |
| 4    | Down      | (8,7)        |
| 5    | Down      | (8,6)        |
| 6    | Down      | (8,5)        |
| 7    | Down      | (8,4)        |
| 8    | Down      | (8,3)        |
| 9    | Down      | (8,2)        |

---

### **Conclusion**

This path ensures that the snake reaches the target without colliding with its own body or the grid boundaries. It is both optimal and safe, requiring **9 moves** in total.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\text{RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN}}
$$
