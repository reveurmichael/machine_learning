<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. The snake is at (2,6), and the apple is at (3,5). So, I need to find a path that gets the head from (2,6) to (3,5) without causing any collisions with the body or walls.

First, looking at the current direction, it's "UP". So, if I choose a direction that reverses this, like "DOWN", that would be invalid. But since I can't reverse, my first move must not be "DOWN".

The head is currently at (2,6). The apple is to the right and down by one unit each. Wait, no, let me check: from (2,6) to (3,5), x increases by 1 and y decreases by 1. So, that's a diagonal move in terms of direction changes.

But since I can only change direction in certain ways, I need to plan the moves carefully.

Looking at the body cells: [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]. So, these are the segments behind the head. The tail is at (2,1).

So, if I move right to (3,6) first, that might be a good idea because it's directly towards the apple's x-coordinate. But wait, moving right would require checking for collisions.

Wait, let me think about possible paths:

Option 1: Move RIGHT then DOWN.
But from (2,6), moving RIGHT takes us to (3,6). Then, moving DOWN would take us to (3,5) which is the apple's position. But I need to check if these moves are safe.

First move: current direction is UP. So, I can't choose DOWN as the first move because that would reverse. Wait, no—the initial direction is "UP", so the next move cannot be "DOWN". Because of rule 2 in movement rules: cannot reverse on the first move? Or is it any move after?

Wait, looking back: Movement Rules point 2 says cannot reverse if current direction is "UP" and you choose "DOWN" next. So, since the initial direction is UP, I can't choose DOWN as the next move.

So, my first move must be either LEFT or RIGHT because those aren't reversing from UP. Or maybe I can turn in another way.

Wait, movement directions: if current direction is UP, I cannot choose DOWN next. Other directions are allowed. So for the first move, since current direction is UP, I can choose UP, LEFT, RIGHT—wait no, "UP" again would be moving straight, but according to the rules, it's allowed because reversing is only when going opposite.

Wait, movement rule 2: cannot reverse. If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next. So, first move must not be DOWN. It can be any other direction except for DOWN.

So, initial options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let me consider each possibility.

Option A: Move UP first to (2,7). Then, from there, perhaps move RIGHT to reach the apple.

But wait, after moving UP, the body will shift. So, I need to make sure that in each step, the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail's current position when it moves.

Alternatively, Option B: Move RIGHT first to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5). But I have to ensure that moving RIGHT is safe and then moving DOWN is also safe.

Let me check for collisions:

Current head is at (2,6).

If I move RIGHT to (3,6):

Check if (3,6) is in the body. The body cells are [(2,5), (2,4), ..., (2,1)]. So, no collision except perhaps with the tail.

Wait, when moving, after inserting the old head into the body, the new body would be [old_head] + current_body, and then we either remove the tail or not. But in this case, if I move to (3,6), which is not the apple's position, so the body will shift normally.

Wait, but let me check: when moving from (2,6) to (3,6):

- new_head is (3,6). Is this cell occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail?

The current body cells are [(2,5), (2,4), ..., (2,1)]. So, no collision here.

So, after moving RIGHT, the head becomes (3,6), and the body segments become [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), ... , (1,1), (2,1) ] but then we remove the tail if not eating an apple. But since (3,6) is not the apple's position, we proceed to remove the tail.

Wait, the apple is at (3,5). So, first move: RIGHT to (3,6).

Next, need to get down to (3,5). The next direction would be DOWN.

But wait, after moving RIGHT, our current direction is RIGHT. Can I then choose DOWN?

Yes, because from RIGHT, the reverse is LEFT, so as long as I'm not choosing LEFT, it's allowed.

So, second move: DOWN to (3,5), which is the apple's position.

Now, when moving DOWN, we have to check collisions again:

- new_head is (3,5). Is this cell in the body? The body after first move would be [ (2,6) ] + original body except tail. Wait no: let me clarify.

After first move (RIGHT):

Old head was at (2,6), moving to (3,6).

The body before movement was [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4), ... , (2,1)].

Inserting the old head into the body list makes it [ (2,6) ] followed by the original body. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (which is (2,1)), so the new body becomes [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1) ].

So, when moving DOWN to (3,5):

Check if (3,5) is in the body. The body cells are now as above: none of them are at (3,5). So it's safe.

But wait, does the tail move after this? If we eat the apple, which we do because new_head == apple position, so we don't remove the tail.

Wait, in the movement update rule:

If new_head is apple, grow: don't remove tail. So in the second step, when moving to (3,5), since that's where the apple is, the body grows by one segment.

So, after eating the apple, the body becomes [ (2,6) ] + current body before movement, which was [(2,5), ... , (1,1)], so new body would be [ (3,6) from first move? Wait no:

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to model each step.

Initial state:

Head: (2,6)
Body cells: [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]
Direction: UP

First move: RIGHT.

Compute new_head = 2+1=3, 6. So (3,6).

Check collision:

- (3,6) is within bounds.
- Is it in the body? The body cells are [(2,5), ...], so no. Safe.

Update body:

Insert old head (2,6) into front of body: new body becomes [ (2,6) ] + [ (2,5), ..., (2,1) ]

Since we didn't eat apple (apple is at (3,5)), we remove the tail (which is (2,1)).

So new body after first move:

[ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1) ]

Head is now at (3,6).

Next move: DOWN to (3,5).

Compute new_head = 3, 6-1=5. So (3,5) which is the apple.

Check collision:

Is (3,5) in body? The current body after first move doesn't include it.

So safe.

Update body:

Insert old head (3,6) into front: [ (3,6), (2,6), ... , (1,1) ]

Since new_head is apple, we don't remove tail. So body becomes:

[ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1) ]

Head is now at (3,5).

So after two moves: RIGHT then DOWN.

Wait, but the problem says that when the snake eats an apple, it must ensure there's at least one legal move next turn. So after eating the apple, can we make a move?

But in this case, after moving to (3,5), which is the apple, the body has grown. Now, let's see if any direction would cause collision.

The head is at (3,5). The body segments are:

[ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), ... , (1,1) ]

So, in terms of surrounding cells:

Looking around (3,5):

Left: (2,5) is part of the body.

Right: (4,5): empty?

Up: (3,6) is part of the body.

Down: (3,4). Is that part of the body? Looking at the body segments after first move, we have (2,4), but not (3,4). So down to (3,4) would be safe.

But wait, in the second step, when moving to (3,5), which is the apple's position, so the next step is a third move? Or do I only need two moves?

Wait, no. The problem requires that after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move possible for the snake. So in our case, after eating at (3,5), can we make any move without colliding.

Looking around:

From (3,5):

Possible directions: UP is (3,6) which is part of body; LEFT is (2,5) also part of body; RIGHT is (4,5)—empty? And DOWN is (3,4)—empty?

Wait, but in the body after eating, it's [ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), ..., (1,1) ].

So, moving RIGHT to (4,5): Is that safe?

Yes, because none of the current body segments are at (4,5).

Similarly, moving DOWN to (3,4) is also safe.

But since we have two possible directions, it's fine. So the path is valid.

Thus, the moves would be RIGHT then DOWN.

Wait, but initially, the direction was UP. So first move can't be DOWN because that would reverse. Wait no: the initial direction is UP; so for the first move, I cannot choose DOWN. But in our plan, the first move is RIGHT, which is allowed.

Then, after moving RIGHT, the direction becomes RIGHT. Then, from there, choosing DOWN is allowed as it's not reversing (from RIGHT to DOWN is allowed).

So yes, this path should work.

Another consideration: Are there any other possible collisions or issues?

After first move to (3,6), body includes (2,6). So when moving down from (3,6) to (3,5), the cell below isn't blocked except by the tail which moves.

Wait, no, in movement update rule, when you move, you insert the old head into the body, and then remove the tail if not eating an apple.

So after first move:

Body becomes [ (2,6) ] + original body excluding tail.

Original body was 9 cells: [(2,5), (2,4), ..., (2,1)].

After inserting head, it's 10 cells: [ (2,6), ... , (2,1) ], then remove the tail (which is (2,1)), so now 9 again.

Then second move to (3,5):

Insert old head (3,6), body becomes [ (3,6), (2,6), ..., (1,1) ] and since we eat apple, don't remove tail.

So body is now 10 cells.

So, no collision in the second step.

Thus, this path should work: RIGHT then DOWN.

Alternatively, could there be another path?

Another option: First move UP to (2,7), then move RIGHT to (3,7), but that seems like it's going away from the apple. Probably not efficient.

Alternatively, first move LEFT to (1,6). But that might complicate things because moving left might make it harder to reach the apple without hitting body segments.

So, perhaps the most straightforward path is RIGHT then DOWN.

Thus, the moves are: RIGHT, DOWN.

Wait, but in terms of steps:

First step: from (2,6) to (3,6).

Second step: from (3,6) to (3,5). So two moves.

But wait, perhaps I should check if there's any other collision when moving right then down.

After first move, the body includes (2,6), but when moving down from (3,6) to (3,5):

Is (3,5) in the new body?

The new body after first move is [ (2,6), (2,5), ..., (1,1) ].

So, no, (3,5) isn't in that list. So it's safe.

Therefore, this plan should work.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate the snake from its current head position at (2, 6) to the target apple located at (3, 5) without causing any collisions with its body segments or walls. The initial direction of the snake is upwards ("UP"), and we must adhere to movement rules that prevent reversing directions immediately.

### Approach
1. **Initial Analysis**: The snake starts at position (2, 6) moving upwards. The target is at (3, 5), which requires a move to the right and then downwards.
2. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction on the first move. Therefore, from an initial upward direction, it can move left, right, or continue upwards but not directly down.
3. **Path Planning**:
   - **First Move**: Moving right to (3, 6). This is safe as it doesn't collide with any body segments and moves towards the target's x-coordinate.
   - **Second Move**: From (3, 6), moving down to (3, 5). This move is also safe as it reaches the target without colliding with any body segments.

### Solution Code
```python
# The solution involves two moves: RIGHT then DOWN

moves = ["RIGHT", "DOWN"]
```

### Explanation
1. **First Move**: Moving right from (2, 6) to (3, 6) is safe and aligns the snake's head towards the target's x-coordinate.
2. **Second Move**: From (3, 6), moving down to (3, 5) safely reaches the apple without colliding with any body segments.

This approach ensures that the snake reaches the target in two moves while adhering to all constraints and avoiding collisions.
