========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (6,6) to eat the apple at (5,6). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (6,6), and the body cells are [(6,7), (5,7)]. So the body starts right behind the head. The direction is currently "DOWN". But I remember that after moving, I can't reverse my direction immediately. Since the current direction is "DOWN", the next move can't be "UP".

Wait, no, according to the rules, you can't reverse directions on the first move. So if the current direction is "NONE" (which it's not here), any direction is allowed. But since the current direction is "DOWN", I can choose any direction except "UP" for my next move.

So from (6,6) heading down, what are the options? Let me think about possible moves without causing immediate collisions.

First, looking at the apple position: it's at (5,6). That's one unit to the left of the head. So ideally, moving "LEFT" would get me there directly, but I need to check if that's safe.

But wait, where is the body? The body cells are [(6,7), (5,7)]. So after the head, the next part is at (6,7) which is up one from the head. Then (5,7), which is left one and up two from the head.

If I move "LEFT" from (6,6), the new head would be (5,6). Now, I need to check if this causes a collision with any body cells except possibly the tail when it moves.

The body after moving would have the old head at (6,6) inserted into the front of the body list. So the new body list before checking for collisions would be [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]. The apple is at (5,6), which is not part of the body except perhaps if the tail was about to move.

Wait, the collision check says that new_head can't coincide with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So in this case, the tail is at (5,7). When we eat the apple, the body grows, so the tail doesn't move. But if I'm moving towards (5,6), which is adjacent to (5,7) but not currently part of the body except for the next step.

Wait, let me clarify: when computing new_head, the body hasn't moved yet. So before any update, the body is [(6,7), (5,7)]. The new head is at (5,6). Now, does this new_head collide with any BODYi?BODYi includes (6,7) and (5,7). Since (5,6) is not in those, it's safe.

But wait, after moving, the body will be updated. Let me go through the movement steps:

1. Compute new_head: (5,6).
2. Check collision: (5,6) isn't in the body [(6,7), (5,7)], so no collision.
3. Update body:
   a. Insert old head (6,6) at front → body becomes [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)].
   b. Since new_head == apple position, we grow: don't remove the tail. So body becomes [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7), ...] but wait, no—after inserting old head, the body is now [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]. Then since it's eating apple, we add new_head without removing tail.

Wait, no. Let me recheck the update steps:

After moving, in step 3a, insert old head into the front of the BODY list. So the body becomes [ (6,6) ] + current_body → [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)].

Then, since new_head == apple position, we don't remove tail. So the body length increases by 1. Wait no: in step 3b, if eating apple, we do not remove the tail. So after inserting old head at front, the body is [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]. Then, since it's an apple, we don't remove tail. But wait, the tail was already part of the body.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again:

Original body list after step 3a: [old_head] + current_body → [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

Then, if new_head == apple, we don't remove tail. So the new body becomes [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ] and the head is now at (5,6). So the full snake would be [(5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)].

Wait, no—head is updated after all steps. The body list in step 3a becomes [old_head] + current_body → [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

Then, since it's an apple, we don't remove the tail, so the body stays as [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ]. The head is updated to (5,6). So the full snake is [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

But wait, that's a problem because from (5,6) to (6,6) is one step right, then up, etc. But each segment must be adjacent by Manhattan distance 1. Let me check:

(5,6) → (6,6): yes, they are adjacent.
(6,6) → (6,7): adjacent.
(6,7) → (5,7): adjacent.

So the body remains continuous. That's good.

But what about after this move? The snake has grown by one segment because it ate the apple. So the body is now longer.

Now, I need to make sure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move next turn. Because if the apple is eaten and the snake is in a position where all possible moves are blocked, it dies immediately.

In this case, after moving left to (5,6), what options do I have for the next move?

The current direction was "DOWN", but since I just moved "LEFT", which is allowed because from "DOWN" you can't go "UP". Wait no: the current direction in input is "DOWN", so my previous move must not be reverse. So when moving, I can't choose the opposite direction of the current direction.

Wait, the movement rules say that you cannot reverse directions on the first move. Oh wait, no: rule 2 says you cannot reverse the direction if it's already set. So if current direction is "DOWN", next move can't be "UP". But in this case, the initial direction given is "DOWN", so my next move can't be "UP".

So when I'm moving from (6,6) to (5,6), that's a "LEFT" move. Then, after eating the apple, my new head is at (5,6). The current direction would now be "LEFT". So for the next move, I can't choose "RIGHT" because that's the reverse.

Wait, no: after moving "LEFT", the new direction becomes "LEFT". So on the next step, I can't choose "RIGHT".

But in this case, after eating the apple, the snake is at (5,6), and the body is [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

Wait no: after moving, the head is (5,6), and the body is [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ]. So the snake's full segments are [(5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)].

Now, for the next move, what options do I have? Let me see:

I can't choose "RIGHT" because that's the reverse of "LEFT". So possible moves: "UP", "DOWN".

Looking at (5,6):

- UP would take it to (5,7). But looking at the body segments, after moving, new_head is (5,7). The body before update is [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]. So the new head would be at (5,7) which is part of the body. That's a collision because it's not the tail.

Wait, the current body after moving to (5,6) is [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ]. The tail is at (5,7). So if I choose "UP", new_head would be (5,7), which is the tail. But in collision check, new_head can't coincide with any BODYi except when it's the tail and that tail will move.

Wait, no: the collision check is done using the state before body shifts. So the body before the update is [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

If I choose "UP", new_head is (5,7). Now, checking if this coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move.

The tail is at (5,7). So new_head would be moving into the tail. But since the body will shift, the tail will vacate (5,7) and become part of the body. So in this case, is it allowed?

Wait, according to the collision rule: If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

So in this case, if I choose "UP", new_head is (5,7), which is the current tail. But since the tail will move when the body shifts, it's allowed?

Wait no: because before the update, the tail is at (5,7). So when checking collision, we see that new_head is (5,7) which is part of the BODYi list [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ]. Therefore, it would collide.

So moving "UP" from (5,6) is not allowed because new_head coincides with a body segment.

What about "DOWN"? Moving "DOWN" from (5,6) would take to (5,5). Let's check collision: none of the body segments are at (5,5), so it's safe.

After moving "DOWN", the head is at (5,5), and the body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ] inserted into the front. Wait no: step 3a says insert old head at front of the body list. So after moving down:

1. New_head is (5,5).
2. Check collision: none.
3. Update body:
   a. Insert old_head (5,6) → new body list becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].
4. Since it's not an apple move, we remove the tail. So the body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].

Wait no: in this case, after moving "DOWN" from (5,6), which is a normal move (not eating apple), so step 3b would just be to remove the tail, making the body length same as before. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, when moving and not eating an apple, the body updates by inserting old head at front and then removing the last segment (the tail). So in this case:

Old body after step 3a: [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

Then, since new_head is not equal to apple, we remove the last element. Wait no: I think when moving and not eating, you just keep the same length by inserting old head and removing tail.

So after moving "DOWN":

1. Compute new_head: (5,5).
2. Check collision: none.
3. Insert old head (5,6) into front → body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].
4. Since it's not an apple move, remove the tail → body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].

So the snake is now [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].

Wait no: after inserting old head at front, the body is [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ], and then remove tail → [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].

So the full snake is [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)]?

Wait no: I think I'm misunderstanding. The body list in step 3a is inserted into the front of the current body. So after moving to (5,5):

- Insert old head (5,6) → body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

But since we're not eating an apple, in step 3b, we remove the tail. So the new body is [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].

Wait, but that would mean the snake's segments are now [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ], since after inserting and then removing tail?

No, I think it's more like:

After moving "DOWN", the new head is at (5,5). The old body was [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

So step 3a: insert old_head into front → [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ] becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ].

Step 3b: since not eating apple, remove the last segment → [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ].

So the full snake is [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ]? Or wait, no. The head is updated after all steps, so the new body list becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,7) ], and the head is at (5,5). So the segments are [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)].

But wait, that's four segments: head + 3 body parts. But initially, after eating apple, we had three body parts plus the new head. Hmm, maybe I'm getting too deep into it.

The key point is that after moving "DOWN" from (5,6), the next move can be done without collision. So in this scenario, moving directly left to eat the apple seems possible, but what happens next?

Wait, perhaps a better approach: let me consider alternative moves.

Since the current direction is "DOWN", and I can't choose "UP" as next move.

If I instead choose to move "LEFT", which is allowed because it's not opposite of "DOWN".

So from (6,6), moving left to (5,6) directly eats the apple. That seems efficient.

But then, after that, in the next turn, I have direction set to "LEFT". So my next possible moves can't be "RIGHT" (the reverse).

Looking at position (5,6):

Possible moves: "UP", "DOWN", and "LEFT".

Wait, but if the snake is now [(5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)], then moving "UP" from (5,6) would take to (5,7), which is part of the body. So collision occurs.

Similarly, moving "DOWN" to (5,5): no collision.

So after eating apple at (5,6), the next move could be "DOWN".

But I'm not sure if that's necessary because the problem only asks for how to eat the apple, but perhaps just moving left is sufficient.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let me think about all possible initial moves.

From (6,6) with direction "DOWN":

Possible next moves are any except "UP".

So options: "LEFT", "RIGHT", "DOWN".

Moving "LEFT" directly to apple.

Moving "RIGHT": new head at (7,6). Check collision: body is [(6,7), (5,7)]. So no collision. Then, after moving right, the body would be [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ] inserted into front → [ (6,6), (6,7), (5,7) ]. But since it's not apple, remove tail. New body is [ (6,6), (6,7) ].

But then to get to the apple, I'd have to move "LEFT" twice? Not sure if that's more efficient.

Alternatively, moving "DOWN": from (6,6) to (6,5). But the apple is at (5,6), so that would require additional steps.

So the most direct path is to move "LEFT".

Thus, the answer should be to move "LEFT" directly into the apple.
</think>

To eat the apple located at position (5, 6) while avoiding collisions and adhering to movement rules:

1. **Current Position**: The snake's head is at (6, 6), moving downward ("DOWN").
2. **Allowed Moves**: Since the current direction is "DOWN", the next move cannot be "UP".
3. **Optimal Move**: Moving "LEFT" directly takes the head from (6, 6) to (5, 6), where the apple is located.
4. **Collision Check**: The new position (5, 6) does not collide with any existing body segments except potentially the tail. However, since it's an apple move, the tail doesn't shift, allowing a safe collision only at the tail which will vacate its spot.

**Answer:** Move LEFT into the apple.
