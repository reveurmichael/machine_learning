========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake eat the apple at (7,6) without dying. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.

The snake's head is at (6,6), and it's currently moving UP. The body cells are [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. So, the snake is a vertical line extending from (6,6) down to (6,2). The apple is just one cell to the right of the head at (7,6).

First, I need to consider the direction rules. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN because that would reverse direction. So the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or staying in UP.

Looking at the apple's position, it's directly to the right of the head. So moving RIGHT seems like a straightforward path. Let me check if there are any obstacles in that path.

If I move RIGHT from (6,6), the new head would be at (7,6). Now, I need to ensure that this new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it moves.

Looking at the body cells: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. None of these are at (7,6), so moving RIGHT is safe in terms of collision. Also, since this move would take the head to the apple's position, the snake will grow by one segment, meaning the tail won't be removed this turn.

So after moving RIGHT, the body will add the old head (6,6) at the front, making the new body list [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. Since we ate the apple, the tail doesn't move, so the length increases by one. Now the snake's body is longer, but the new head is safely at (7,6) with no collision.

I also need to ensure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move next turn. Right now, the new head is at (7,6). The possible directions would be UP or DOWN because we just moved RIGHT. Wait, but what was the previous direction? Oh right, the current direction is UP, so when moving RIGHT, that changes the direction to RIGHT for the next move.

Wait noâ€”the movement direction changes based on the chosen move. So after moving RIGHT, the new direction will be RIGHT. But in this case, since the apple is eaten, the next move needs to ensure we don't get stuck. However, after eating, the snake's body has grown, so I need to check if any adjacent cells are blocked.

But in this specific case, since the apple was just one cell away, moving RIGHT directly gets us there without any issues. There's no immediate collision, and the path is clear.

I think moving RIGHT is the best choice here because it's direct and avoids any potential obstacles. The snake can grow by eating the apple, and as long as we don't reverse direction immediately, which isn't a concern here since the next move would be after eating, but that's handled by the movement rules.
