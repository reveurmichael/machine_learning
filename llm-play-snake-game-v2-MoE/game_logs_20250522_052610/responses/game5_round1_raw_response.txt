========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (5,2). Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the current state: the head is at (5,5), and the apple is directly below at (5,2). So the y-coordinate needs to decrease by 3. Since movement in the grid affects both x and y coordinates based on direction vectors, I need to plan a path that moves the snake downward without causing it to collide with its own body or go out of bounds.

The current direction is NONE, which means any initial move is allowed. But after the first move, I can't reverse direction. So if I start by moving DOWN, the next move can't be UP.

Since the apple is directly below, the most straightforward path would be to move DOWN three times: from (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (5,2). But wait, the body cells are empty, so initially, there's no body in the way. So maybe this is possible.

But I also need to consider that after eating the apple, the tail doesn't shrink immediately. That means if the snake eats the apple at (5,2), it will add a segment to its body. But since the body was empty before, the next move after eating would have to be safe. However, in this case, moving DOWN three times is straightforward.

Wait, but I should also think about possible collisions. Since the initial body is empty, there's no risk from that. So moving DOWN, DOWN, DOWN seems like a direct path.

Another thought: Maybe the snake could take a different route if it had to avoid something, but in this case, since the apple is directly below and the grid is clear, moving straight down is safe.

I should also check the direction constraints. Starting from NONE allows any first move. So choosing DOWN as the initial move is fine. The second move can't be UP because that would reverse direction, so I'd have to continue DOWN or turn LEFT/RIGHT. But since the apple is directly below, continuing down makes sense.

So the sequence would be three DOWN moves: ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"].

Wait, but let me confirm the movement logic. Each move updates the head and then adds it to the body (except when eating the apple). Since the apple is at (5,2), after moving there, the snake grows by one segment. So in this case, since we start with an empty body, each move adds a new segment but doesn't remove any until the apple isn't eaten. Wait no: according to the rules, when the apple is eaten, the tail doesn't shrink on the next move. Hmm, so perhaps I need to make sure that after eating, there's still at least one legal move.

But in this case, since the path is three moves, and after the third move (eating the apple), the body would have grown by one segment each time except for the last step because we ate the apple. Wait no: Each move adds a new head, but when eating an apple, the tail isn't removed, so the length increases by one.

Wait, the snake starts with just the head at (5,5). The body cells are empty, meaning the snake is only the head. So after moving DOWN to (5,4), the body becomes [(5,5)]. Then moving again DOWN to (5,3), the body becomes [(5,5), (5,4)], and so on until reaching (5,2). At that point, since we ate the apple, the tail isn't removed, so the snake's length is 4 segments. But after eating, does it matter? Because the next move would be from (5,2) with a new direction.

Wait, no: once the apple is eaten at step three, the moves list ends because the objective is achieved. So I think the reasoning holdsâ€”three DOWN moves should suffice.

I don't see any immediate obstacles here since there's nothing else on the grid except the head and the apple. Therefore, moving straight down is the most efficient and safe path.
