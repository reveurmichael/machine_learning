========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to move the snake from (7,5) to eat the apple at (2,0). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (7,5), and the body cells are [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. So the snake is currently moving in a straight line to the left. The direction is "RIGHT", which seems odd because from (7,5) moving right would take it further away from the apple at (2,0). Wait, no—the current direction is "RIGHT". That means the head was just moved to the right, and the body follows behind.

The apple is at (2,0), which is quite a distance to the left and down. The snake needs to move west and south. But since it's currently moving right, the first move can't be left because that would reverse direction. Wait, no—can the snake change direction immediately? No, the movement rules state that you cannot reverse direction on the first move if the current direction is not NONE. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.

Wait, but according to the movement rules: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So since current direction is "RIGHT", the next move cannot be "LEFT".

So from (7,5) moving in RIGHT direction, the next possible moves are UP or DOWN. But wait, no—if current direction is RIGHT, can't choose LEFT on the first move. Wait, actually, movement rules say you cannot reverse direction, but if current direction is NONE, any first move is allowed. In this case, current direction is RIGHT, so the next direction must not be LEFT.

So possible moves are UP or DOWN. Let me see: moving UP from (7,5) would take the head to (7,6). Moving DOWN would take it to (7,4).

The apple is at (2,0), which is much lower and to the left. So perhaps a southward approach would be better.

But let's visualize the grid:

Grid:
(0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) top-right. So y increases upwards.

Current head: (7,5). Apple at (2,0), which is far left and near the bottom.

Snake body behind head is moving to the left as well—so from (6,5) to (4,5). That means the tail is currently at (4,5).

So if I move the snake UP or DOWN first, but I can't move LEFT because that's reversing.

Let me think about possible paths. Since I'm starting at (7,5), and need to get to (2,0), which requires moving left 5 times and down 5 times, net movement is left 5 and down 5.

But the current direction is RIGHT, so first move can't be LEFT. So perhaps start by turning DOWN or UP.

Wait, if I move DOWN first, then next moves could involve moving more to the south and west.

Alternatively, since the apple is directly south of the head (from y=5 to y=0), maybe moving down as much as possible would help.

But let's see: from (7,5) moving DOWN each time until I reach y=0. But that's 5 moves down. Then, once at y=0, I can move left to x=2.

However, the snake is currently in a straight line moving right, so if I change direction to DOWN, it might be possible to navigate south without hitting the body.

Wait, but when you turn, the body follows. So after turning DOWN, each subsequent segment will adjust accordingly.

But let's map out the initial moves step by step.

First move: from (7,5) moving DOWN would take head to (7,4). Then, check if this new head is safe.

The body cells are [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. So after moving down, the new head is at (7,4). The body cells after this move will be [old_head=(7,5), then 6,5; 5,5; 4,5]. But before updating, we need to check for collision. New head is (7,4). Does it collide with any of the body except possibly the tail?

The body cells are behind the head: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So the new head (7,4) is not in these positions, so no collision.

So first move can be DOWN to (7,4).

Next move: what's possible? Since previous direction was RIGHT, current direction after moving DOWN becomes "DOWN". Next moves cannot reverse—so can't go UP. Possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT again, but considering the new position.

Wait, no—the movement is based on the new direction chosen each time. So once you choose a direction, the next move must not be the opposite unless it's NONE.

So after first move DOWN, current direction is "DOWN". Next moves cannot be UP.

But let me think: from (7,4), what can I do?

I need to get to (2,0). So perhaps moving left and then down again.

Wait, but the body is now [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] because when you move DOWN, the old head becomes part of the body. Wait no—body list is updated by inserting the old head at front, then removing tail unless eating apple.

Wait, initial body after moving DOWN would be:

Old head was (7,5). New head is (7,4).

Body cells were [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. After moving, insert old head at front: new body list becomes [ (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]. Then, since we're not eating an apple (apple is at (2,0)), remove the tail (4,5). So the new body is [ (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) ].

So after first move: head is (7,4), body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)].

Now, from (7,4), possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT, but not UP. Let's see:

If I move LEFT to (6,4): new_head = (6,4). Check collision with body except tail.

The body after first move is [ (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) ]. The new head (6,4) is not in these positions. So safe.

After moving LEFT, the old head becomes part of the body. New body list:

Insert (7,4) at front: [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Then remove tail (5,5). So new body is [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5) ].

So now head is (6,4), body is [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5)].

Next move: current direction is LEFT. Next possible moves cannot be RIGHT.

From (6,4), to reach apple at (2,0), need to go further left and down.

If I continue moving LEFT:

New head would be (5,4). Check collision with body except tail.

Body is [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5) ]. The new head (5,4) is not in these positions. So safe.

Proceeding: after second move (LEFT to 5,4):

Insert old head (6,4) at front of body. Then remove tail unless eating apple.

Body becomes [ (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5) ] → then remove tail (6,5). So new body is [ (6,4), (7,4), (7,5) ].

So now head is at (5,4).

Continue this way:

Third move: LEFT to 4,4. Check collision with body [(6,4), (7,4), (7,5)]. New head (4,4) not in these positions.

After moving, insert old head (5,4). Remove tail (7,5). Body becomes [ (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) ].

Now at 4,4. Next move can't be RIGHT because current direction is LEFT.

But I need to get further down towards y=0. So perhaps change direction to DOWN now.

Wait, but after moving from 5,4 to 4,4 in LEFT direction, the next possible directions are UP or DOWN (since previous direction was LEFT).

So choose DOWN: new head (4,3). Check collision with body [ (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) ]. No collision.

Proceeding:

After moving DOWN from 4,4 to 4,3. Insert old head (4,4) into body: [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) ], then remove tail (7,4). So new body is [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) ].

Now head at 4,3. Next move can't be UP.

From here, I need to continue moving down towards y=0.

So next direction: DOWN again. New head would be 4,2. Check collision with body [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) ]. No collision.

Proceeding:

After moving DOWN, insert old head into body, remove tail unless eating apple.

Continuing this way, I can move down step by step until y=0.

Once at y=0, then start moving left towards x=2.

But let's see if there are any obstacles. As the snake moves down, the body is following, so as long as we don't hit our own body.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to move in a different path to avoid hitting the body.

Wait, but each time we change direction, the body adjusts accordingly. So perhaps a spiral or some pattern would help, but given that the apple is straight left and down, perhaps moving directly south then west is best.

But let me outline the steps:

1. Move DOWN from (7,5) to (7,4)
2. Move LEFT to (6,4)
3. Move LEFT to (5,4)
4. Change direction to DOWN
   - Wait, can I change direction after moving left twice?

Wait, no—each move is a new direction choice. After each move, the current direction changes based on what was chosen.

So let's map out directions:

- Start at (7,5), direction RIGHT.
- First move: choose DOWN → head to (7,4). Now direction is DOWN.
- Next move from (7,4): can't go UP. Choose LEFT or RIGHT. Let's choose LEFT → (6,4). Direction now is LEFT.
- Next move from (6,4): can't go RIGHT. Choose LEFT again → (5,4). Direction is LEFT.
- Next move: can't go RIGHT. Now need to change direction to DOWN to head south.

But wait, after moving LEFT three times, the head would be at 4,4. Then direction is still LEFT. Next move from 4,4 could be LEFT again to 3,4, but that's further away from apple which is at (2,0). Alternatively, perhaps turn DOWN now.

Wait, no—if I'm moving LEFT and want to change to DOWN, can I do that? Yes, as long as it's not the opposite direction. Since previous direction was LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT.

So after being at 4,4 with direction LEFT, next possible moves are UP or DOWN.

If I choose DOWN from 4,4 → (4,3). Now direction is DOWN.

From there, continue moving DOWN until y=0.

Once at y=0, then can move LEFT towards x=2.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Move DOWN: (7,5) → (7,4)
2. Move LEFT: (7,4) → (6,4)
3. Move LEFT: (6,4) → (5,4)
4. Move LEFT: (5,4) → (4,4)
5. Move DOWN: (4,4) → (4,3)
6. Move DOWN: (4,3) → (4,2)
7. Move DOWN: (4,2) → (4,1)
8. Move DOWN: (4,1) → (4,0)
9. Now at (4,0). Next move can't be UP.
   - Choose LEFT: (4,0) → (3,0)
10. Continue moving LEFT:
    (3,0) → (2,0) → eaten apple.

Wait, but when you reach the apple, you eat it, so body grows? Or do you just stop?

But in this case, moving from (4,0) to (3,0) is safe. Then to (2,0). At that point, the head is at (2,0), which is the apple's position.

So total moves: 8 steps down and then 2 steps left? Wait, no—let me recount:

From step 1-4: moving from 7,5 → 7,4 →6,4→5,4→4,4 (four moves).

Then move down four times to reach 4,0 (steps 5-8). Then two more moves left to reach 2,0.

So total of 8+2=10 moves. But perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, maybe moving in a different order could get us there faster.

But considering the constraints on direction changes, it might not be possible to do much better than this.

Another thought: after reaching (4,4), instead of going all the way down, perhaps move west further before turning south. But I'm not sure if that would help.

Alternatively, maybe a different initial direction choice could lead to a shorter path.

Wait, from the starting position, moving DOWN first is necessary because can't move LEFT immediately due to direction constraints.

Another approach: what's the Manhattan distance? From (7,5) to (2,0): 5 left and 5 down. So 10 moves required. So perhaps it's optimal to go directly south then west or vice versa.

But given that we can't reverse direction on first move, we have to start with either UP or DOWN. Let me think about both options.

Option 1: First move DOWN.

As above, leads to moving down and then left, total of 10 moves.

Option 2: First move UP instead of DOWN.

From (7,5), moving UP to (7,6). Then next moves could be LEFT or RIGHT.

But since the apple is at (2,0), which is below, perhaps moving up initially would require more steps south later, making it longer. So probably not optimal.

Therefore, Option 1 seems better.

So the sequence of directions would be:

DOWN, then three LEFTs, then four DOWNs, then two LEFTs.

But let's make sure that each move doesn't cause collision with body except possibly the tail.

After first move (DOWN to 7,4):

Body is [7,5], [6,5], [5,5]. New head is 7,4. Safe.

Second move: LEFT to 6,4. Body becomes [7,4], [7,5], [6,5]. Safe.

Third move: LEFT to 5,4. Body becomes [6,4], [7,4], [7,5]. Safe.

Fourth move: LEFT to 4,4. Body becomes [5,4], [6,4], [7,4]. Safe.

Fifth move: DOWN to 4,3. Body becomes [4,4], [5,4], [6,4]. Safe.

Sixth move: DOWN to 4,2. Body becomes [4,3], [4,4], [5,4]. Safe.

Seventh move: DOWN to 4,1. Body becomes [4,2], [4,3], [4,4]. Safe.

Eighth move: DOWN to 4,0. Body becomes [4,1], [4,2], [4,3]. Safe.

Ninth move: LEFT to 3,0. Now check collision with body [4,0], [4,1], [4,2]. Safe.

Tenth move: LEFT to 2,0. Eaten apple.

So yes, this path works without collisions.

Therefore, the sequence of directions is:

DOWN, then LEFT three times, then DOWN four times, then LEFT twice.

But in terms of actual moves, each step is a single direction choice.

Thus, the first move must be DOWN (since can't go LEFT), and from there proceed accordingly.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to guide the snake from its starting position at (7,5) to eat the apple located at (2,0). The snake must navigate through the grid without colliding with its own body. The movement rules dictate that the snake cannot reverse direction immediately after each move.

### Approach
1. **Initial Position and Constraints**: The snake starts at (7,5) moving in the "RIGHT" direction. Due to the constraint, it cannot reverse direction on the first move, meaning it can't go "LEFT" initially.
2. **First Move**: The snake moves "DOWN" from (7,5) to (7,4) to avoid reversing direction and to start heading towards the apple's vertical position.
3. **Subsequent Moves**: After moving down, the snake needs to navigate left and then further down. Each move must be carefully chosen to avoid colliding with its body segments.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the sequence of moves required for the snake to reach the apple at (2,0).

def main():
    # Initial position of head
    x, y = 7, 5
    # Initial direction is RIGHT
    directions = ['DOWN', 'LEFT', 'LEFT', 'LEFT', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'LEFT']
    
    print("Starting at:", (x, y))
    for move in directions:
        if move == 'UP':
            y += 1
        elif move == 'DOWN':
            y -= 1
        elif move == 'RIGHT':
            x += 1
        elif move == 'LEFT':
            x -= 1
        print("Move direction:", move, "New position:", (x, y))
    print("Apple eaten at:", (x, y))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
The snake starts by moving down from (7,5) to (7,4). It then moves left three times to reach (4,4). From there, it continues moving down four times to get to (4,0). Finally, it moves left twice to reach the apple at (2,0). Each move is chosen to ensure the snake progresses towards the target without colliding with its own body, adhering to the movement constraints. This approach efficiently navigates the snake through the grid using a sequence of carefully planned moves.
