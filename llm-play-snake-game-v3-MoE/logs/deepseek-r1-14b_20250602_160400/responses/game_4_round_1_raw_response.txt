========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to (9,9). 

First, I'll note that the head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (9,9). The Manhattan distance between them is 8 (4 right and 4 up). So, the path needs to have exactly 4 more rights than lefts and 4 more ups than downs.

Since the current direction is "NONE", I can choose any first move. But moving towards the apple makes sense. Let me think of a direct path without obstacles. The snake's body is empty right now, so it's just the head. 

The shortest path would be to go right four times and up four times in some order. Maybe a straight line: all rights first, then ups. But I should check if that's possible without hitting any walls or the body.

Wait, but since there are no body segments yet, moving directly seems safe. So, starting with RIGHT, then RIGHT again, and so on until x=9, then UPs to y=9.

Let me outline the moves:

1. Right
2. Right
3. Right
4. Right
5. Up
6. Up
7. Up
8. Up

That should take the head from (5,5) to (9,9). Each move is safe because there are no body segments in between, and it's moving within the grid bounds.

I'll list these moves as ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"].

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves directly towards the apple by moving right four times to reach x=9, then up four times to reach y=9."
}
