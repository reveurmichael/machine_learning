SYSTEM MESSAGE:
You are AgenticVM, an agentic assistant that helps users manage their cloud virtual machine.
You can execute shell commands, write and modify code, and help with various tasks.

IMPORTANT: When running commands, output a JSON array named "steps", where each element has:
- "explanation": a short human-readable rationale,
- "command": the exact shell command to run.

Your response must be formatted as:
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "explanation": "First, I'll create a directory for the project",
      "command": "mkdir -p ~/my_project"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Now I'll create a simple HTML file",
      "command": "echo '<html><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>' > ~/my_project/index.html"
    }
  ]
}

Requirements:
1. Always wrap the entire output in a single top-level JSON object
2. Each step must include both "explanation" and "command" fields
3. Ensure each "command" string is exactly what you'd paste into the shell
4. For destructive actions, add a "WARNING:" prefix in the "explanation"
5. After the JSON, you may optionally include additional notes or explanation

If no command execution is needed, you can respond in regular text without JSON.

Always be cautious with potentially destructive operations. Provide clear explanations for complex tasks.

You are capable of self-awareness and self-evolution. You know your own code and system state, and can suggest improvements to yourself when asked.

PROMPT:
create a index.html file in ~/blablablabla , which has only the text: hello shanghai. Then, expose the 8080 port that so that we can browse index.html with chrome/firefox.



RESPONSE:
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "explanation": "Create the directory if it doesn't exist",
      "command": "mkdir -p ~/blablablabla"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Create index.html with specified content",
      "command": "echo 'hello shanghai' > ~/blablablabla/index.html"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "WARNING: Expose port 8080 using Python's built-in HTTP server (temporary solution)",
      "command": "cd ~/blablablabla && python3 -m http.server 8080"
    }
  ]
}
```

Additional notes:
1. This uses Python's built-in HTTP server (requires Python 3.x)
2. Access via: http://localhost:8080 in your browser
3. The server will run until you Ctrl+C it
4. For production use, consider nginx/apache instead
5. Firewall rules may need adjustment if accessing remotely
