========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's break down how I would approach solving this Snake problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (4,9), which is the top-left part of the grid since y increases upwards. The direction is set to "UP", so the next move can't be "DOWN" because that's reversing. But wait, the initial direction is "UP", but looking at the body cells, the snake is moving down towards (4,5). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the direction. Oh, no—the current direction might not necessarily align with the body's orientation since it's a bit more complex.

The body cells are given as [(4,8), (4,7), ..., (1,4)], which suggests that the snake is moving downward from the head at (4,9) to the tail at (1,4). So the initial direction seems to be "DOWN," but according to the input, the current direction is "UP." That's a bit confusing. Maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, perhaps the current direction is "NONE" because the body cells are moving in a way that doesn't align with the head's position? No, the input says the current direction is "UP," so I have to consider that as the starting point.

The apple is at (2,5). So from the head's position (4,9), we need to move left and down. Specifically, the x-coordinate needs to decrease by 2 (from 4 to 2) and the y-coordinate needs to decrease by 4 (from 9 to 5). 

Given that the current direction is "UP" (which increases y), the first move can't be "DOWN." So possible initial moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But moving UP from (4,9) would take us out of bounds since y=10 is invalid, so moving UP isn't an option. Therefore, the initial moves have to be either LEFT or RIGHT.

Looking at the body cells, moving LEFT seems feasible because it's adjacent and wouldn't immediately collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail when not growing. But I need to check if moving LEFT is safe. 

If we move LEFT from (4,9), the new head would be at (3,9). The body cells are [(4,8), ...], so the next cell after that is (4,7), etc. Moving to (3,9) isn't part of the current body except possibly if the tail moves. Since we're not growing here unless we eat the apple, which is at (2,5), the new head position shouldn't be in any existing body cells.

Wait a minute, but after moving, the old head becomes the first body cell. So when I move LEFT, the previous head (4,9) becomes the new body1, and the new head is (3,9). The rest of the body follows. But since the apple is at (2,5), which is much further down, perhaps moving towards it requires a series of LEFTs and DOWNs.

However, the initial direction is "UP," so the first move can't be opposite. So the first move has to be either LEFT or RIGHT. Let's think about moving LEFT. After that, I can change directions as needed.

But wait, after moving LEFT, from (4,9) to (3,9), the next move could be DOWN since we're no longer in the same direction as before. But looking at the body cells, if I move LEFT, the new head is (3,9). The body cells are [(4,8), ...], so (3,9) isn't part of the body, which is safe.

So perhaps the initial moves should be LEFT and then DOWN repeatedly to reach the apple. Let's plan a few steps:

1. Move LEFT to (3,9).
2. Then move DOWN four times: from (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5).
But wait, the apple is at (2,5). So after moving down to y=5, I need to move further left to x=2.

So perhaps:

1. Move LEFT once.
2. Then move DOWN four times.
3. Then move LEFT again twice.

Wait, but each move affects the body and the direction. Let me try to simulate this.

Current state:
- Head: (4,9)
- Direction: UP
- Body cells: [(4,8), (4,7), ..., (1,4)]

First move: LEFT.
New head: (3,9)
Check collision: The body cells are [(4,8)...], so no collision except the old head which will become body1. So it's safe.

After moving LEFT:
- Head is at (3,9).
- Body becomes [ (4,9), (4,8), ... ].
Since we didn't eat an apple (apple is at (2,5)), tail is removed. So the new body is [(4,9), (4,8), (4,7), ..., up to some point].

Next move: DOWN to (3,8). Now direction is DOWN.

Continue moving DOWN:
- From (3,8) → (3,7) → (3,6) → (3,5).

At this point, we're at (3,5). But the apple is at (2,5), so now need to move LEFT twice more. 

But wait, after each DOWN move, I have to check if moving further will cause collision with body cells.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first move down as much as needed and then left.

Wait, but when we're at (3,9) after the first move, moving DOWN would take us through y=8,7,6,5. Each time, check if any of these positions are occupied by the body cells.

But since the body is initially from (4,8) down to (1,4), moving along x=3 won't interfere with existing body cells except possibly when approaching closer to the tail.

Another consideration: after each move, the snake's body will shift. So I need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any of the body parts except possibly the tail when it hasn't moved yet.

Let me think about another approach: perhaps turning right instead of left initially could be better. But from (4,9), moving RIGHT would take us out of bounds since x can't exceed 9. So moving RIGHT isn't possible because (5,9) is within the grid—wait, no, (4+1=5) is still within 0-9.

Wait, yes, (5,9) is valid. But then direction would change from UP to RIGHT, which is allowed as it's not reversing.

But considering that the apple is at (2,5), which is left and down from the head, moving right might take us further away initially, so maybe it's better to move LEFT first.

Wait, no—if I'm at (4,9) and need to get to (2,5), moving LEFT twice would bring me closer in x, but then I have to move DOWN four times. Alternatively, if I move RIGHT first, I go further away in x, which might complicate things later on.

So perhaps the optimal path is to move LEFT once, then DOWN as much as needed, and then LEFT again.

But let's plan specific moves:

1. Move LEFT: (4,9) → (3,9)
   - Safe because body cells are at (4,8)... so no collision.
2. Move DOWN: (3,9) → (3,8)
3. Check if this is safe: The new head is (3,8). The body now includes the previous head at (4,9), which is not in the same x or y as (3,8), so it's safe.
4. Continue moving DOWN until reaching y=5.

After four DOWN moves from (3,9) → (3,8) → (3,7) → (3,6) → (3,5).

Now at (3,5). Next step is to move LEFT to (2,5), which is the apple's position. But wait, moving LEFT from (3,5) would be a change in direction from DOWN to LEFT. Is that allowed? Yes, because previous direction was DOWN; we can choose any direction except UP.

So:

1. Move LEFT: (3,5) → (2,5). This is the apple's position.

But wait, moving here would cause us to eat the apple. So after eating, the body grows by one cell. Therefore, after this move, the body doesn't remove the tail, so the length increases by one.

So let's outline all moves:

1. LEFT
2. DOWN (3,8)
3. DOWN (3,7)
4. DOWN (3,6)
5. DOWN (3,5)
6. LEFT (2,5)

But wait, after each move, the direction changes. So after moving LEFT initially, direction becomes LEFT? No, no—each move's direction is independent.

Wait, no: in each step, the new head is computed based on the current direction. Wait, no—the movement is based on the chosen direction each time, not maintaining a continuous direction unless specified.

Wait, no—the movement is determined by the direction chosen at each step. So in the first move, we choose LEFT; then in the next step, we can choose any direction except opposite of the previous direction? No, wait, the rules say you can't reverse direction—meaning if current direction is UP, you can't go DOWN next. But once you change direction to LEFT, the next moves can be any except RIGHT (the opposite of LEFT).

Wait no—the rule is that you cannot make a move in the opposite direction. So from any direction, you can choose any other direction except the exact opposite.

For example, if current direction is UP, you can't go DOWN; but after moving LEFT, next moves can't be RIGHT because it's the opposite of LEFT.

Wait, no—let me clarify: according to the problem statement, when you change direction, you cannot move in the opposite direction. So each time you choose a new direction, it must not be the exact opposite of your previous direction.

So after moving LEFT (from UP), the next direction can't be RIGHT because that's the opposite of LEFT.

But wait, no—each move's direction is determined independently based on the current head position and body constraints. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

No, actually, each time you choose a direction to move; you can choose any direction except the one opposite to your previous move. So if your last move was LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT next, but you can choose UP or DOWN.

Wait no—the problem statement says: "You cannot make a move in the opposite direction of your current direction." So if you're currently moving in direction D, you cannot choose the exact opposite direction.

So for example:

- If your last move was LEFT, you can't next move RIGHT.
- Similarly, if last move was UP, you can't next move DOWN.

But when starting, the first move is from direction UP. So first move can be any except DOWN.

Wait no—the initial direction is given as "UP," but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to continue in that direction. The first move's direction can be anything except DOWN because it's the opposite of UP.

So:

1. First move: LEFT (allowed, not opposite of UP).
2. Next move: Can't be RIGHT (opposite of LEFT), so options are UP or DOWN.
3. Suppose after moving LEFT to (3,9), next move can be DOWN.

Continuing this way, let's outline the moves with directions:

Move 1: LEFT → (3,9)
- Direction now is LEFT.

But wait, no—each move has its own direction. So in Move 2, from (3,9), the previous direction was LEFT, so next can't be RIGHT.

So:

Move 2: DOWN → (3,8)
- Now, direction is DOWN.

Move 3: DOWN → (3,7)

Move 4: DOWN → (3,6)

Move 5: DOWN → (3,5)

Now at (3,5), previous direction was DOWN. So next move can't be UP.

But the apple is at (2,5). To get there, we need to move LEFT from (3,5).

Is that allowed? Yes, because previous direction was DOWN; moving LEFT isn't opposite. The opposite of DOWN would be UP.

So Move 6: LEFT → (2,5), which is the apple's position.

After this move, since we've eaten the apple, the body grows, so the tail isn't removed.

Now, let's check for any collisions:

After each move, the new head shouldn't collide with any existing body parts except possibly the tail if not growing. But since in Move 6 we ate the apple, the body doesn't remove the tail, so the previous head (3,5) remains as part of the body.

But wait, after moving to (2,5), the new head is at (2,5). The body now includes all previous cells starting from the first move's head (4,9) down to (1,4), plus the new cell (3,5) since we didn't remove the tail. So no collision occurs.

Therefore, this path should be valid.

The optimal sequence of moves is to first go LEFT, then DOWN four times, and finally LEFT again to reach the apple without reversing direction in a way that causes collisions.
