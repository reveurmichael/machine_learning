You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (2,4), and the apple is at (1,4). So, the head needs to move left because the x-coordinate of the apple is less than that of the head.

First, I notice that the current direction is "LEFT," which means the next move can't be "RIGHT" due to the no-reverse rule. That's important because it restricts our options for the first move.

Looking at the body cells, there's only one segment behind the head at (3,4). So, if we move left to (1,4), that would place the new head directly on the apple. Now, I need to check for collisions. The new head is within bounds since x=1 and y=4 are both valid.

Next, checking the body cells: after moving left, the old head (2,4) becomes the first body segment. Since the new head is at (1,4), it's not colliding with any other body segments except possibly when considering where the tail will move. However, since we're eating the apple, the tail won't move this turn, so no collision occurs.

After moving to the apple, the snake grows by one segment, making the body [(2,4), (3,4)]. Now, I need to ensure that after growing, there's at least one legal move next turn. Since the snake is now longer but still has space around it, and given that we're only taking one step, it should be manageable.

So, moving "LEFT" once will get us to the apple safely.
</think>

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake can move directly left to reach the apple without any collision risk."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(3, 4)], to eat the apple at (1, 4).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
