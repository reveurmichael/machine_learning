========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake starts at (2,4) and needs to reach the apple at (3,4). Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the initial setup. The snake's head is at (2,4), which means its x-coordinate is 2 and y is 4. The direction is DOWN, so if it moves normally without eating, it would go to (2,3). But since there's an apple involved, maybe moving down isn't the best idea because the apple is directly in front of the head.

Looking at the body segments, we have [(2,5), (2,6)]. So, currently, behind the head are two cells. The snake can't reverse direction right now because it's NONE. That means on the first move, any direction except UP or DOWN might be allowed? Wait, no—the rules say you can only reverse if current is UP/DOWN and next isn't LEFT/RIGHT or vice versa. But since current direction is DOWN, you can't move UP immediately. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

The apple is at (3,4). The head is already just below the apple—head is at (2,4), so moving right once would get it there. But we need to check if that's possible without colliding with the body or itself next step.

If I try moving RIGHT first: new_head becomes (3,4) which is where the apple is. So this should be allowed because eating the apple means the snake grows and doesn't lose its tail unless it just ate an apple before. Since there was no previous apple eaten in this scenario (as per input), the tail won't move.

So moving RIGHT would take the head to the apple, grow the snake by one segment, and then the body segments shift. The current body is [(2,5), (2,6)], which becomes [(3,4), (2,5), (2,6)] after inserting the old head as the new first part. Wait no—the movement rule says insert the old head at the front of the body list.

Wait, initial snake S is [head, body1, body2]. So when moving RIGHT, new_head is (3,4). Then, we update the body by removing the tail if not eating apple.

But in this case, since new_head == apple position, it grows. So the new snake becomes:

new_head = (3,4), then insert old head (2,4) at front: S_new = [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)].

Then, remove the tail only if not eating apple. Since we did eat it, the tail remains. So the new body is [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]. 

Wait, no: when you grow by eating an apple, the body doesn't lose its last segment because the head is added and the tail only moves if not eating.

So after moving RIGHT:

- new_head is (3,4)
- insert old head at front of body list → body becomes [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]
- since apple was eaten, do NOT remove tail. So the new snake length remains 4 segments: [head (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)].

But wait, after moving RIGHT, does that cause any collision? Because body1 is now at (2,4), which was previously behind the head but in this case, it's okay because we're growing. So no immediate collision here.

So the initial move seems safe—move RIGHT to reach the apple.
</think>

The snake can safely move RIGHT once since doing so leads directly to the apple without causing any collisions or reversals.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving right from (2,4) reaches the apple at (3,4). The body segments do not block this path."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(2, 5), (2, 6)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (3, 4). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
