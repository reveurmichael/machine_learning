<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (6,6). The current direction is NONE, which means the first move can be any direction except reversing. Wait, no, actually, the movement rules say that if the direction is NONE, any move is allowed on the first step. So I don't have to worry about reversing because the initial direction is NONE.

First, let me visualize the grid. The snake's head is at (5,5), which is in the middle of a 10x10 grid. The apple is just one unit to the right and one unit up from the head, so moving RIGHT and then UP would get there. But I need to make sure that after each move, the snake doesn't collide with its body or go out of bounds.

Looking at the body cells, they are empty, so the snake isn't very long yet. That means the tail is just behind the head, but since it's empty, maybe the snake has only the head right now? Or perhaps the body cells include previous positions that have been added when the snake ate apples before. Since the body cells list is empty in this case, I think the snake is at its minimum length, so moving directly towards the apple should be straightforward.

The movement rules also mention that after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment. So when it eats the apple, the tail doesn't shrink on the next move. That means if we eat the apple, the body will have an extra segment.

So the plan is to move RIGHT and then UP. Let's check each step:

1. Move RIGHT: From (5,5) to (6,5). Since the initial direction is NONE, moving RIGHT is allowed. After this move, the snake's head is at (6,5), and since we ate the apple, the body will grow by one segment, so the tail remains. Wait, no—the apple is at (6,6), not (6,5). So when moving to (6,5), we haven't eaten the apple yet.

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. The snake's head starts at (5,5) and needs to reach (6,6). So moving RIGHT first would take it to (6,5), then UP to (6,6). That should work because from (5,5), moving right is one step towards the apple's x-coordinate, and then up for the y-coordinate.

But let me think about the constraints again. The movement rules say that after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move afterward. So when we reach the apple, the next move should still leave the snake with possible moves without dying.

Wait, but in this case, once the head is at (6,6), which is where the apple is, the body hasn't moved yet. So after eating the apple, the body would grow, so the tail wouldn't be removed. That means that as long as we don't reverse direction and don't hit any walls or body parts, it should be safe.

Another thing to consider: when moving to (6,5), the snake's body is just [(5,5)] since the initial direction was NONE, so there are no other segments yet. So after moving RIGHT to (6,5), the body becomes [(5,5)], and then when we move UP to (6,6), which is where the apple is.

Wait, but in this case, the body would be [ (5,5) ] after moving to (6,5). Then, when moving UP to (6,6), the new head is (6,6), and since it's the apple's position, the snake grows. So the body becomes [(5,5), (6,5)], and the tail doesn't get removed.

So now the snake has a body at (5,5) and (6,5). Then, when moving UP to (6,6), which is the apple, that's the end of the move. The next step after eating would require checking for possible moves from there.

But wait, in our case, we only need two moves: RIGHT then UP. So let me check if this path is safe.

First move: HEAD at (5,5) → move RIGHT to (6,5). Since direction was NONE, no issue. After moving, body cells are [(5,5)], and the head is now (6,5).

Second move: from (6,5), current direction is RIGHT. So next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse direction. Wait, wait—the current direction after first move is RIGHT, so next move can't be DOWN or something? Or does each move change the direction?

Wait, movement rules say that you can't reverse direction. Reversing would mean moving in the opposite of the current direction. So if you're going RIGHT, you can't go LEFT next.

But in our case, after moving RIGHT, the direction is now RIGHT. Then for the second move, we need to change direction to UP. But from the current direction (RIGHT), can we switch to UP? Yes, because it's not reversing; it's changing to a perpendicular direction.

Wait no, the movement rules say you cannot reverse direction. So if the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT except for LEFT, which would be moving back—wait no: reversing would be going from RIGHT to LEFT, which is directly opposite. So in this case, after moving RIGHT, we can't go LEFT next.

So our first move is RIGHT, direction becomes RIGHT. Second move needs to be UP, which is allowed because it's not the reverse of RIGHT (which would be LEFT). So that should be fine.

Wait no: when you're moving in a certain direction, your next move can't be the opposite. For example, if you're going RIGHT, next can't be LEFT; if going UP, next can't be DOWN.

So after moving RIGHT to (6,5), the current direction is RIGHT. So next moves cannot be LEFT. But we want to go UP. That's allowed.

Therefore, the path would be:

1. Move RIGHT → (6,5)
2. Move UP → (6,6)

Now, checking the constraints again: after eating the apple at (6,6), there must be at least one legal move afterward. So when the snake is at (6,6) having eaten the apple, it's body would have grown by one segment, so the tail remains. The new body cells would be [(5,5), (6,5)], and the head is now at (6,6).

So after eating the apple, what are the possible moves? Let's see:

Current position: head at (6,6), body at (5,5) and (6,5). The direction was UP when it moved to (6,6).

Possible next move directions:

- Can't go DOWN because that would reverse from UP.
- Can't go LEFT because from (6,6), moving left is (5,6), which is outside the body except for checking if it's in any part of the body. The body cells are [(5,5), (6,5)]. So (5,6) isn't a body cell, so that's allowed.
- Can move RIGHT? From (6,6), moving right would take to (7,6). That's within grid bounds. But wait, current direction was UP when it moved to (6,6). Now, the next move can be any except DOWN because you can't reverse.

Wait no: after eating the apple, the direction is UP. The next move cannot be DOWN as that would reverse the direction. So from (6,6), possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT, but not DOWN.

But in this case, we only need to eat the apple; our path ends there. So perhaps it's acceptable because after eating, the snake can still make a legal move (like moving LEFT).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that once you reach the apple, you don't need to care about what comes next, but according to constraints, you have to ensure that after eating, there's at least one legal move. So in this case, yes, because from (6,6), you can move LEFT or RIGHT.

Therefore, the path of two moves: RIGHT then UP is valid.

Another thing to consider: Manhattan distance. The apple is at (6,6). From (5,5), the Manhattan distance is 2 (1 right and 1 up). So a direct path would be optimal.

But wait, sometimes in such puzzles, you might have obstacles or body segments that require detours. In this case, since there are no body segments except the head, it's safe to go straight.

So putting it all together:

Moves: ["RIGHT", "UP"]

The reasoning is that moving right then up directly reaches the apple without any risk of collision, and after eating, the snake can still move legally.

{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Moving RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5), then UP to (6,6), safely reaches the apple. This path avoids body collisions as there are no other segments and ensures a valid next move."
}
```

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (6, 6).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
