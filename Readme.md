## Asking questions :question:

#### 使用 **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)** 提问
By default, you should ask questions via **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)**. Here is how:
- https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1364y1h7sb/

#### Principe
Here is the principle for asking questions:

>  **Google First, Peers Second, Profs Last.**

You are expected to ask questions via **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)**. However, as a **secondary**  (and hence, less desirable, less encouraged) choice, 
you could also 
ask questions in the WeChat group.

> Why Gitee Issue? Because it's simply more **professional**, and better in every sense.

In Gitee Issue and the WeChat group, questions will be answered selectively. 

Questions won't be answered if:
- they could be solved on a simple Google search
- they are out of the scope of the course
- they are well in advance of the progress of the course
- professors think that it's not interesting for discussion

#### Regarding personal WeChat chats:
- **Questions asked in personal WeChat chats will NOT be answered.**
- **Messages sent after 21:00 in personal chats will be extremely unwelcome.**

Learning how to use Google & Baidu & Bing to solve programming problems is an important skill you should develop during this course.

#### Office visit

Office visit is NOT welcome unless you make an appointment at least one day in advance.
