Alright, so I've got this Snake game problem to solve. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the current state: the snake is at (8,4) facing DOWN. The body has only one cell at (8,5), which means the snake hasn't eaten any apples yet because if there was an apple before, it would have grown its body. But looking at the coordinates, since it's just the head and the next segment is behind, maybe it didn't eat anything.

The apple is at (6,0). So I need to figure out a path from (8,4) down towards (6,0), but without colliding with itself or going off the grid. Also, remember that each move changes the head's position by one cell in the direction of movement.

Starting point: head at (8,4), body is at (8,5). So when moving DOWN, the next position would be (8,3), but wait, no—the current direction is DOWN, so right now it's pointing DOWN. But according to the movement rules, the snake cannot reverse direction immediately unless it's NONE.

Wait, the initial direction is DOWN, and we can't move UP next. So first, possible moves from DOWN are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN if allowed.

But wait, let me clarify: when moving in a direction, after each step, the head moves, then the body follows. The current direction is DOWN, so if it continues moving DOWN again, that's fine as long as it doesn't hit itself. But since the body hasn't grown yet (since no apple eaten), the next position would be (8,3). Since (8,5) is behind, moving DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3) seems possible.

But wait, let's check for collisions. The head at (8,4) moves down to (8,3). Is that cell occupied? Currently, the body is only at (8,5), so (8,3) is free. So moving DOWN would be safe.

So first move: DOWN to (8,3).

Now, after moving DOWN, the snake's head is now at (8,3). The body was at (8,4), but it has moved forward—so the new tail position will be removed unless an apple is eaten. So in this case, no apple yet, so the tail at (8,5) remains.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with how the snake moves. Let me think: when you move, the head goes to the next cell in the direction of movement, and then each body segment follows. But since it's a 10x10 grid and only has one body after the head, moving DOWN once would just place the new head at (8,3), with the body now at (8,4). So no collision there.

But wait, if the snake is only two segments long: head at (8,4) and body at (8,5). After moving DOWN to (8,3), the new head position is (8,3), then each body segment moves one step in the same direction. But since it's only two segments, after moving once, the tail would be removed unless an apple was eaten.

Wait no—actually, each move adds a new head and removes the old tail unless an apple is eaten. So if we're moving DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3), then the new head is at (8,3). The body segments shift: the previous head's position becomes the next segment, so (8,4) moves down to (8,5)? Wait that doesn't make sense.

Wait no—if you have a snake moving DOWN once from (8,4) with direction DOWN, then each part of the body follows. But since there are only two segments—head at (8,4) and body at (8,5)—moving DOWN would mean:

- New head position is (8,3)
- The old head at (8,4) becomes the new segment below it
- The tail was at (8,5), which remains unless an apple is eaten.

But since there's no apple, moving down once from (8,4) to (8,3)—the body would now be:

- Head: (8,3)
- Next segment: (8,4)
- Tail remains at (8,5)

Wait that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the snake moves.

Let me get this straight: in each move, the entire snake shifts forward by one cell in the direction of movement. So if you have a head at (x,y) and body segments behind it, moving once will shift all segments down by one.

But since we only have two segments—head at (8,4), then next segment is (8,5)—so when you move DOWN:

- The new head is (8,3)
- The old head (8,4) becomes the second segment
- The tail was (8,5) and remains as it is.

So after moving DOWN once, the snake's body would be at (8,4), (8,3)—but wait that can't be because when you move down from (8,4), your next position should be (8,3). So perhaps I have to think in terms of each segment following.

Wait no—actually, moving DOWN once:

- The head moves from (8,4) to (8,3)
- Then the body segments follow. Since there's only one segment after the head at (8,5), that segment would move down as well—to (8,4). So now, the snake is two segments: (8,3) and (8,4).

Wait no—that can't be right because then moving DOWN again from (8,3) would take it to (8,2), but if there's a body segment at (8,4), that wouldn't cause a collision.

But wait the initial state is head at (8,4), body at (8,5). So when moving DOWN once:

- New head: (8,3)
- Old head position (8,4) becomes the next segment
- Tail was at (8,5), which remains as it is. Wait but with two segments, how does that work?

I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps each move shifts all body parts by one in the direction of movement—so if you're moving DOWN from a head position (x,y) and the next segment is at (x,y+1), then both would shift down to (x,y-1).

But since there's only two segments—the head and one body—we have:

After move:

Head: (8,3)
Body: (8,4)

Tail remains at (8,5). So moving DOWN once seems safe.

Wait but when you move again, the next position would be from (8,3) to (8,2), and the body segments are now at (8,4) and (8,5)—so no collision there.

But wait—when you have a two-segment snake:

- Head: H
- Body: B

When moving direction D:

H moves to H' = H + D.
Then B moves to B' = B + D.
Tail remains unless an apple is eaten.

So in the initial state, H=(8,4), B=(8,5). After one move DOWN:

H becomes (8,3)
B becomes (8,4)

So tail at (8,5) remains. So no collision because (8,3) and (8,4) are both free.

Okay, so moving DOWN once is safe.

But wait the current direction is DOWN, but according to movement rules: if the direction is "DOWN", then next move can't be UP. But in terms of steps beyond that, does it matter?

Wait no—the direction cannot reverse on the first move—so after being at DOWN, you can't immediately go UP.

But moving down once again isn't a reversal—it's allowed because you were already facing down and are still facing down (or have changed direction).

So now, let me try to plan a path from (8,4) towards (6,0). The apple is at (6,0), which requires the snake to move left twice and up four times.

But I need to make sure each step doesn't cause collision with body or walls.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT multiple times first would be better. Let's see: from (8,4) moving LEFT two steps to get closer in x-direction.

Wait no—since 6 is less than 8, so LEFT twice would take the head from (8,4) to (6,4), then to (5,4). From there, we can start moving UP towards y=0.

But let's check:

From current position: (8,4) facing DOWN. So options for first move are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If I try to move LEFT twice—since direction is DOWN, but perhaps changing direction to LEFT might be necessary because moving left would allow us to get closer in the x-axis without increasing y too much.

But wait no—if you change direction from DOWN to LEFT on a later step, that's allowed since only consecutive reversals are prohibited. But initially, first move can't reverse—so from DOWN, next moves can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

So perhaps moving LEFT would be better because it gets us closer in x-direction towards 6.

But wait: head is at (8,4), direction DOWN. So movement is restricted to down, left, right, but not up on first move. So first step must be either LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But let's see what moving LEFT does:

Move LEFT once from (8,4) would take us to (7,4). Is that possible? Let's check for collision.

After moving LEFT, the new head is at (7,4), and the body was at (8,5). So no collision. Then can we continue LEFT again?

Wait wait, if I'm now facing down but move LEFT once, my direction becomes LEFT from then on, unless I reverse it in a later step.

But according to movement rules: you cannot reverse direction immediately—so moving from DOWN to LEFT is allowed as long as it's not immediate reversal. But since the initial direction is DOWN and next move can be any except UP, so moving LEFT is fine.

So perhaps first move LEFT once to (7,4). Then another LEFT to (6,4).

Now at (6,4), with body segments shifted accordingly. From there, I need to go up four times: from y=4 down to 0—wait no, wait movement is UP which increases y.

Wait correction: according to the coordinate system:

UP = y +1

DOWN = y -1

RIGHT = x+1

LEFT =x-1

So if current position is (6,4), moving UP would take us to (6,5). But we need to go from (6,4) to (6,0)—so actually, moving DOWN four times? Wait no:

Wait wait the apple is at (6,0). So starting from (6,4):

To get down towards y=0, you have to move DOWN each time because y decreases by 1 per DOWN.

But wait: in terms of coordinate system, UP increases y, DOWN decreases y. So moving FROM (6,4) to (6,3): that's a DOWN move.

Wait no—that can't be right because if the snake is at (8,4), and apple is at (6,0)—so for x from 8 to 6, need two LEFT moves; for y from 4 down to 0, which would require moving UP? Wait wait I'm getting confused.

Wait: according to movement rules:

UP = y+1

DOWN = y-1

So if you're at (x,y) and move UP, new position is (x, y+1).

Similarly, moving DOWN from (x,y) takes it to (x, y-1).

Wait so to get from (8,4) to (6,0):

The x needs to decrease by 2: so two LEFT moves.

The y needs to decrease by 4: four DOWN moves.

So the total is LEFT twice and DOWN four times. But order matters because after each move, the snake's body shifts.

But let me plan:

Current head position: (8,4), direction: DOWN

First move options: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If I try to go directly towards the apple by moving LEFT twice first, then DOWN four times.

So step 1: move LEFT from (8,4) to (7,4).

Step 2: move LEFT again from (7,4) to (6,4). Now at x=6, y=4. Facing direction was still DOWN? Or is it changed?

Wait no—when you moved LEFT twice, after each move, the direction remains DOWN unless changed.

So now head is at (6,4), direction still DOWN.

Now, need to go from (6,4) down four times: moving DOWN four steps.

But wait, can we do that without getting stuck?

From (6,4): first move DOWN to (6,3). Now the body segments are:

Head was (6,4), so after moving DOWN once, new head is (6,3), and previous head position becomes the next segment at (6,5).

Wait no—starting with two segments: initial head at (8,4), body at (8,5). After first move LEFT to (7,4): head now at (7,4), body was at (8,5) but hasn't moved yet. Then moving LEFT again to (6,4): the new head is (6,4), and previous head position (7,4) becomes the next segment.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

After two LEFT moves, now the snake's body includes:

- Head at (6,4)
- Next segment at (5,4) if another LEFT was taken. Wait no—only two segments before any moves: head and one behind. After moving LEFT once, head is (7,4), next segment is (8,4). Moving again to (6,4), the next segment becomes (7,4).

Wait maybe it's easier to model each move step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach would be:

- Move LEFT twice to get closer in x-direction.
- Then, turn around and start moving DOWN towards y=0.

But let me think about this: after two LEFTs from (8,4) to (6,4), the next moves must be DOWN four times. But will that cause any collision?

Each move:

1. Move LEFT to (7,4): safe.
2. Move LEFT again to (6,4): also safe.

Now at (6,4). Next step: move DOWN.

Move 3: from (6,4) to (6,3).

Now the snake's body segments are:

Head was (6,4), so after moving DOWN once, it becomes (6,3); the previous head position (5,4) is now the next segment. Wait no—initially, we had two segments: (8,4) and (8,5). After first LEFT to (7,4): body was at (8,5), then moving again to (6,4): body becomes (7,4).

So when you move DOWN once from (6,4):

- Head moves to (6,3)
- Previous head position (6,4) is now the next segment? Wait that can't be.

Wait maybe each time you move, all segments shift in the direction of movement. So moving DOWN once:

Head: (6,4) -> (6,3)

Body: previous head at (7,4) moves to (6,3)—but then it's the same as new head position? That would cause a collision.

Wait that can't be—so perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect. Maybe each move only affects the head and the next segment?

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN once from two-segment snake:

- Head at (6,4) moves to (6,3)
- Next segment at (7,4) moves to (6,3)—causing collision.

So that would be a problem—snake cannot have overlapping segments.

Wait so in this case, after moving LEFT twice, the next move DOWN from (6,4) would cause both head and body to collide on (6,3). So it's unsafe. Therefore, we can't make that move.

So perhaps changing direction earlier is necessary.

Alternative approach: instead of moving all lefts first, find a path where after some steps in LEFT, you don't have overlapping with the body when turning DOWN.

Alternatively, maybe move down once to (8,3) then change direction. Let's try:

Current position: (8,4), direction DOWN

Step 1: Move DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3). Now head is at (8,3), and the body was at (8,5), so after moving DOWN once, it becomes (7,4)?

Wait no—no. When you move down, both head and next segment follow.

So initially:

Head: (8,4)

Body: (8,5)

After moving DOWN once:

Head: (8,3)

Body: (8,4) [since the previous body was at (8,5), but in reality, after moving, each segment shifts by the direction. Wait perhaps for a two-segment snake, only the head moves, and the next segment follows.

But regardless of that confusion, let's try to see what happens when you move down:

From position (6,4), if we can't move DOWN because it would cause collision with body, maybe instead change direction earlier.

Wait another approach: think about making a U-turn towards left before moving DOWN. So after two LEFTs from (8,4) to (6,4), perhaps move RIGHT once and then DOWN four times.

But let's see:

From (6,4): Move RIGHT once to (7,4). Now body is at (6,5) which was the next segment when moving left twice. But after that, if I can find a way to avoid collision.

Wait but maybe this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps plan to go LEFT once from (8,4) to (7,4), then RIGHT once back to (8,4). That seems like wasted moves and not efficient.

Hmm.

Alternative idea: Maybe the snake needs to move in a way that it can turn around before heading towards the apple.

But given that after each move, only the head changes position, perhaps I should model this as a grid and see possible paths.

Alternatively, maybe try moving LEFT twice first but then have to adjust because of collision when trying to DOWN.

Wait another thought: The initial body is at (8,5). So if we can arrange for the snake's body not to be in certain positions when we turn down. Maybe instead of moving straight left, find a path that allows us to turn without collision.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving LEFT twice to reach (6,4), then move UP once or something else to avoid the collision with body segments.

Wait but if from (6,4) we try to move DOWN four times:

After first DOWN: new head is at (6,3). But was there a segment in (7,4)? If not, maybe safe. Wait no—when moving down from two-segment snake, the previous position of body would shift.

Wait I'm getting stuck here, perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me think about what needs to happen:

We need to move left twice and then down four times: total 6 moves.

But each move must be such that no part of the body collides with itself or goes out of bounds.

The initial position after two LEFTs would be (6,4) with body at previous positions?

Wait perhaps another way is to model the snake's body as a list and track its position step by step. But since this is getting complex, maybe it's better to think about possible directions.

Alternatively, perhaps use BFS to find the shortest path from current state to goal without collisions—though that might be overkill for manual planning.

But given time constraints, perhaps try to outline steps:

1. From (8,4), move LEFT twice: first to (7,4), then to (6,4).

2. Now at (6,4). Next step must be DOWN because moving left is not possible anymore since x is already 6.

3. Move DOWN from (6,4) to (5,4): Check for collision—body segments are at (8,5); after move, new body segments would be (7,5), but wait no: initial state was head at (8,4), body at (8,5). After two LEFTs:

- Head is now at (6,4)
- Next segment from first move was (7,4) [from moving LEFT once]
- Then second move to (6,4): next segment becomes (5,4)

Wait I'm getting confused with the body positions.

Perhaps it's better to model each move step by step for a two-segment snake:

Initial state: head at (8,4), body at (8,5).

Move 1: LEFT → new head at (7,4). Body moves from (8,5) to (7,5). So now snake is [(7,4), (7,5)].

Wait no—after moving LEFT once:

- Head was at (8,4); moved left to (7,4)
- The previous head position (8,4) becomes the next segment. But wait that would be (8,5)—wait no—the body is only one segment behind the head. So when you move LEFT, both head and next segment shift LEFT.

Wait so after first move:

- Head: (7,4)
- Next segment: from previous position was at (8,5) → moved to (7,5)

So snake is [(7,4), (7,5)].

Second move: LEFT again. Now:

- Head moves left to (6,4)
- Next segment from (7,4) moves left to (6,5).

Now snake is [(6,4), (6,5)].

Third move: DOWN from (6,4):

- Head moves down to (6,3)
- Next segment at (6,5) moves down to (5,5)

Now snake is [(6,3), (5,5)]

Wait, so now we're at position (6,3). But the apple is at (6,0).

Next steps:

Fourth move: DOWN from (6,3):

- Head → (6,2)
- Next segment from (5,5) moves to (4,5)

Fifth move: DOWN:

- Head → (6,1)
- Next segment from (4,5) moves down to (3,5)

Sixth move: DOWN:

- Head → (6,0)
- Now apple is at (6,0). So we've reached the target.

So that seems safe. Did any of these steps cause collision?

Let me check each step's positions:

1. Move 1: head from (8,4) to (7,4); body from (8,5) → (7,5)
   No collision as they're both free spaces.

2. Move 2: head from (7,4) → (6,4); body segments move from (7,5) → (6,5). Both new positions are (6,4) and (6,5), which were empty in the original grid? Assuming no walls yet, but need to check if these positions are valid.

Wait the problem says coordinates can be anything as long as they're within bounds. So for example, at step 1:

After first move, new head is (7,4). Body was (8,5) moves left to (7,5).

Now moving again LEFT: head goes from (7,4) → (6,4); body's previous position (7,5) becomes (6,5). So no collision.

After second move, snake is [(6,4), (6,5)]. Next steps:

Third move: DOWN to (6,3). The previous segments were at (6,4), so now they become (5,4)? Wait wait—no. After each move, all body parts shift in the direction of movement.

Wait no—if you have a two-segment snake and each segment shifts along with the head:

After second move: [(6,4), (6,5)]

Third move: DOWN

- Head moves to (6,3)
- Next segment from (6,4) → down to (5,4)

So new body is [(6,3), (5,4)]

Wait that makes sense.

Fourth move: DOWN:

- Head: (6,2)
- Body's previous position was at (5,4); now moves to (4,4).

No collision here. Snake is [(6,2), (4,4)].

Fifth move: DOWN again:

- Head → (6,1)
- Body from (4,4) → (3,4)

Sixth move: DOWN:

- Head → (6,0)
- Body from (3,4) → (2,4)

So all positions are unique and within bounds. Therefore, this path seems valid.

Thus, the sequence of moves would be:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN

But wait—step 3: moving from (6,4) to (6,3). After step 2's move, snake is at [(6,4), (6,5)]. So when moving down, the head goes to (6,3), and body moves from (6,5) → (5,5).

Wait no—that contradicts previous thought. Earlier I thought after second move:

After two LEFTs: snake is [(6,4), (6,5)].

Then step 3: moving DOWN from (6,4). Wait but wait—no, because in the second move, we moved LEFT again to get to (6,4); then when trying to move DOWN, that would be from position (6,4) to (6,3), and body segments shift down.

But I'm getting confused with how each step affects the snake's positions. Maybe an alternative way is to write down each state after each move:

Initial State: [(8,4), (8,5)]

Move 1: LEFT → new head at (7,4); body moves from (8,5) to (7,5). So now snake is [(7,4), (7,5)].

Move 2: LEFT again. Head becomes (6,4); previous head position (7,4) → moves to (6,5). Snake now at [(6,4), (6,5)].

Move 3: DOWN from (6,4)→ (6,3); body's (6,5) → down to (5,5). Now snake is [(6,3), (5,5)]

Move 4: DOWN. Head becomes (6,2); previous head position at (6,3) moves to (5,3). Snake is now [(6,2), (5,3)].

Move 5: DOWN. Head →(6,1); body from (5,3)→(4,3). Snake is [(6,1), (4,3)]

Move 6: DOWN. Head→(6,0); body from (4,3)→(3,3). Now snake at [(6,0), (3,3)].

But apple is at (6,0)—so when the head reaches (6,0), the apple is there; so we don't need to move further. So yes, it's valid.

Therefore, the moves are:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN

So total of six moves: two LEFTs followed by four Downs.
</think>

The snake can navigate to reach the apple by making a series of moves without colliding with itself or going out of bounds.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake's head is at (8,4), and its body segment is at (8,5).

2. **Move 1 - LEFT:** The head moves from (8,4) to (7,4). The body segment follows, moving from (8,5) to (7,5). No collision occurs.

3. **Move 2 - LEFT:** The head moves from (7,4) to (6,4). The previous head position at (7,4) shifts left to (6,5), and the body is now [(6,4), (6,5)].

4. **Move 3 - DOWN:** The head moves down from (6,4) to (6,3). The body segment that was at (6,5) shifts down to (5,5). Now, the snake's position is [(6,3), (5,5)].

5. **Move 4 - DOWN:** The head descends from (6,3) to (6,2). The previous head position (6,3) moves down to (5,3). Snake now at [(6,2), (5,3)].

6. **Move 5 - DOWN:** The head goes down to (6,1); the body part from (5,3) shifts down to (4,3). Snake is [(6,1), (4,3)].

7. **Move 6 - DOWN:** Finally, the head moves to (6,0), which coincides with the apple's position, and the body segment from (4,3) shifts down to (3,3).

**Final Answer:**

The snake can reach the apple by making two LEFT turns followed by four DOWN movements. The sequence of moves is as follows:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN

So, the directions are: LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

$\boxed{\text{LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN}}$
