========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 5 times to reach the apple at (1,1) from (6,1) (same y-coordinate). Each left move avoids collisions with the vertical body segment (initially at (6,2)-(6,5)) as the body shifts leftward. After each move, the body follows without overlapping the new head. The final left move reaches the apple, and the snake can safely move up next (no immediate trapping)."
