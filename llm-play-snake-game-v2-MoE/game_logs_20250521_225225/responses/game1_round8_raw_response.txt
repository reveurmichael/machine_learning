========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out how to get the snake from (7,6) to eat the apple at (5,6). The snake's head is currently there, moving left would take it towards the apple since x decreases by 1 each move. But wait, direction can't reverse on the first move. So if it was going right before, now it's LEFT. But in this case, from (7,6), to get closer to (5,6) which is two units left, moving LEFT twice should work.

Looking at body cells: [(8,6)], so the snake occupies (7,6), then next segment is (8,6). So when moving LEFT, the new head would be (6,6). Is that position free? Yes, because (6,6) isn't in the body. Also, check if it's within bounds: 0 â‰¤ x,y <10.

So move LEFT once to get closer, and then again. Each time checking for collisions with body or walls. Since after first LEFT, the snake becomes [(7,6), (8,6)] moving to (6,6). Then next move would be another LEFT to (5,6). At that point, the snake's head is at apple's position.

But I have to make sure that when it eats the apple, it doesn't get trapped. After eating, tail remains unless eaten again. So after moving LEFT twice, the body will be [(7,6), (8,6), (5,6)]. Then next move must not lead to a dead end. The next possible moves should be such that there's at least one legal direction left.

Also considering Manhattan distance: from (7,6) to (5,6) is 2 units left and same y. So the number of LEFTs minus RIGHTs should equal 2, which will happen with two LEFTs. The UP and DOWN moves difference is zero because y remains same. 

I think moving LEFT twice directly towards the apple is safe without reversing direction on first move. Let's plan that.
