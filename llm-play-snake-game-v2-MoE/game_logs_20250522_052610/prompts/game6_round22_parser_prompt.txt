You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's break down how I approached solving this Snake problem. 

First, I looked at the current state of the game. The snake's head is at (3,7), and it needs to reach the apple at (0,7). The body cells are [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)], so the snake is currently moving upwards along the same x-coordinate as the apple.

I considered the movement rules. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN to avoid reversing. I started by planning a path that goes directly towards the apple without unnecessary detours.

The apple is to the left of the head, so I needed to make LEFT moves. However, because the snake's body is in front, moving LEFT initially might cause collision. So, I first moved UP once to extend the body and get out of the way.

After that, it's safe to move LEFT three times to reach x=0. Throughout this path, I made sure that each move doesn't collide with the body or go out of bounds. Also, after eating the apple, I ensured there was at least one legal move left to avoid traps.

Finally, I checked the required moves to ensure the number of LEFTs and UPs/RIGHTs/DOWNS matched the Manhattan distance constraints.

{
  "moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake first moves up to extend its body safely, then moves left three times to reach the apple at (0,7) without colliding with itself or going out of bounds."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)], to eat the apple at (0, 7).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
