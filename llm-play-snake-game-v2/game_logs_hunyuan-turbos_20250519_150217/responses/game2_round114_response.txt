  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move left to decrease the x-coordinate from 7 to 6 and up to increase the y-coordinate from 2 to 8. The first move is LEFT to avoid reversing direction and to start aligning with the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent moves prioritize moving UP to reach the apple's y-coordinate while avoiding collisions with the body."
