========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to move the snake from (9,9) to eat the apple at (9,4). Let's see. The current direction is "RIGHT", and the body cells are [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]. 

First, I need to understand where the snake is currently. The head is at (9,9). Since the direction is "RIGHT", the next move can't be "LEFT" because that would reverse the direction. So from RIGHT, the allowed moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

Looking at the body cells, they start at (8,9) and go down to (5,6). The snake's tail is at (5,6), but I need to check if moving in a certain direction would cause the head to collide with any of these body parts except maybe the tail when it moves.

The apple is at (9,4), which is directly below the head. Wait, no—coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So y increases upwards. So (9,4) is 5 units down from (9,9). So I need to move the snake's head downward.

But wait, if the current direction is "RIGHT", which moves the x-coordinate up. But since we're at x=9, moving right would take us off the grid because x can't be more than 9. Oh, no, in the problem statement, "RIGHT" means x+1, so from (9,9), moving RIGHT would take us to (10,9), which is outside the grid—so that's a collision and death.

Wait, but the current direction is "RIGHT", so I can't move LEFT because of rule 2. So first, let me check what directions are allowed after the initial move. Since current direction is RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But moving right from (9,9) is invalid. So only UP and DOWN are options for the first move.

Wait, but the head is at (9,9). If I choose to move DOWN, that would take it to (9,8). But wait, y decreases when moving down because "DOWN" is y-1. So from (9,9), moving DOWN takes me to (9,8).

But let's check if this new_head collides with any body cells except possibly the tail.

The body cells after the head are [(8,9), (7,9), etc.] so at (8,9) is the first body cell. If I move DOWN to (9,8), does that collide? The body doesn't include (9,8), so it's safe.

So moving DOWN from (9,9) to (9,8) seems safe as the first move.

But let me make sure. After the move, the new_head is (9,8). Then, we update the body: insert old head (9,9) at front of BODY. So body becomes [(9,9), (8,9), ... , (5,6)]. Since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail, so the new body is [(9,9), (8,9), ..., (6,6)].

Wait no—after inserting old head at front, the body is now [old_head] + current_body. Then, if not eating, remove last element (tail). So initial body was 7 elements; after moving, it's still 7? Wait, initial body has 7 cells: from (8,9) to (5,6). So inserting old head makes it 8 cells, then removing tail brings back to 7. But in this case, since we didn't eat the apple, yes.

So after moving DOWN, the new head is at (9,8), and body includes (9,9), (8,9), etc., down to (6,6). 

Now, what's next? From (9,8), direction was DOWN from previous move. So now current direction is DOWN. Next moves can't be UP because that would reverse the direction.

The apple is at (9,4), so we need to keep moving DOWN as much as possible.

So second move: continue moving DOWN to (9,7). But wait, let's check if this is safe. The new_head after moving DOWN from (9,8) is (9,7). Check if it's in any body cells except the tail when it moves.

The current body after first move is [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (6,6), (5,6)]. Wait no—after inserting old head at front and removing tail, the new body after first move would be:

Old head: (9,9)
Body before moving: [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]
After inserting old head at front: [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]
Then remove tail because we didn't eat apple. So new body is [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)].

So the tail after first move is (6,6). When moving again, the tail will shift as well.

Now, when moving from (9,8) to (9,7): new_head is (9,7). We need to check if any body cells except the new tail position (which is about to be removed or shifted) are in this cell.

The current body after first move includes (9,9), (8,9), etc., but not (9,7). So it's safe. 

So second move is DOWN again, taking head to (9,7).

Now, the apple is at (9,4), which is still three moves down.

Next, from (9,7), current direction is DOWN. So next possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN? Wait no—current direction is DOWN, so can't choose UP next. So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or same DOWN.

But we need to keep moving towards the apple, which is straight down. But let's see: from (9,7), moving DOWN would take us to (9,6). Check if that's safe.

The body after second move:

After first two moves, body is [(9,9) inserted at front each time? Wait no—each move inserts the old head into the body and then removes tail unless eating apple.

Wait, let me clarify: Each move, when you compute new_head, then update the body by inserting the previous head as the new BODY1. Then, if not eating apple, remove the last element (tail). So after each move, the body length remains the same unless eating apple.

In our case, so far, we haven't eaten the apple yet because it's at (9,4), and we're moving towards it step by step.

So, from (9,7) in direction DOWN, new_head is (9,6). 

Check collisions: (9,6) is not in body cells after first two moves. The body after first move was [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)], and after second move, it would be inserting (9,8) at front, then removing tail: so new body is [(9,8), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)]. Wait, no—the body updates each time by inserting the previous head.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step:

1. Initial state:
   - Head: (9,9)
   - Direction: RIGHT
   - Body cells: [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]
   
2. First move: DOWN to (9,8).
   - New head: (9,8)
   - Insert old head (9,9) into body front → new body starts as [(9,9)] + previous body: [(8,9), ... , (5,6)].
   - Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element. So new body is [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)].

3. Second move: DOWN to (9,7).
   - New head: (9,7)
   - Insert old head (9,8) into body front → [(9,8)] + previous body: [(9,9), (8,9), ... , (6,6)]
   - Remove last element. So new body is [(9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)].

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because inserting the old head each time changes the order. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the body list after each move is:

After first move: [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)].

Then, second move: insert (9,8) at front → new body starts as [ (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), ... ] but then remove the tail. So it becomes [ (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6) ].

So when moving from (9,7), new_head is (9,6). Check if this collides with any body cells except the tail. The body after second move includes (9,8), (9,9), etc., but not (9,6). So it's safe.

But wait, looking at the body after second move: [ (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6) ]. The last cell is (7,6). When we move to (9,6), that's not in the body. So safe.

So third move: DOWN again to (9,6).

Now, check if this new_head (9,6) collides with any body cells except possibly the new tail when it moves. The current body after third move would be:

Insert old head (9,7) at front → [ (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), ... ] then remove last element. So new body is [ (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7) ].

The apple is at (9,4). We're now at (9,6). Next move: DOWN to (9,5).

Check collision. The body after third move is [ (9,7), ... , (7,7) ]. So (9,5) is not in the body, safe.

Fourth move: DOWN to (9,5).

Body after fourth move:

Insert (9,6) at front → [ (9,6), (9,7), ... ] then remove last element. New body is [ (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8) ].

Now, moving from (9,5) to (9,4). 

Check collision: new_head is (9,4). The body after fourth move includes cells up to (7,8), so no collision. So safe.

Fifth move: DOWN to (9,4), which is the apple's position.

Wait, but when we reach (9,4), do we eat the apple? Yes. So in this case, when we compute new_head as (9,4), since it's where the apple is, we need to check if any of the body cells except the tail would be at (9,4). 

But after four moves, the body would have been updated each time by inserting the old head and removing the tail. So let me see:

After fifth move: new_head is (9,4). Body before moving was [ (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8) ].

Inserting old head (9,5) at front → [ (9,5), (9,6), ... , (7,8) ], then since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So body becomes 8 cells now: [ (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8) ].

But wait, in this case, when moving to (9,4), the body doesn't include (9,4), so it's safe. So we can eat the apple here.

So after five moves of DOWN, starting from (9,9), down to (9,8), then 7,6,5,4—reaching the apple.

But let me check if there are any obstacles in this path. From (9,9) down: (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4). Each step seems clear because the body doesn't include these positions until maybe the tail starts moving.

Wait, after each move, the body includes the previous head as a new cell. So after five moves, the body would be long enough that perhaps some cells are in the way?

Wait, let's see: After first move to (9,8), body is [ (9,9), (8,9), ... ].

After second move to (9,7), body is [ (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), ... ].

Third move to (9,6): body [ (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), ... ].

Fourth move to (9,5): body [ (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), ... ].

Fifth move to (9,4): body would be [ (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), ... ] up to 8 cells.

Wait, but when moving from (9,5) to (9,4), the new_head is (9,4). The body after inserting old head (9,5) would have cells including (9,5), (9,6), etc., but not (9,4) except for the tail.

But since we're eating the apple at this step, do we check if any body cell (except maybe the tail when it moves) is at (9,4)?

I think in this case, the body after four moves doesn't include (9,4), so moving to (9,4) is safe. So five moves of DOWN would work.

But let me double-check each step:

1. Move 1: DOWN from (9,9) → (9,8). Safe.
2. Move 2: DOWN from (9,8) → (9,7). Safe.
3. Move 3: DOWN from (9,7) → (9,6). Safe.
4. Move 4: DOWN from (9,6) → (9,5). Safe.
5. Move 5: DOWN from (9,5) → (9,4). Eat apple.

Each step is safe because the body doesn't include those cells until after the move, and since we're eating the apple on the fifth move, the body expands without removing the tail.

So the sequence of moves would be five times DOWN. But let's see if there's a shorter path or any issues I might have missed.

Wait, but from (9,9), moving down to (9,8) is allowed because it's not colliding with any body cells except possibly the tail when it shifts. But as checked earlier, it's safe.

Another thing: After eating the apple on the fifth move, does the snake grow? Because in this problem, when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail; you keep the new head and all previous parts. So the body length increases by one each time you eat.

Wait no—in the initial description, it's not clear whether eating an apple makes the snake grow or not. But from the move update process, if you eat an apple, you add a cell without removing the tail, thus growing longer.

But in our case, since we're moving directly towards the apple and there's nothing blocking us, except for the body cells which are behind and won't reach (9,4) before we get there.

Wait, another thought: After each move, the snake's body shifts. So when moving down multiple times, the body follows, but does it create a loop that might block the head?

Let me visualize:

- Initial position: Head at (9,9), body trailing to (5,6).

After first DOWN:
Head at (9,8), body cells [ (9,9), (8,9), ..., (6,6) ].

Wait no—initial body is [(8,9), ... , (5,6)]. After inserting (9,9) at front and removing tail, it's [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)].

Wait, that's seven cells. So from (9,8), the body is now [ (9,9), (8,9), ... , (6,6) ] which are all to the left and below the head.

When moving again DOWN, we go to (9,7). Inserting previous head (9,8) at front: [ (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), ..., (6,6) ]. Remove tail: becomes [ (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), ... , (7,6) ].

So as we keep moving DOWN, the body cells are shifting towards the right and down. But since we're moving straight down, there's no loop or collision with our own body except for the tail which is safely behind.

Thus, moving DOWN five times in a row should work.

But wait another thing: when you eat an apple, does the snake grow? If so, after eating at (9,4), the snake would have grown by four cells, but since we are going straight down, it's not causing any collision except perhaps for overlapping with itself. But as each step is in a straight line and the body follows behind, there should be no overlap until we reach the apple.

Therefore, the moves would be:

1. DOWN
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN

So five moves of DOWN.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to guide the snake from its starting position at (9, 9) directly down to the position of the apple located at (9, 4). The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. Each move shifts the snake's head one unit in the specified direction while the body follows behind.

### Approach
1. **Identify the Path**: The shortest path from the starting position to the apple is a straight line downward. This means moving the snake repeatedly downwards until it reaches the apple's position.
2. **Check for Collisions**: As the snake moves, we must ensure that its head does not collide with any part of its body. Since the snake is moving in a straight line and its body follows behind, there will be no collisions as long as each move is valid.
3. **Eating the Apple**: When the snake's head reaches the apple's position, it eats the apple and grows longer by one cell without losing any part of its body.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the sequence of moves needed for the snake to reach the apple.

def solve():
    # The snake starts at (9, 9) and needs to move down five times to reach (9, 4)
    moves = ["DOWN"] * 5
    return moves

# Example usage:
moves = solve()
print(moves)  # Output: ['DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN', 'DOWN']
```

### Explanation
- **Direction**: The snake needs to move down five times. Each "DOWN" move shifts the head one unit downward.
- **Path Safety**: Since the snake moves in a straight line and its body follows behind without overlapping, each move is safe until reaching the apple's position.
- **Growth**: Upon reaching the apple at (9, 4), the snake grows by one cell, ensuring it does not lose any part of its body.

This approach ensures that the snake efficiently reaches the apple with minimal moves and no self-collisions.
