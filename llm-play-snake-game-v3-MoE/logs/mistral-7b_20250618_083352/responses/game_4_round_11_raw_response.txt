========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

 {
     "moves": ["LEFT", "UP"],
     "reasoning": "The snake is currently at (6,7) and needs to move left towards the apple at (3,2). Since it cannot reverse direction on the first move, we choose 'LEFT' first, which takes us to (5,7). From there, moving 'UP' twice gets us to the apple position at (3,5), then one more 'DOWN' and 'RIGHT' will get the snake to its final destination."
