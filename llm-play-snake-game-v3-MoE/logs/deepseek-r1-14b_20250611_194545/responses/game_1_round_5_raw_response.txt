========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from (3,7) to eat the apple at (4,7). The current direction is "UP", and the body cells are [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]. So the head is at (3,7), and the body behind it is a straight line down to (3,4), then the tail moves to (4,4).

First, I need to make sure that the snake doesn't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is "UP", the next move can't be "DOWN". So possible directions are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or stay "UP".

Looking at the target apple at (4,7), which is one cell to the right of the head. That suggests that moving "RIGHT" would directly get the snake to the apple.

But I need to check if that's safe. Let's simulate the move:

1. New head position: (3+1,7) = (4,7). That's exactly where the apple is.
2. Check for collisions: The new head is at (4,7). Now, looking at the body cells before moving. The current body starts with (3,6), then (3,5), etc. So none of these are at (4,7) except maybe after movement.

Wait, but according to the rules, when checking collisions, we consider the state before any body shifts. So in this case, the new head is being checked against the current body positions. The body cells are [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]. None of these are at (4,7), so no collision there.

Next, since it's an apple move, we grow the snake without removing the tail. So after moving right, the new head is (4,7). The body will now have the old head added to the front: [(3,7)] + current body. But wait, the current body is [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)], so adding (3,7) in front makes it [(3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]. Then, since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So the body becomes longer by one.

Now, after this move, the new head is at (4,7). The next step would be to ensure that there's a legal move possible, as per the rules. But for now, eating the apple seems safe because the collision checks passed and we didn't reverse direction.

So, moving "RIGHT" is valid and leads directly to the apple without any issues.
