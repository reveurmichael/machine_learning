========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to guide the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (5,3). The snake's current direction is "NONE," which means it can choose any initial direction without worrying about reversing. 

First, let's think about the apple's position relative to the head. It's directly two cells below the head since both are on x=5. So moving down twice should work if there's a clear path.

But wait, I need to check if moving down is possible without causing any collisions. The current body of the snake includes (4,3) and other segments that are blocking my way. If I move down each time, will the snake collide with its own body?

Looking at the movement rules, when the head moves, we have to ensure it doesn't land on any body segment except possibly the tail if it's about to grow. Since the apple is adjacent but not yet reached, moving down should be safe as long as there's space.

I'll plan two moves: first "DOWN" and then another "DOWN." This will move the head from (5,5) to (5,4) after the first move and then to (5,3), where the apple is. I need to verify that these movements don't result in any collisions with body segments.

Considering the body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), etc.], moving down doesn't seem to interfere because those are two rows away. So after each move, the snake's body will shift forward without overlapping.

Also, since I'm not reversing direction initially, it follows the rules. The final path should have zero horizontal moves and a net of -2 vertical moves (since y decreases by 2). That matches the required condition.

I think this plan is safe and avoids any immediate collisions or grid issues.
