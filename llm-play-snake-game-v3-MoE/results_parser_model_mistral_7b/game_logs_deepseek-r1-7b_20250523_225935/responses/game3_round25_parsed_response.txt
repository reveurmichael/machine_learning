{"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake needs to move left three times and then down five times. The first three moves are left because the snake is currently at (2, 9) and moving left would bring it closer to the apple at (2, 4). After reaching (2, 5), the snake turns down and moves down again to reach the apple."}
