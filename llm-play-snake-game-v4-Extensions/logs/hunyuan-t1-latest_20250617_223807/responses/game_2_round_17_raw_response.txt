========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (4,9) with direction RIGHT. To reach the apple at (2,2), the snake needs to move left (2 steps) and down (7 steps). The body blocks x=3 (except (3,9) which is adjacent to the head), so moving left directly is initially unsafe. Moving down first avoids collisions, as the head moves to (4,8), (4,7), ..., (4,2) (7 downs), which are all outside the body. After reaching (4,2), moving left to (3,2) and then (2,2) (apple) is safe, as these positions are not occupied by the body. After eating the apple, the snake can move up, down, or left next, ensuring no immediate trapping."
