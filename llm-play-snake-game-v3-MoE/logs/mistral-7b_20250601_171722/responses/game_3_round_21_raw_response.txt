    "moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT"],
    "reasoning": "To avoid immediate self-collision and to keep the snake's movement continuous, we first move left, then move up to clear the path. Since the snake is currently positioned above the apple (y1 > y2), we need to move up #(y1 - y2) = 5 times. Finally, we move left once to reach the apple."
