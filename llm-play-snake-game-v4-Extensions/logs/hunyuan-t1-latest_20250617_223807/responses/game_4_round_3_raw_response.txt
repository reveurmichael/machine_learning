========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right to reach the apple at (9,6) but must first navigate around its body. Starting with UP avoids immediate collision and shifts the body. Subsequent RIGHT moves shift the head rightward, then DOWN clears the path, and finally RIGHT reaches the apple. After eating, a DOWN move remains safe, ensuring no immediate trapping."
