{"moves": ["down", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left"], "reasoning": "The agent starts at (8, 9). To reach the apple at (0, 8) without colliding with its body, the agent first moves down to (8, 8), then moves left 8 times. This path is safe because each subsequent move keeps the head at a position not occupied by the body."}
