========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,3) with direction LEFT. First, moving UP to (5,4) avoids body collisions and moves closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Next, moving UP to (5,5) continues approaching the apple. Finally, moving LEFT to (4,5) reaches the apple. After eating, the snake can move DOWN next, ensuring no immediate trapping. This path aligns with the required net moves (2 UP, 1 LEFT)."
