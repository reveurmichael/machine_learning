  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The shortest path involves moving directly down the left column from (0,9) to (0,1), as all cells below are unoccupied and safe. After eating the apple, the head at (0,1) has legal moves to (0,0) or (1,1), avoiding self-trapping."
