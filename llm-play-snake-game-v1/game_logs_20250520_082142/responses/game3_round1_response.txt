Let's analyze the current game state and plan a path to the apple at (8, 1) from the snake head at (5, 5).

Current constraints:
1. The snake has no body segments (just the head), so we only need to avoid walls
2. The head has no current direction, so we can choose any initial direction
3. The apple is at (8, 1) - 3 rows down and 4 columns left from the head

Optimal path considerations:
- We need to move left first to align with the apple's column
- Then move down to reach the apple's row
- We should avoid getting stuck in corners

Here's a safe sequence of moves to reach the apple:

1. LEFT (to column 4)
2. LEFT (to column 3)
3. LEFT (to column 2)
4. LEFT (to column 1) - now aligned with apple's column
5. DOWN (to row 6)
6. DOWN (to row 7)
7. DOWN (to row 8) - reaches apple at (8,1)

This sequence is 7 moves long and safely navigates to the apple without any risk of collision. The path moves left first to align with the apple's column, then moves straight down to reach it.

Alternative paths would be possible (like moving down first then left), but this sequence is efficient and keeps the snake away from walls until it reaches the apple.
