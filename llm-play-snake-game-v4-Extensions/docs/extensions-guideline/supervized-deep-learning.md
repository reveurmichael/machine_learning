# Supervised Deep Learning in Snake Game AI Project

This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing supervised learning models for Snake Game AI, covering neural networks, tree-based models, and advanced deep learning architectures.

## 🎯 **Supervised Learning Overview**

The project implements multiple supervised learning approaches to train agents using datasets generated from heuristic algorithms:

### **Model Categories:**

#### **Neural Networks (PyTorch)**
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: Foundation neural network for move prediction
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Spatial feature extraction from game grids
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: Sequential decision making with memory
- **GNN (Graph Neural Network)**: Relationship modeling using graph structures

#### **Advanced Architectures**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: Efficient sequence modeling
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Long-term dependency learning
- **Transformer**: Attention-based sequence-to-sequence modeling

#### **Tree-Based Models**
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for structured data
- **LightGBM**: Fast gradient boosting with categorical features
- **CatBoost**: Categorical feature handling without preprocessing
