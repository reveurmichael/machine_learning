========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

 {
      "moves": ["UP", "UP"],
      "reasoning": "Since the head is currently at (5,2), moving UP twice will take us to the apple's row. The reasoning behind this decision is that there are no initial collisions with walls or bodies due to the snake's movement rules. Additionally, this path does not involve reversing direction and ensures continuous body placement after each move."
