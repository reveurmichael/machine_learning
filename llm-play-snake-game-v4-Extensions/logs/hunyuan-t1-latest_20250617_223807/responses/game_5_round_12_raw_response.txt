========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left (6 times) and up (1 time) to reach the apple at (1,7) from (7,6). Starting with UP avoids reversing the initial RIGHT direction. Subsequent LEFT moves are safe as they avoid the snake's body, which shifts leftward each turn. The final LEFT move reaches the apple, and the snake can continue moving LEFT afterward without collision."
