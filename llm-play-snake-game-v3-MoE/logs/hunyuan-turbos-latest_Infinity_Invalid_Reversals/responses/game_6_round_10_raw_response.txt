Wait, but let's analyze more carefully. The current head is at (1,0), direction is LEFT, and body is [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)]. The apple is at (4,8).

The snake cannot reverse direction (from LEFT to RIGHT is allowed, since reversing would be from LEFT to RIGHT is not a reverseâ€”LEFT's reverse is RIGHT, but the rule says you cannot reverse, so LEFT cannot choose RIGHT? Wait, no: the rule says "cannot reverse": if current direction is UP, cannot choose DOWN; if LEFT, cannot choose RIGHT; etc. So from LEFT, cannot choose RIGHT. So the first move cannot be RIGHT.

So the first move must be UP or DOWN. But DOWN would take the head to (1,-1), which is out of bounds. So first move must be UP.

So first move is UP: new head is (1,1). Now the body shifts: old head (1,0) is added to the front of the body, making the body [(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)], then the tail (6,2) is removed (since not eating apple), so new body is [(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1)].

Now the head is at (1,1), direction is UP (since first move was UP). Now, possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot go DOWN, as that's reverse of UP).

Next, to move towards the apple, we need to increase x and y. So possible moves are UP, RIGHT.

Let's choose RIGHT: new head is (2,1). Check if (2,1) is in the body: body is [(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1)]. (2,1) is not in the body, so safe. Now, body shifts: old head (1,1) is added to front, making body [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1)], then tail (6,1) is removed (not eating apple), so new body is [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0)].

Head is now at (2,1), direction is RIGHT. Next moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN (cannot go LEFT, reverse of RIGHT).

Choose UP: new head is (2,2). Check body: [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0)]. (2,2) is not in body, safe. Body shifts: old head (2,1) added to front, body becomes [(2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0)], tail (6,0) removed, new body is [(2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)].

Head at (2,2), direction UP. Next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot DOWN).

Choose UP: new head (2,3). Body shifts: old head (2,2) added to front, body becomes [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)], tail (5,0) removed, new body is [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)].

Head at (2,3), direction UP. Next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot DOWN).

Choose UP: new head (2,4). Body shifts: old head (2,3) added to front, body becomes [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)], tail (4,0) removed, new body is [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)].

Head at (2,4), direction UP. Next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot DOWN).

Choose UP: new head (2,5). Body shifts: old head (2,4) added to front, body becomes [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)], tail (3,0) removed, new body is [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)].

Head at (2,5), direction UP. Next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot DOWN).

Choose UP: new head (2,6). Body shifts: old head (2,5) added to front, body becomes [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)], tail (2,0) removed, new body is [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0)].

Head at (2,6), direction UP. Next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot DOWN).

Choose UP: new head (2,7). Body shifts: old head (2,6) added to front, body becomes [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0)], tail (1,0) removed, new body is [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1)].

Head at (2,7), direction UP. Next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (cannot DOWN).

Choose UP: new head (2,8). Body shifts: old head (2,7) added to front, body becomes [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1)], tail (1,1) removed, new body is [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)].

Head at (2,8), direction UP. Now, the apple is at (4,8). We need to move right twice to reach x=4. So next moves: RIGHT, RIGHT.

Choose RIGHT: new head (3,8). Body shifts: old head (2,8) added to front, body becomes [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)], tail (2,1) removed, new body is [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)].

Head at (3,8), direction RIGHT. Next moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN (cannot LEFT).

Choose RIGHT: new head (4,8). This is the apple position. Body shifts: old head (3,8) added to front, body becomes [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)], tail (2,2) is NOT removed (since eating apple), so new body is [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,2)]? Wait, no: when eating apple, the tail is not removed. So the body becomes the old body with the old head added to the front, and the tail is not removed. So new body is [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]? Wait, no: the body before this move was [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)], and we add (3,8) to the front, making it [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)], and the tail is not removed, so the body remains the same length plus one (since we didn't remove the tail). So the new body is [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]? No, the body before was length 7 (from (2,8) to (2,1)), and we add (3,8) to the front, making it length 8, and we don't remove the tail, so the new body is [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]. But the tail was (2,1), and it's not removed, so the body is now length 9. But the snake's length increases by 1 when eating apple, which is correct.

Now the head is at (4,8), and the apple is eaten. The body is now longer, and we have to ensure there's at least one legal move next turn. The current direction is RIGHT. Possible moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN (cannot LEFT). 

But the problem only asks for moves to reach the apple, not beyond. So the moves to reach the apple are: first move UP (to avoid reversing from LEFT), then UP seven times to reach y=8, then RIGHT twice to reach x=4. So total moves: UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT.

But the initial first move cannot be RIGHT (reverse of LEFT), so the first move is UP. Then the sequence is as above.

Thus, the moves are: ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"].

But the sample output had a different sequence. Maybe the sample output is incorrect or suboptimal. The correct sequence should be as above.

But the sample output was:

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right to increase its x-coordinate and up to increase its y-coordinate to reach the apple. The initial moves avoid the body and stay within bounds."
}

But the first move cannot be RIGHT (reverse of LEFT), so the sample output is invalid. Thus, the correct answer is:

{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake must first move UP to avoid reversing from LEFT, then move UP seven times to reach the apple's y-coordinate, then move RIGHT twice to reach the apple's x-coordinate."
}

Final answer:

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake must first move UP to avoid reversing from LEFT, then move UP seven times to reach the apple's y-coordinate, then move RIGHT twice to reach the apple's x-coordinate."
}
