========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (7,9) to eat the apple at (6,9). 

First, I'll look at the current state. The head is at (7,9), which is the top-right corner of the grid. The body cells are [(7,8), (7,7), ..., (7,1)], so the snake is a vertical line along x=7 from y=1 up to y=9. That's quite a long snake.

The current direction is "UP". So, the head can't move "DOWN" because that would be reversing direction. The possible initial moves are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or continue "UP".

The apple is at (6,9), which is directly to the left of the head. So, from (7,9), moving "LEFT" will take the head to (6,9) and eat the apple.

But I need to check for collisions. After moving "LEFT" to (6,9), does this new head position collide with any body cells except possibly the tail? The current body starts at (7,8), so no, because (6,9) is not in the body list. Also, after moving, since we ate the apple, the snake grows by one cell. So the body will now include the old head (7,9) and all previous body cells.

Wait, but when we move "LEFT", the new head is (6,9). The current body is [(7,8), ...], so the new head doesn't collide with any body segments because they are all along x=7. So it's safe to move left immediately.

However, I should also consider whether after eating, there's at least one legal move next turn. After eating, the snake grows, but since the apple was right next to the head, moving left is the only way. But then, what directions are possible? The direction after eating would be "LEFT", so next move can't reverse, meaning we can't go back to "RIGHT". So from (6,9), possible moves are "UP" or "DOWN" or "LEFT" again.

But since there's an apple at (6,9) and the snake is now longer, I think moving left is safe for the first step.
</think>

The snake can safely move LEFT to eat the apple without any collision risks. 

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) directly reaches the apple without any collision as no body part occupies that cell."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 9) and whose body cells are in list format [(7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (6, 9). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
