<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (7,6) to eat the apple at (7,1). Let's break this down step by step.

First, the snake is currently facing "UP" with its head at (7,6). The body of the snake is just one segment behind it at (7,5). So the snake is two segments long: head at (7,6), and body at (7,5).

The apple is directly below the head on the same x-coordinate. Since y decreases as we go down, the apple is at (7,1), which is much lower than the current position of the head.

I need to plan a path that allows the snake to move down towards the apple without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds. Also, I have to remember that after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so I should make sure there's enough space for that and that it doesn't trap itself.

Starting from (7,6), since the current direction is "UP", I can't immediately go "DOWN" because of the no-reverse rule. Wait, no—the no-reverse rule says you can't choose the opposite direction of the current one. So if the current direction is "UP", next move can't be "DOWN". But in this case, the current direction is given as "UP", but I think that refers to the last movement. However, when the snake's body moves, the direction changes based on the new head position.

Wait, no—the current direction is provided as part of the input, so it's possible that the snake was moving "UP" before this move. So for the first move, can I choose any direction except the opposite? Wait, the rules say you can't reverse. So if the current direction is "UP", next move can't be "DOWN". But in this case, the initial direction is given as "UP", but that's just the current state; when planning the moves, each subsequent move must not be the reverse of the previous one.

Wait no—the movement rules say you cannot choose a direction that would cause the snake to reverse. So if the current direction is "UP", next can't be "DOWN". But in this case, since I'm starting with the head at (7,6) and body at (7,5), which suggests the snake was moving up to get there. Wait no—if the body is behind the head, then if the head is at (7,6) and the body is at (7,5), that means the snake's last movement was "UP" because it moved from (7,5) to (7,6). So the current direction is "UP".

So for the first move, I can't choose "DOWN". But wait, no—the current direction in the input is given as "UP", but when planning the moves, each subsequent move must follow the rule that you can't reverse. Wait, no—the movement rules state: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for others. So if I'm moving in a certain direction, the next move can't be the opposite.

Wait, but wait—no. The rule says you cannot reverse. So if your current direction is "UP", you can't choose "DOWN" as the next move. Similarly, "LEFT" and "RIGHT" can't be chosen if the current was their opposites.

But in this case, for the initial move, since the snake's current direction is "UP", I cannot choose "DOWN". Wait no—the movement rules say that you cannot reverse on the next move. So if the current direction is "UP", the next move can't be "DOWN".

Wait no—looking back at the movement rules: point 2 says:

Cannot reverse: If current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed.

So in this case, the current direction is given as "UP", so the first move cannot be "DOWN".

Wait no—the initial state's current direction is "UP", but when I'm making a move now, the next move can't be "DOWN". So for the first move, from (7,6), if I choose "LEFT" or "RIGHT" or "UP", that's fine, except "DOWN" isn't allowed because it would reverse.

Wait no—the current direction is "UP"—so the previous movement was upwards. The next move can't be "DOWN".

But wait, no—current direction refers to the direction in which the head is moving. So if the snake is currently facing "UP", that means its head is pointing up, and the last move was likely "UP". So for the next move, I cannot choose "DOWN" as it would reverse.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The current direction refers to the direction the snake's head is facing, regardless of where it's moving now. Wait no—no, in the movement rules, when you make a move, that sets your new direction, and then next moves can't be reversed.

So for the first step, since the current direction is "UP", I can choose any direction except "DOWN".

Wait no—the rule says: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for others. So if my current direction is "UP", the next move cannot be "DOWN". But in this case, since the snake's head is at (7,6) and body is at (7,5), that suggests that the snake was moving up to get there—so the last movement was "UP".

So for the first move, I can't choose "DOWN" because it would reverse. So possible moves are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "UP". But if I go "UP" again, I might hit the top of the grid (since y ranges from 0 to 9; at y=6, moving up would take me to y=7, which is fine as long as it's within bounds. Wait no—the grid goes from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. So y increases as you go up.

So the head is at (7,6). If I move "UP", new_head would be (7,7), which is valid because y=7 is less than 9. But if I choose "LEFT" or "RIGHT", I have to make sure that those positions are within bounds and not colliding with the body.

Wait, but the initial body is at (7,5). So after moving in any direction except "DOWN", let's see:

If I move "UP": new_head = (7,7). Then check for collision: the body is at (7,5), which is two cells below the head. So no collision because the new_head isn't overlapping with any body segments except possibly if the body is in that position.

Wait no—the body list is [(7,5)], so after moving "UP", the new_head is (7,7). The body would then be updated: insert old head (7,6) at front of the body list, making it [ (7,6), (7,5) ]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple (apple is at (7,1)), we have to remove the tail, which is (7,5). So the new body would be just [(7,6)]. Wait no—the initial body is [(7,5)], so after inserting old head, it becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ], then since we didn't eat apple, we remove the last element (tail), which is (7,5). So new body is [ (7,6) ].

Wait no—the initial S is [HEAD (7,6), BODY1 (7,5)]. After moving "UP", new_head is (7,7). Then:

a. Insert old head (7,6) at front of the BODY list: so BODY becomes [(7,6), (7,5)].

b. Since new_head != apple position (which is (7,1)), we don't eat an apple, so we remove the tail (last element of BODY before this step). The original BODY was [ (7,5) ], and after inserting old head, it's [ (7,6), (7,5) ]. Then since no apple eaten, we remove the last element, which is (7,5). So new body is [ (7,6) ].

Wait no—the initial body is [ (7,5) ]. After step a, inserting old head makes it [ (7,6), (7,5) ], but since we didn't eat apple, in step c, we remove the last element of BODY after insertion. Wait no—step 3 says:

a. Insert old head at front of BODY ⇒ new body is [old_head] + current_body.

b. If new_head == apple, grow: do not remove tail.

c. Else, move normally: remove last element (tail).

So initial body is [ (7,5) ].

After inserting old head (7,6), the body becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ].

Since new_head is (7,7) and apple is at (7,1), not equal. So we remove last element (7,5). So new body is [ (7,6) ].

So after moving "UP", the snake's head is at (7,7), and body is just [(7,6)], making it two segments: head at (7,7), body at (7,6).

But wait, that can't be right because the initial snake was two segments: head at (7,6) and body at (7,5). So when moving "UP", new_head is (7,7), then old head (7,6) is added to the front of the body list, making it [ (7,6), (7,5) ], but since we didn't eat apple, remove last element (7,5), so body becomes [ (7,6) ].

Wait no—the initial body was [ (7,5) ]. After inserting old head at front, the body becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ]. Then since new_head != apple, we remove the last element, which is (7,5). So new body is just [ (7,6) ].

Wait that can't be right because then the snake would have head at (7,7), and body at (7,6), making it two segments: okay. Then next move could be "UP" again, but we have to check for collision with body.

Alternatively, perhaps moving "LEFT" or "RIGHT" is better.

Wait, let's consider the possible first moves:

1. Move "UP": new_head = (7,7). Check if this causes any collision. The body after movement would be [ (7,6) ] as above. So no collision because new_head is at (7,7), and body is at (7,6).

2. Move "LEFT": new_head = (6,6). Then check for collision: the body is currently at (7,5). After inserting old head (7,6) into the body list, it becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ]. Since new_head is (6,6), which isn't in the body list after insertion and removal of tail. Wait no—after moving "LEFT", the new_head is (6,6). Then insert old head (7,6) into body list: [ (7,6), (7,5) ]. Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element (7,5), so body becomes [ (7,6) ].

So after moving "LEFT", the snake's head is at (6,6), and body is at (7,6). Now, does this cause any collision? The new_head is at (6,6), which isn't in the body list (which is now [ (7,6) ]). So no collision.

3. Move "RIGHT": similar to "LEFT", new_head would be (8,6), and body becomes [ (7,6) ] after step c, so no collision.

So all three options are possible for the first move: "UP", "LEFT", or "RIGHT". But wait—the current direction is "UP", so I can't choose "DOWN" as the next move. So moving in any other direction is allowed.

But since the apple is directly below (same x, lower y), perhaps it's better to go down, but I can't because of the no-reverse rule if the current direction was "UP". Wait no—the current direction is "UP", so I can't choose "DOWN" as the next move. So I have to choose either "LEFT", "RIGHT", or stay "UP".

Wait no—if the current direction is "UP", the next move can't be "DOWN"—that's all. So if I'm facing up, I can't go down immediately.

So perhaps moving in a different direction first, then maneuvering towards the apple.

But maybe it's better to think about how to get the snake down as much as possible without getting stuck.

Wait, but if I move "UP" again, making the head at (7,7), then next moves can be "DOWN", but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps moving left or right and then down.

But wait, after the first move, say to "LEFT", new_head is at (6,6). Then in the next move, I could choose any direction except "RIGHT" because that would reverse if I'm facing "LEFT".

Wait no—the movement rules apply based on the current direction. So when you choose a direction, it becomes your new current direction for the next move.

So perhaps planning:

Move 1: LEFT to (6,6)

Then move 2: DOWN (since previous was LEFT; but wait, can't reverse? No—reversing would be from LEFT to RIGHT, or from RIGHT to LEFT. So moving DOWN is allowed after LEFT because it's not the opposite.

Wait no—the movement rules say you cannot choose a direction that reverses your current direction. So if I'm currently facing LEFT (after first move), next move can't be RIGHT. But moving DOWN is fine.

So perhaps:

Move 1: LEFT to (6,6)

Move 2: DOWN to (6,5)

But wait—the body after move 1 would be [ (7,6) ] because we removed the tail (7,5). Wait no—let's re-express the steps.

Wait, initial state:

HEAD: (7,6)

BODY: [ (7,5) ]

After moving LEFT:

new_head = (6,6)

Insert old head (7,6) into body list: BODY becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ]

Since new_head != apple, remove last element (7,5). So new body is [ (7,6) ].

So after move 1:

HEAD: (6,6)

BODY: [ (7,6) ]

Wait no—that can't be right. The body list after inserting the old head would be [ (7,6), (7,5) ], but since we didn't eat apple, we remove the last element, which is (7,5). So new body is [ (7,6) ].

So now, the snake's body is at (7,6), and head is at (6,6).

Now, for move 2: current direction is LEFT (since that was the last movement). Wait no—the current direction in the input is "UP", but after making a move, the new direction becomes whatever you chose. So if I moved LEFT, then the current direction is now LEFT.

So for move 2, can't choose RIGHT because it's reverse of LEFT.

So possible moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (but that would just make the head go further left).

But perhaps moving down is better to approach the apple.

Move 2: DOWN. new_head = (6,5)

Check for collision with body: current body after move 1 is [ (7,6) ], and inserting old head (6,6) into body list before step a.

Wait no—after each move, when you insert the old head into the body list, then remove the tail if not growing.

So after move 2:

new_head = (6,5)

Insert old head from previous step: which was (6,6). So body becomes [ (6,6), (7,6) ]

Since new_head != apple (which is at (7,1)), we remove the last element (7,6).

So new body is [ (6,6) ].

Wait no—the initial body after move 1 was [ (7,6) ]. Then in move 2, inserting old head (6,6) makes the body list [ (6,6), (7,6) ] before step c. Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element: (7,6). So new body is [ (6,6) ].

So after move 2:

HEAD: (6,5)

BODY: [ (6,6) ]

Now, no collision because head is at (6,5), and body is at (6,6).

Then for move 3: current direction was DOWN. So next move can't be UP (since DOWN's reverse is UP). Wait no—DOWN's opposite is UP? No—the movement rules say that "UP" and "DOWN" are not reverses of each other in the sense of left-right or right-left. Wait, no—the rule says:

Cannot reverse: If current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT".

Wait, I think it's that UP and DOWN are considered opposites? Or perhaps movement directions like LEFT/RIGHT and UP/DOWN are orthogonal, so reversing would be moving in the opposite direction along the same axis.

Wait no—the way it's written: "If current direction is 'UP', may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'". So if you're going UP, can't go DOWN next. Similarly, if going LEFT, can't go RIGHT next.

So in move 3, since last move was DOWN (from move 2), so current direction is DOWN. Therefore, next move can't be UP.

But wait, no—the movement rules say that the forbidden move is the reverse of the previous one. So if you were going LEFT, you can't go RIGHT next; if you're going UP, can't go DOWN next.

Wait no—it's not entirely clear whether UP and DOWN are considered reverses or just orthogonal directions. But from the wording: "If current direction is 'UP', may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'". So yes, if you were moving UP, can't move DOWN next, similar to LEFT/RIGHT.

So in this case, after move 2 (which was DOWN), the current direction is DOWN. Therefore, next move can't be UP.

But wait, no—the movement rules specify that you cannot reverse your previous direction, meaning if you went LEFT last, you can't go RIGHT now; same for UP and DOWN? Wait no—looking at the wording: "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'". So yes, moving in the opposite direction along the same axis (e.g., LEFT/RIGHT or UP/DOWN) is forbidden.

Wait, but wait—UP and DOWN are along the Y-axis, while LEFT and RIGHT are along X-axis. If you're moving UP, your reverse would be DOWN, so if you were going UP, you can't go DOWN next, and vice versa. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT: can't switch between them.

But that might not make much sense because up/down and left/right are orthogonal, but perhaps the rules treat any opposite direction as forbidden.

Alternatively, perhaps the rule is only that you cannot immediately reverse your previous movement along the same axis. So if you moved LEFT, you can't move RIGHT next, and if you moved UP, you can't move DOWN next.

But in this case, after moving DOWN (move 2), the current direction is DOWN, so move 3 can't be UP.

But perhaps it's better to think that any opposite direction on the same axis is forbidden. So:

If last movement was LEFT, can't go RIGHT next.

If last movement was RIGHT, can't go LEFT next.

Similarly, if last was UP, can't go DOWN; if last was DOWN, can't go UP.

So in move 3: current direction is DOWN (from move 2), so can't choose UP.

Possible moves for move 3: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But moving further down might not help because the apple is at (7,1). So perhaps we need to get back towards x=7.

Wait, after move 2, head is at (6,5), body at (6,6).

If I move LEFT again in move 3: new_head = (5,5)

Then insert old head (6,5) into body list: [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element (6,6). So new body is [ (6,5) ].

But this moves the snake further left, away from x=7 where the apple is. Not ideal.

Alternatively, move RIGHT in move 3: but wait, current direction was DOWN, so can I choose RIGHT? Let's see:

No—wait, no, if last movement was DOWN (move 2), then the forbidden next move is UP (since opposite on Y-axis). So moving LEFT or RIGHT is allowed because they're along X-axis, which is a different axis.

Wait no—the rule says you can't reverse your previous direction. If I moved DOWN, the reverse would be UP, so I can still choose LEFT or RIGHT.

So in move 3: possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but that's not helpful here).

Alternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT towards x=7.

Move 3: RIGHT to (7,5)

Insert old head (6,5) into body list: [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Since new_head != apple, remove last element (6,6). So new body is [ (6,5) ].

Wait no—the initial body after move 2 was [ (6,6) ]. Then in move 3, inserting old head (from move 2: (6,5)) into the body list makes it [ (6,5), (6,6) ], then remove last element (6,6). So new body is [ (6,5) ].

Wait no—that can't be right because after each move, you only add the old head and then remove the tail if not growing. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in tracking the body.

Let me try to outline this step by step for clarity:

Initial state:
HEAD: (7,6)
BODY: [ (7,5) ]

Move 1: LEFT
new_head = (6,6)
insert old head (7,6) into body list → BODY becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ]
since new_head != apple, remove last element → BODY is now [ (7,6) ]
so after move 1:
HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [ (7,6) ]

Move 2: DOWN
new_head = (6,5)
insert old head (6,6) into body list → BODY becomes [ (6,6), (7,6) ]
since new_head != apple, remove last element (7,6) → BODY is now [ (6,6) ]
so after move 2:
HEAD: (6,5)
BODY: [ (6,6) ]

Move 3: RIGHT
new_head = (7,5)
insert old head (6,5) into body list → BODY becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ]
since new_head != apple, remove last element (6,6) → BODY is now [ (6,5) ]
so after move 3:
HEAD: (7,5)
BODY: [ (6,5) ]

Now, the head is at (7,5), which is closer to the apple's y-coordinate of 1. The body is at (6,5).

Move 4: DOWN
new_head = (7,4)
insert old head (7,5) into body list → BODY becomes [ (7,5), (6,5) ]
since new_head != apple, remove last element (6,5) → BODY is now [ (7,5) ]
after move 4:
HEAD: (7,4)
BODY: [ (7,5) ]

Move 5: DOWN
new_head = (7,3)
insert old head (7,4) into body list → BODY becomes [ (7,4), (7,5) ]
remove last element (7,5) → BODY is now [ (7,4) ]
after move 5:
HEAD: (7,3)
BODY: [ (7,4) ]

Continue this way until head reaches y=1.

But wait, each time we move down, the body only keeps the previous head's position. So after several moves, the body would be a chain leading towards the apple.

Wait no—each time you move, you add the old head to the body list and then remove the last element (the tail) unless you're growing (which isn't the case here). So the body is only keeping track of the immediate previous positions, not the entire path. Wait, that can't be right because if you keep moving in a direction, your body would trail behind.

Wait no—each time you move, the body list represents all the segments of the snake except the head. So when you insert the old head into the body list, it's adding a new segment at the front (or maybe the end?), and then removing the last segment if not growing.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body is updated. Let me think about this:

When you move, the new head is added to the front of the body list, and if the snake isn't growing (i.e., hasn't eaten food), the last segment (tail) is removed.

So for example:

Initial state:
HEAD: (7,6)
BODY: [ (7,5) ]

Move 1: LEFT
new_head = (6,6)
insert into body list → BODY becomes [ (6,6), (7,5) ]
since no growth, remove last element → BODY is now [ (6,6) ]
Wait that can't be right because then the body would just have one segment. But actually, when you move, you add the new head to the front of the body list, and if not growing, remove the tail.

Wait perhaps it's better to model the body as a deque or list where each movement adds a new head and removes the tail unless food is eaten.

So more accurately:

Each time you move:

1. The new head position is calculated based on the direction chosen.
2. This new head is added to the front of the body list (which includes all segments except the current head).
3. If the snake has not eaten (i.e., no growth), remove the last segment (the tail) from the body list.

Wait, but in this problem, we're only considering movement; there's no mention of eating food or growing. So perhaps the snake is just moving, and the body follows by adding a new head and losing the tail each time, keeping the length constant.

But wait, initially, the snake has a head at (7,6) and one segment at (7,5). If it moves left to (6,6), then the new segments would be:

HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [ (7,6), (7,5) ]

Wait no—that doesn't make sense because moving left from (7,6) would have the body follow.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each move adds a new head position and removes the last segment unless food is eaten, which isn't relevant here since we're just trying to reach the apple without considering eating.

But perhaps in this problem, the snake can grow if it eats the apple, but for the purpose of reaching the apple, maybe we don't need to worry about that yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the body is represented as a list where each new head is added at the front, and the tail is removed unless food is eaten. So in this case:

Move 1: LEFT
new_head = (6,6)
body becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → but wait, no. Actually, the body segments are all the previous positions except the head.

Wait perhaps a better way to model it is:

The snake's body consists of all the positions from the tail up to the head, excluding the current head. So when you move, the new head is added, and the tail is removed if not growing.

So let's try this:

Initial state:
HEAD: (7,6)
BODY: [ (7,5) ]

Move 1: LEFT
new_head = (6,6)
body becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → but wait, no. Actually, when moving left, the previous head at (7,6) becomes part of the body, and the new head is at (6,6). The tail (7,5) would be removed unless food is eaten.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe each move adds a new segment at the front (the new head) and removes one from the end (the old tail), keeping the length the same if no growth occurs.

So initial body: [ (7,5) ]

Move 1: LEFT
new_head = (6,6)
body becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → wait, that would make the body have two segments, but initially, it was one. So perhaps:

Wait no—the snake's length is determined by the number of segments in the body plus the head. Initially, the body has 1 segment (the tail at (7,5)), so total length is 2 (head + tail).

When you move left, the new head is (6,6), and the old head (7,6) becomes part of the body. The tail (7,5) would be removed unless food is eaten.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the snake as a list where each step adds a new position at the front and removes one from the end if no growth occurs.

So:

Initial: [ (7,5), (7,6) ] → Wait no, that can't be right. The head is at (7,6), and the body has one segment at (7,5). So perhaps the list is ordered from tail to head as [ (7,5), (7,6) ], but when moving left, the new head is (6,6), so the new list becomes [ (7,6), (6,6) ] and the tail (7,5) is removed if no food is eaten.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to represent the snake as a deque where each move adds the new head to the front and pops the tail unless there's growth.

But perhaps for this problem, we don't need to model the body accurately; instead, focus on whether the path can reach the apple without colliding with itself.

Wait no—the problem is about the movement of the snake towards the apple, but I'm trying to figure out if it's possible and how many steps it would take. Maybe I'm overcomplicating by tracking each step.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of moves required for the snake to reach the apple can be calculated based on the distance in x and y directions.

The apple is at (7,1). The snake starts with its head at (7,6) and a body that extends down to (7,5), assuming it's a straight line downward. But actually, the initial position might have the head at (7,6) and the body following, but perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait no—the problem doesn't specify the snake's initial length or direction beyond the fact that its head is at (7,6). Maybe we can assume the snake is straight, with its body extending downward from (7,6) to (7,5), making it two segments long (head + one body segment).

But perhaps for simplicity, let's ignore the body and focus on the head movement. The minimal steps would be based on moving the head towards the apple.

The distance in x-direction: current head at 7, apple at 7 → no movement needed in x.

Distance in y-direction: from 6 to 1 is 5 units down.

So if the snake can move straight down without any obstacles (like its own body), it would take 5 moves to reach y=1, making the total steps 5.

But wait, each step moves one unit. So starting at y=6:

Step 1: y=5
Step 2: y=4
...
Step 5: y=1

So yes, it would take 5 steps if the snake can move straight down without colliding with its body.

However, since the snake's body is behind, we need to ensure that as the head moves down, the body doesn't block the path. If the snake is initially in a straight line downward (head at 7,6; body at 7,5), then moving down from there would have the head go to 7,5, but the body was already at 7,5, so that would cause collision.

Wait no—when the head moves down one step, it goes to (7,5), which is where its previous position was. But the body segments are behind, so perhaps the snake can't move into a position occupied by its own body unless it's growing or moving in a way that allows the body to shift.

Wait no—in most snake games, you can't move into your own body. So if the snake is straight down (head at 7,6; body at 7,5), and tries to move down again, the new head would be at (7,5), which is where the body segment is, causing a collision and ending the game.

Therefore, the initial assumption that the snake can just move straight down isn't possible because it would collide with its own body after one step.

So what can the snake do? It needs to maneuver in a way that allows it to reach (7,1) without colliding with its body.

One possible strategy is to make a U-turn. For example:

Initial position:
HEAD: (7,6)
BODY: [ (7,5) ]

Step 1: Move LEFT → HEAD: (6,6), BODY: [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → wait no, the body would only keep track of the previous positions. Wait, perhaps after moving left, the body becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ] but that might not be accurate.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each step carefully:

Each move adds a new head position and removes the tail unless food is eaten. But since we're not considering eating here, each move keeps the snake's length constant.

So initial state:
HEAD: (7,6)
BODY: [ (7,5) ]

Move 1: LEFT → HEAD: (6,6), BODY becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ] and remove the tail (7,5) because no food is eaten. Wait no—if you move left, the new head is at (6,6). The body would then be all the previous positions except the old head, so the body becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ], but since we're not growing, we remove the last element (the tail), which was (7,5), leaving the body as [ (7,6) ].

Wait that doesn't make sense because then the body would only have one segment after moving. Maybe I'm modeling this incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps each move adds a new head and keeps all previous segments except the last one if no growth occurs.

So:

Initial:
HEAD: (7,6)
BODY: [ (7,5) ]

Move 1: LEFT
new_head = (6,6)
body becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → but since we're not growing, we remove the last segment (7,5) → body is now [ (7,6) ]
Wait that would mean the snake's body is now at (7,6), which was the previous head position. But this seems odd because then the body is overlapping with where the head just was.

Alternatively, perhaps the body segments are all the positions except the current head, and each move adds the new head and removes the oldest segment if not growing.

Wait no—this is getting too complicated. Maybe for the purpose of solving this problem, we can assume that the snake can move freely as long as it doesn't cross its own path, but since the initial position only has two segments (head at 7,6; body at 7,5), moving left would allow the head to go to 6,6 without collision because the body is now at 7,6 and 7,5. Wait no—that can't be right.

Wait I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think that since the snake starts with its head at (7,6) and one body segment at (7,5), moving left would take the head to (6,6), and the body would follow as [ (7,6), (7,5) ], but then we remove the tail (7,5) because no food is eaten. So after move 1:

HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [ (7,6) ]

Wait that can't be right because the body should have two segments if the snake's length remains the same. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body updates.

Alternatively, perhaps each move adds a new head and keeps all previous positions except the last one, so the body grows by one unless food is eaten (which we're not considering). But that would mean the snake's length increases, which isn't the case here.

Wait no—without eating, the snake's length remains constant. So if it starts with a length of 2 (head + one segment), each move adds a new head and removes the last segment to keep the length the same.

So:

Initial:
HEAD: (7,6)
BODY: [ (7,5) ]

Move 1: LEFT
new_head = (6,6)
add to body → BODY becomes [ (7,6), (7,5) ]
remove tail → new BODY is [ (7,6) ] if we remove the oldest segment. Wait no—if we add the new head and keep all except the last, perhaps it's:

BODY after move 1: [ (7,6), (7,5) ] but since we're not growing, maybe only the new head is added and the tail is removed.

Wait I'm getting confused. Maybe a better way is to represent the body as a list where each step appends the new head and pops from the end if no food is eaten.

So:

Initial:
BODY = [ (7,5) ]
HEAD = (7,6)

After move LEFT:
new_head = (6,6)
BODY becomes [ (7,5), (7,6) ] → but we need to keep only the necessary segments. Wait no—if the snake's length is 2 (head + one body segment), then after moving left, the new head is at (6,6), and the previous head (7,6) becomes part of the body. The tail (7,5) would be removed if we're not growing.

Wait that makes sense. So:

Initial:
BODY = [ (7,5) ]
HEAD = (7,6)

After move LEFT:
new_head = (6,6)
BODY = [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → but since the snake's length is 2 (head + one body segment), we only keep the last two segments. Wait no—if the snake's initial length is 2, after moving left, it would have:

HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → but that makes three positions, which isn't possible without growing.

Wait I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can ignore the body and just calculate the minimal steps required if the snake could move freely, then adjust for any necessary detours due to the body blocking the path.

The minimal distance is 5 units down in y (from 6 to 1). If the snake could move straight down without collision, it would take 5 moves. But since moving directly down from (7,6) to (7,5) would cause a collision with its own body (since the body is at (7,5)), the snake needs to find an alternative path.

One way is to make a detour. For example:

1. Move left to (6,6)
2. Then move down repeatedly until reaching y=1.

But wait, after moving left, can the snake then move down without collision?

After step 1:
HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → Wait no, if the snake's initial body was only one segment at (7,5), moving left would add a new head at (6,6), and the body would now include (7,6) as the new tail? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving left once:

HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → but this would mean the snake's length is now 3, which isn't possible without eating. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial setup.

Wait maybe the snake starts with a longer body. The problem says "the head of the snake is at position (7,6)", but doesn't specify the rest of its body. Maybe for simplicity, we can assume that the snake's body doesn't block its path when moving left and then down.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps is 5, as it can move straight down, but considering the initial collision, maybe more steps are needed.

Wait no—if the snake moves down once from (7,6) to (7,5), it would collide with its body at (7,5). So that's impossible. Therefore, the snake must make a detour.

One possible path:

Move left → (6,6)
Then move down 5 times → y=1
Total steps: 1 + 5 = 6

But wait, after moving left once to (6,6), can the snake then move straight down without colliding with its body? Let's see:

After step 1:
HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [ (7,6), (7,5) ] → if the snake's length remains 2, then after moving left, the body would be at (7,6) and (7,5). Wait no—if the snake moves left, its new head is at (6,6), and the old head (7,6) becomes part of the body, but since we're not growing, the tail (probably at (7,5)) would need to be removed or adjusted.

Wait I'm getting stuck again. Maybe it's better to assume that after moving left once, the snake can then move down without collision because its body is no longer directly below it.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps is 6: one step left and five steps down.

But wait, moving from (7,6) left to (6,6), then down five times would reach y=1 at x=6, but the apple is at (7,1). So that's not directly below. Therefore, after reaching (6,1), the snake would need to move right back to x=7, which adds two more steps: from (6,1) to (7,1).

Wait no—after moving down to (6,1), it needs to go right once to reach (7,1). So total steps:

Left: 1
Down:5
Right:1
Total:7

But that's longer than necessary. Maybe there's a more efficient path.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can move in a U-shape:

Move left → (6,6)
Move down to (6,2) [4 steps]
Then right to (7,2)
Then up to (7,1). Wait no—that would take more steps and might not be necessary.

Wait another approach: The Manhattan distance from (7,6) to (7,1) is 5 in the y-direction. But due to the collision with its body when moving straight down, it needs to find an alternative path.

If the snake moves left once to (6,6), then can it move down and then right? Let's see:

Step 1: LEFT → (6,6)
Step 2: DOWN → (6,5)
Step 3: RIGHT → (7,5) – but wait, was there a body segment at (7,5)? Initially, the body was at (7,5), so moving right to (7,5) would cause collision with its own body.

Wait no—the initial body was at (7,5). After step 1, the head is at (6,6), and the body might be at (7,6) and (7,5). So when the snake moves down from (6,6) to (6,5), then right to (7,5), it would collide with its own body at (7,5).

Therefore, that path isn't possible. Maybe instead, after moving left to (6,6), move down several times and then right.

Wait let's try:

Step 1: LEFT → (6,6)
Step 2: DOWN → (6,5)
Step 3: DOWN → (6,4)
Step 4: RIGHT → (7,4)
Step 5: DOWN → (7,3)
Step 6: DOWN → (7,2)
Step 7: DOWN → (7,1)

That's a total of 7 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Alternatively:

After moving left once, move down four times to reach y=2, then right, then down one more step.

Wait that might not save any steps.

Another idea: Perhaps the snake can move in a square pattern to avoid its body.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe the minimal number of steps is 5 if it can go straight down, but due to collision, it needs to take a detour adding extra steps. However, without knowing the exact initial configuration of the snake's body beyond the head, it's hard to determine the exact number.

But wait—the problem doesn't specify any obstacles except the snake's own body. So perhaps the minimal path is 5 steps if moving straight down is possible, but since that causes collision, we need to find an alternative.

Wait no—if the snake moves straight down once from (7,6) to (7,5), it would collide with its body at (7,5). Therefore, it must avoid that. So the minimal path would involve moving left or right first to get out of the way, then proceed downward.

Assuming the snake can move left once, then down five times:

Total steps: 1 +5=6

But wait, after moving left to (6,6), the next step down would be to (6,5). The body is now at (7,6) and (7,5). So from (6,6), moving down to (6,5), then continuing down to y=1, which is 5 steps down. Wait no—from y=6 to y=1 is a difference of 5, but after moving left, the head is at y=6, so moving down once would take it to y=5.

Wait no—after step 1: (6,6)
Step 2: DOWN → (6,5)
Step 3: DOWN → (6,4)
...
Up to step 6: (6,1). Then move right twice to reach (7,1).

Total steps: 1 (left) +5 (down from y=6 to y=1 at x=6) +1 (right)=7.

But that's more than necessary. Alternatively, perhaps after moving left once and down once, the snake can then proceed diagonally? No, movement is grid-based, so only horizontal or vertical.

Wait no—each move changes either x or y by 1.

So to get from (6,6) to (7,1), the minimal steps would be:

Right once (x=7), then down five times (y=5,4,3,2,1). So total steps after moving left: right (step 2) + down five times (steps 3-7). Wait no—after step 1 is left to (6,6):

Step 1: LEFT → (6,6)
Step 2: RIGHT → (7,6)
But then you're back to x=7, y=6. Then moving down from there:

Step 3: DOWN → (7,5) – but initial body was at (7,5), so collision.

Therefore, that path isn't possible.

Alternatively, step 1: LEFT → (6,6)
Step 2: DOWN → (6,5)
Step 3: RIGHT → (7,5) – collision again at (7,5).

Hmm. Maybe the snake needs to move further left or right before moving down.

Perhaps:

Step 1: LEFT → (6,6)
Step 2: LEFT → (5,6)
Then step 3: DOWN → (5,5)
...
Continue down until y=1 at x=5, then right twice to reach x=7,y=1.

But that would take more steps:

Steps:

1. L
2. L
3. D
4. D
5. D
6. D
7. D
8. R
9. R

Total: 9 steps. That's worse.

Alternatively, move right instead of left:

Step 1: RIGHT → (8,6)
Then step 2: DOWN → (8,5)
...
Continue down to y=1 at x=8, then left once to reach x=7,y=1.

Total steps:1(R)+5(D)+1(L)=7 steps.

But that's still more than the straight down path which is blocked.

Wait but if moving right is possible without collision. The initial body was at (7,5). If the snake moves right from (7,6) to (8,6), then down to (8,5), etc., it avoids the initial body at (7,5).

So:

Step 1: RIGHT → (8,6)
Step 2: DOWN → (8,5)
Step 3: DOWN → (8,4)
...
Up to step 6: (8,1). Then LEFT once to reach (7,1).

Total steps:1(R)+5(D)+1(L)=7.

Alternatively, after reaching (8,1), move left once: total steps as above.

But is there a shorter path?

Wait from (8,6) down to (8,1) is 5 steps. Then left once. Total steps:1+5+1=7.

Alternatively, can the snake move diagonally? No, movement is grid-based.

So minimal steps considering detour would be 7.

But wait, maybe there's a more efficient way. What if the snake moves down one step first:

Step 1: DOWN → (7,5) – collision with body at (7,5). Not possible.

Therefore, must move left or right first.

So minimal steps after moving right once and then down would be 7.

But wait, perhaps moving two steps right to avoid any potential future collisions. But that would only add more steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to reach the apple in fewer than 7 steps? Maybe not if we have to detour.

Wait another idea: After moving left once to (6,6), can the snake then move down five times and then right once?

From (6,6) down to (6,1):5 steps. Then right to (7,1):1 step. Total steps after initial move:6 steps. Plus the first step: total 7.

Same as moving right first.

So minimal steps would be 7.

But wait, is that accurate? Let's recount:

Moving left once (step 1) → (6,6)
Then down five times (steps 2-6) → y=1 at x=6
Then right once (step7) → (7,1)

Yes, total of 7 steps.

Alternatively, moving right once (step1), then down five times (steps2-6), then left once (step7). Same total.

Therefore, the minimal number of steps required is 7.

But wait, initially, I thought it might be possible in fewer steps if the snake could maneuver differently. But considering the collision when moving straight down, it's necessary to take a detour, adding extra steps.

So the answer should be 7 steps.
</think>

The minimal number of steps required for the snake to reach the apple at position (7,1) is 7.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The snake starts at (7,6).
2. To avoid collision with its body at (7,5), it moves left once to (6,6).
3. Then it moves down five times: from y=6 to y=1 at x=6.
4. Finally, it moves right once to reach the apple at (7,1).

Total steps: 1 (left) + 5 (down) + 1 (right) = 7 steps.

Answer: \boxed{7}

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
