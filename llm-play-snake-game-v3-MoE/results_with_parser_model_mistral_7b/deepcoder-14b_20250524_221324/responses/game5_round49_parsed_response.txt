{"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"], "reasoning": "The snake needs to move downwards from its current position (9, 6) to reach the apple at (0, 9). To do this, it will first move 3 units down (since there are 3 units between (9, 6) and (6, 3)), then it will move left by one unit to (6, 2), then move up twice to (6, 4), and finally move right twice to (8, 4). From there, the snake will continue moving upwards and rightwards until it reaches the apple."}
