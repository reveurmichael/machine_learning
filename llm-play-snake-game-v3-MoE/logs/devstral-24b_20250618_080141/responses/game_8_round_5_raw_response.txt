========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the game state to determine a path for the snake head at `(4,7)` to reach the apple at `(3,5)`. Let's plan this step by step.

First, let's review the current state:
- Head position: `(4,7)`
- Current direction: `"LEFT"`
- Body cells: `[(5,7)]` (just one segment)
- Apple position: `(3,5)`

We need to determine a sequence of moves that will safely lead us from the head to the apple while following all game rules.

Let's analyze the position changes needed:
- To go from x=4 to x=3, we need 1 LEFT move.
- To go from y=7 to y=5, we need 2 DOWN moves.

We must also ensure that we don't reverse direction immediately (since current direction is "LEFT", we can't choose "RIGHT" on the first move).

Let's plan a path:

1. Move LEFT once to `(3,7)`
2. Move DOWN twice to reach `(3,5)`

This path is safe since it:
- Doesn't reverse direction immediately
- Avoids walls and body collisions (since we only have one body segment)
- Ensures the snake remains continuous

So our move sequence is: ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"]

Now let's format this as required:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move LEFT to reach x=3, then DOWN twice to reach y=5 while avoiding immediate direction reversal and body collisions."
}
```
