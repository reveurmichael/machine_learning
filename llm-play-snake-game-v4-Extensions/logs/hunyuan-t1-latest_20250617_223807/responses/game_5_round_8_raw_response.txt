========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 3 times (to reduce x from 9 to 6) and down once (to reduce y from 4 to 3). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing the current DOWN direction. Each LEFT move is safe as the new head positions (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) are not occupied by the body. The final DOWN move to (6,3) (apple) is safe, and after eating, there are legal moves (e.g., DOWN to (6,2)) to avoid trapping."
