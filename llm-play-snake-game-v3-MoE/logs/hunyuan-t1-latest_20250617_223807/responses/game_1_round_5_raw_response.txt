========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right once and up twice to reach the apple at (4,7). Starting with UP avoids reversing the current LEFT direction and moves toward the apple's y-coordinate. Next, RIGHT aligns the head horizontally with the apple. Finally, UP reaches the apple. This path avoids body collisions and ensures a safe move after eating the apple."
