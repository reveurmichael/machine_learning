I really love the idea of having EMPTY in the game_N.json file because it makes things to be so obvious. 




Because each marker exposes a different “blind spot” in the model’s behaviour, so when you skim the JSON you can tell—without replaying the game—why progress stalled.

1. INVALID_REVERSAL  
   • Logged when the LLM tries to send the snake straight back onto itself (e.g. last
     direction = RIGHT, proposal = LEFT).  
   • Every such entry pins down the exact round and the exact step where the rule was
     broken.  
   • By just counting these markers you instantly see how often the model still
     violates the no-reverse constraint, or whether it improves after fine-tuning.

2. EMPTY  
   • Logged when the LLM’s reply for a whole round contains an **empty `moves` list** –
     i.e. the model answered “[]”.  
   • Highlights rounds where the agent could not think of any legal move at all.  
   • Lets you separate “no idea” failures from parsing errors or time-outs, because
     the round is otherwise perfectly well-formed, just devoid of content.

Together they turn the `moves` timeline into a self-explanatory audit trail:

• normal direction strings → “model had a plan and we executed it”  
• INVALID_REVERSAL   → “model broke the game’s basic rule here”  
• EMPTY       → “model could not come up with a move at this round”

That one-line classification is enough to build quick stats, spot pathological
games, or jump straight to the rounds that need debugging—all without crawling
through raw prompts and responses.

To make the “EMPTY” concept first-class (and keep it perfectly in-sync with the two safety limits you expose on the CLI) you only have to touch three spots in the codebase.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  core/game_data.py  – centralise how an EMPTY tick is recorded
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Replace the current minimalist `record_empty_move()` with a version that
also drops the sentinel into every move list – exactly the way we already
treat `INVALID_REVERSAL`.

```203:220:core/game_data.py
    def record_empty_move(self):
        """Record an empty move (the snake stays in place)."""
        self.empty_steps += 1
        self.steps += 1
        self.consecutive_empty_moves += 1
        self.max_consecutive_empty_moves_reached = max(
            self.max_consecutive_empty_moves_reached,
            self.consecutive_empty_moves
        )

        # ------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Keep the invariant:  len(self.moves)  ==  self.steps
        # Add the sentinel so re-play & statistics know this was an ‘idle’ tick
        # ------------------------------------------------------------------
        self.moves.append("EMPTY")
        self.last_move = "EMPTY"

        # Track it inside the current round as well
        if "moves" not in self.current_round_data:
            self.current_round_data["moves"] = []
        self.current_round_data["moves"].append("EMPTY")
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2.  core/game_loop.py  – stop double-inserting the sentinel
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After the change above, the manual append is no longer needed (it would
create duplicates).  Delete the highlighted line.

```86:98:core/game_loop.py
        # Record for analysis
        game_manager.current_game_moves.append("EMPTY")
        # ... existing code ...
-       game_manager.game.game_state.moves.append("EMPTY")
        # Track consecutive empty moves
```

(Keeping the `current_game_moves.append("EMPTY")` line is fine – it is
just a debug list that never touches the JSON files.)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3.  core/game_manager.py  (+ one follow-up in GameController.reset)  
   propagate the user’s  --max-empty-moves-allowed  value
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Immediately after the game object is created, inject the CLI limit into
`GameData`, and store it so it survives future resets.

```109:118:core/game_manager.py
    def setup_game(self):
        """Set up the game logic and GUI."""
        # Initialize game logic
        self.game = GameLogic(use_gui=self.use_gui)

        # Propagate the CLI limit into the GameData object
        self.game.game_state.max_empty_moves_allowed = self.args.max_empty_moves_allowed
        # Remember it so every future reset restores the same limit
        self.game.game_state.max_empty_moves_allowed_override = self.args.max_empty_moves_allowed
```

Then make sure resets keep that override:

```117:131:core/game_controller.py
        # Reset game state tracker
        self.game_state.reset()

        # Re-apply custom move limits (if the GameManager set them)
        if hasattr(self.game_state, "max_empty_moves_allowed_override"):
            self.game_state.max_empty_moves_allowed = (
                self.game_state.max_empty_moves_allowed_override
            )

        self.game_state.record_apple_position(self.apple_position)
```

(If you prefer, you can do the same for
`--max-consecutive-something-is-wrong-allowed`; the mechanism is identical.)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What you gain
─────────────
• “EMPTY” now shows up in  
  – the global `detailed_history["moves"]` list, **and**  
  – each round’s `"moves"` array.  
  Both stay perfectly aligned with the `steps` counter.

• The per-game JSON now reports the **real** `max_empty_moves_allowed`
  value that the run used (no longer the hard-coded default).

• No more risk of duplicate “EMPTY” entries in the logs.

These three edits make the EMPTY sentinel a first-class citizen,
completely consistent with `--max-empty-moves-allowed` as well as with
the existing error-limit logic.



Behavior for “EMPTY” mirrors the one we just discussed for “SOMETHING_IS_WRONG.”

1. Where EMPTY appears  
   • In every executed-moves array (`detailed_history.moves`, `rounds_data.round_k.moves`) whenever the engine logs a no-move tick.  
   • Counted in each game’s `step_stats.empty_steps` and rolled up into `summary.json → step_stats.empty_steps`.

2. Where EMPTY does *not* appear  
   • `planned_moves` – those lists reflect the LLM’s intended directions; the LLM never “plans” an empty tick, so we keep the sentinel out to preserve that semantic meaning.

3. Invariants & validations  
   • All assertions (steps-vs-moves length, step-type totals, etc.) use executed-moves arrays, so every EMPTY tick is fully accounted for in counts.  
   • Because `planned_moves` is not part of any arithmetic check, its omission of EMPTY cannot cause a mismatch.

So:  
• EMPTY is present in executed moves and counted in stats.  
• EMPTY is absent from `planned_moves` by design, and that is perfectly safe for all current integrity checks.
