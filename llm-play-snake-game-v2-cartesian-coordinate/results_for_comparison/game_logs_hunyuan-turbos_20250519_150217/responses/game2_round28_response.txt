```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move left to decrease the x-coordinate from 7 to 0 and up to increase the y-coordinate from 8 to 9. The first move cannot reverse the current direction (RIGHT), so the first move is LEFT. Subsequent moves continue to prioritize moving left while ensuring no collisions with the body or walls."
