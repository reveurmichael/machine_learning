{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake must move left to decrease the x-coordinate from 9 to 2 and down to decrease the y-coordinate from 6 to 2. The first move cannot reverse the current direction (DOWN), so moving LEFT is safe. Subsequent moves continue to prioritize moving LEFT while also moving DOWN to approach the apple efficiently without colliding with the body or walls."
