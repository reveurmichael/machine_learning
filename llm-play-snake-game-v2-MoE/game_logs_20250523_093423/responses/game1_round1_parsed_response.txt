{"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake is at (5,5) and the apple is at (5,1). Moving directly down repeatedly ('DOWN') brings us closer to the apple without creating a trap since there are no obstacles or other snakes indicated in the information provided. Also, after eating the apple, our snake will have a body segment, but it will still have at least two legal moves available (LEFT and RIGHT) when we reach the final configuration."}
