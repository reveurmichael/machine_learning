BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the snake can get from (2,2) to eat the apple at (3,3). The current direction is LEFT, and the body cells are [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the snake's current position. The head is at (2,2), which is in the middle of the grid. The body cells show that the snake has been moving towards the left because the positions are decreasing in x from 4 down to 3 and then y changes as well. So the snake's tail is probably around (3,2) or earlier.

The apple is at (3,3), which is diagonally right and up from the head. The Manhattan distance here is (3-2)+(3-2)=2, so it should be two moves. But I need to plan the path carefully considering the movement rules and body constraints.

Since the current direction is LEFT, the first move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse direction. Wait no, the constraint says you cannot reverse direction, meaning if the snake is moving LEFT, it can't next move RIGHT. So from LEFT, possible moves are UP or DOWN? Or wait, the initial direction is LEFT, so in the first move, I can't go RIGHT.

Wait, looking back: The movement rules say that the snake cannot reverse direction. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. But in this case, the current direction is LEFT, but the last move was not necessarily a LEFT because the body cells suggest it's moving towards left. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no: The initial direction is given as LEFT, so that means the snake's head is currently moving in the LEFT direction. So the next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse the direction from LEFT to RIGHT, which is not allowed unless the current direction is NONE. Since it's LEFT, the first move cannot be RIGHT.

So possible moves are UP or DOWN or LEFT again? Wait no, movement directions can't reverse, but can you keep moving in the same direction? I think yes. So from LEFT, next move can be LEFT again (if safe) or perhaps UP or DOWN if that's needed.

Looking at the head position (2,2), and possible moves:

- Moving LEFT would take it to (1,2). But is there a body part in that path? The body cells are [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]. So from the head at (2,2), moving left to (1,2) doesn't collide with any body cell because the next body is at (3,2). So that's safe.

Wait no, wait: The body cells are the snake's body excluding the head. So after moving, the new head would be (new position), and then each segment follows. So if I move LEFT first, to (1,2), then the body would shift, but let's think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps the best path is to go UP first to avoid collision with the body.

Wait, looking at the current body: The head is at (2,2). The next body cell is (3,2) and (4,2), etc. So if I move LEFT from (2,2), I go to (1,2), which is clear because the body starts at (3,2).

But wait, after moving, the new head is (1,2), then the old head (2,2) becomes part of the body, so we have to check if any future moves would collide with this.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to move UP first. Let me visualize:

From (2,2):

- Moving UP takes it to (2,3). From there, next move can be RIGHT to reach (3,3), which is the apple.

So two moves: UP then RIGHT. But wait, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so we need to ensure that this doesn't cause a collision in future steps.

Wait, but let's check:

First move: UP from (2,2) to (2,3). Now, the body cells are [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]. The new head is at (2,3), which isn't part of the body yet. Then the next move is RIGHT to (3,3), where the apple is.

But wait, after moving UP to (2,3), the body will shift: the old head (2,2) becomes the next body cell, so the new body cells would be [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)], but wait no—the body is a list of segments excluding the head. So when you move, the head moves first, then each body segment follows.

So after moving UP, the new head is at (2,3). The previous body cells are [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]. Now, the new position of these body segments would be:

The head was at (2,2) and moved to (2,3). So the first body cell (4,5) is now moving towards (3,5)? Wait no, each segment follows the previous one. It's more like a queue.

So when you move the head, all the body segments follow in order. So after moving UP, the new body would be:

Head: (2,3)

Body cells: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)] → but wait, each of these will shift towards the head.

Wait no, it's more like when you move the head, each body segment takes the position of the previous one. So for example:

Original head: (2,2)

Body cells: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]

When moving to (2,3) via UP, the new head is at (2,3). The body segments then shift as follows:

The old head (now part of body) would be at (2,2). Then the next segment was (3,2), so it moves to (2,2). Wait no—this might not be correct. Each segment takes the position of the previous one.

Actually, each segment is linked in a line. So when the head moves, each body part follows the movement of the part before it.

So, let me think step by step:

Original positions:

Head: (2,2)

Body cells: [B5=(4,5), B4=(4,4), B3=(4,3), B2=(4,2), B1=(3,2)]

After moving UP to (2,3):

New head: (2,3)

The previous body cell B1 was at (3,2). Now, after the move, each body segment moves:

B5 becomes where B4 was → (4,4)

B4 becomes where B3 was → (4,3)

B3 becomes where B2 was → (4,2)

B2 becomes where B1 was → (3,2)

And B1 is now at the old head position: (2,2).

So the new body cells after the move would be [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)].

Now, when moving from (2,3) to eat the apple at (3,3):

After eating the apple, the snake's tail doesn't shrink because it ate an apple. So the body would be:

Head: (3,3)

Body cells: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]

Wait no—actually, when you move to eat the apple, the tail doesn't shrink. So after eating, the snake's body grows by one segment because it ate the apple.

So in this case, moving from (2,3) to (3,3):

New head: (3,3)

Body cells: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)].

Wait no, because the body was originally [B5=(4,5), B4=(4,4), B3=(4,3), B2=(4,2), B1=(3,2)]. After moving to (2,3), the new body cells are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)], right?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think differently.

After moving UP, the head is at (2,3). The next move is to go RIGHT to (3,3) where the apple is. So the move sequence would be ["UP", "RIGHT"].

But after eating the apple, the snake's body grows by one segment because it ate the apple, so the tail doesn't shrink. Therefore, the body cells will now include all previous ones plus a new segment at (2,3), but actually, when you eat an apple, you add a new segment to the end of the current body.

Wait no: When you eat an apple, the snake's body grows by one segment. So in this case, moving from (2,2) → UP → (2,3) and then RIGHT → (3,3). After eating the apple at (3,3), the body would consist of all previous segments plus a new one added at the end.

So after moving to (3,3), since we ate an apple, the tail doesn't move. So the snake's length increases by 1. Therefore, the body cells would be [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)], and the new head is at (3,3).

Wait no—this might not be accurate because when you eat an apple, you add a segment to the body. So each move after eating the apple will keep that extra segment.

But regardless of that, let's check if moving UP then RIGHT is possible without collision.

When moving from (2,2) → UP to (2,3), are there any body parts in that path? The body cells are [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]. So none of these are at (2,3). After moving, the new body is [B5=(4,4), B4=(4,3), B3=(4,2), B2=(3,2), B1=(2,2)].

Then moving RIGHT from (2,3) to (3,3): The new head is at (3,3). Are there any body parts in the path? After the first move, the body cells are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. So moving right from (2,3) to (3,3)—the cell (3,3) is where the apple is. Since it's not part of the body yet, it's safe.

But wait, after moving UP and eating the apple, the snake grows, so the next move would have a longer body. But in this case, since we are moving directly to the apple in two steps, perhaps that's acceptable.

Wait no—actually, when you eat an apple, you add a new segment at the end of the body, which is where the tail was before. So after eating, the snake's body includes all previous segments plus a new one.

But regardless, moving UP then RIGHT seems safe because neither move causes collision with the body or walls.

Wait, but let me double-check: After moving UP to (2,3), the body cells are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. Then moving RIGHT to (3,3) would make the head at (3,3). The apple is there, so we eat it. Now, since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't shrink, so the body becomes [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (new segment)]. Wait no—actually, when you eat an apple, the new head is added, and the previous body segments are retained. So the snake's length increases by one.

But in this case, moving from (2,3) to (3,3) would require checking if any of the body parts after that move would collide with each other. Since we're at (3,3), which is the apple, and then next step, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Another thing to consider: The final position check requires that the number of RIGHT moves minus LEFT equals 1, and UP minus DOWN equals 1. So in this case, "UP" and "RIGHT"—both counts are +1 each, so that satisfies the condition.

But wait, let's count: From (2,2), moving UP then RIGHT would result in:

RIGHT moves: 1

LEFT moves: 0 → 1-0=1 (correct)

UP moves: 1

DOWN moves: 0 → 1-0=1 (correct)

So that meets the condition.

But let me check if there's any other path. For example, moving RIGHT first would be impossible because current direction is LEFT, and you can't reverse to RIGHT. So first move must be either UP or DOWN or LEFT again.

Wait, no—current direction is LEFT, but movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction. So from LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. But you can move in any other direction except reversing.

So possible moves are: LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

If I try moving LEFT first:

From (2,2) → LEFT to (1,2). Then, is there a safe path from there to (3,3)?

After moving LEFT, the body becomes [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)], and the new head is at (1,2).

Then, next move could be RIGHT twice: but can you reverse direction?

Wait no—if after moving LEFT, the current direction is still LEFT? Or does each move set the direction to where it moved.

I think after each move, the direction becomes the new heading. So if you start facing LEFT and move LEFT again, that's allowed unless blocked by body segments or walls.

But in this case, from (1,2), can we then move DOWN, RIGHT, etc.? Wait, but let me check the possible path.

From (1,2) → perhaps move DOWN to (1,3), then right to (2,3), then right again to (3,3).

So the moves would be: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT.

But that's four moves instead of two. So less efficient.

Alternatively, from (1,2):

- Move RIGHT to (2,2), but that cell is now part of the body since after moving LEFT, the body cells are [B5=(4,5), B4=(4,4), B3=(4,3), B2=(4,2), B1=(3,2), (old head)=(2,2)].

Wait no, after moving LEFT to (1,2), the new body is:

Head: (1,2)

Body cells: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]

So from (1,2) → RIGHT would be to (2,2). But (2,2) is now part of the body. So moving right is blocked by the body.

Therefore, that path isn't possible.

Alternatively, moving DOWN from (1,2) to (1,3), which is not blocked. Then move RIGHT twice: but wait, after moving to (1,3), the next move could be RIGHT to (2,3), then another move to (3,3). But that's three moves, and we have to see if any of those positions are blocked.

After first move: LEFT → (1,2)

Body cells: [4,5; 4,4; 4,3; 4,2; 3,2; 2,2]

Second move: DOWN from (1,2) → (1,3). Is that position blocked? No, because body cells are all in the 4 and 3 columns for rows 5 to 2. So (1,3) is safe.

Third move: RIGHT → (2,3). Safe?

After moving to (1,3), body cells become:

[4,5; 4,4; 4,3; 4,2; 3,2; 2,2; 1,2]

Wait no—each time you move, the body segments follow. So when you move from (1,2) to (1,3), the new head is at (1,3). The previous body cells [B5=(4,5), B4=(4,4), B3=(4,3), B2=(4,2), B1=(3,2), H=(1,2)].

After moving to (1,3):

New body cells: [B5=(4,5), B4=(4,4), B3=(4,3), B2=(4,2), B1=(3,2), H_prev=(1,2)]

So the new head is at (1,3). The previous body cells are now [4,5; 4,4; 4,3; 4,2; 3,2; 1,2]. So moving to (1,3) is safe.

Then from (1,3), move RIGHT to (2,3). Is that position blocked? The body cells after the first two moves are [4,5; 4,4; 4,3; 4,2; 3,2; 1,2]. So moving right to (2,3) is safe.

Then from (2,3), move RIGHT again to (3,3). Is that blocked? The body cells are [4,5; 4,4; 4,3; 4,2; 3,2; 1,2], so moving right is safe. But wait, after moving to (3,3), we eat the apple, and since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move.

But in this case, moving from (2,3) → (3,3) would be blocked if (3,3) is part of the body? No—because the body cells are still [4,5; 4,4; 4,3; 4,2; 3,2; 1,2]. So (3,3) isn't occupied.

Wait no, but actually, when you move to (3,3), that's where the apple is. Since it's not part of the body yet, it's safe to eat. After eating, since an apple was eaten, the snake grows by adding a new segment at the tail.

So in this scenario, moving LEFT → DOWN → RIGHT → RIGHT would result in four moves, but perhaps that's longer than necessary.

Alternatively, is there a way to reach (3,3) faster?

But given that after the first move of LEFT, it becomes difficult to get back towards the apple because the body blocks some paths.

So the initial approach of moving UP then RIGHT seems better and shorter.

Another consideration: After moving UP and eating the apple, is the next move possible without collision? Let's see:

After UP → (2,3), body cells are [4,5; 4,4; 4,3; 4,2; 3,2; 2,2].

Then moving RIGHT to (3,3): that cell isn't part of the body, so it's safe. After eating, since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new body is [4,5; 4,4; 4,3; 4,2; 3,2; 2,2] plus a new segment at (the old head position) (2,3). So the body becomes [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)].

Wait no—actually, when you eat an apple, the new segment is added at the end of the current body. The current head after moving to (3,3) would be (3,3). Then, since an apple was eaten, the tail doesn't move. So the body cells would be [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)], and then adding a new segment at (the old head position before eating). Wait no—this is getting confusing.

Perhaps it's better to accept that moving UP then RIGHT works without collision.

But let me think again about the possible moves:

Move 1: UP from (2,2) → (2,3): safe because no body parts in (2,3).

Body after move 1: [B5=(4,5), B4=(4,4), B3=(4,3), B2=(4,2), B1=(3,2); head at (2,3)].

Move 2: RIGHT from (2,3) → (3,3): safe because (3,3) is the apple and not part of the body yet.

After move 2: eat the apple. So the snake's body grows by one segment. Therefore, the new body includes all previous segments plus a new one at the tail, but since an apple was eaten, it doesn't shrink. Wait no—actually, when you eat an apple, the tail remains as is; the head moves forward, and a new segment is added at the old tail position.

Wait that's incorrect. The snake grows by adding a new segment to its body when it eats an apple. So after moving from (2,3) to (3,3), which is eating the apple, the new body would be:

Head: (3,3)

Body cells: [B5=(4,5), B4=(4,4), B3=(4,3), B2=(4,2), B1=(3,2), old head at (2,2)].

Wait no—when moving, each body segment follows the previous one. So when you move from (2,3) to (3,3), the new position of the body segments would be:

Old head: (2,3)

After moving right to (3,3):

- New head: (3,3)
- Previous body cells shift: B5 moves to where B4 was, etc.

Wait no—this is getting too complicated. Let me instead think about whether after two moves UP then RIGHT, we can reach the apple without collision and satisfy the final position condition.

Yes, that's correct. Because both moves are valid (no collision with body or walls), and they meet the required counts for direction changes.

Therefore, the optimal path is ["UP", "RIGHT"].
</think>

The shortest path to eat the apple while satisfying all constraints is achieved by moving UP then RIGHT.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake's head is at (2,2), and the body extends towards higher x-values in column 4. The apple is located at (3,3).

2. **First Move – UP:**
   - Direction: From LEFT, moving UP is allowed as it doesn't reverse direction.
   - New Head Position: (2,3).
   - Check for Collision: No body segments are at (2,3), so the move is safe.

3. **Second Move – RIGHT:**
   - Direction: Current heading after UP is now towards column 4? Wait, no—moving UP changes the y-coordinate but not x. So the direction remains as per movement.
   - From (2,3), moving RIGHT increases x to 3.
   - New Head Position: (3,3), which is where the apple is located.
   - Check for Collision: The apple's position isn't blocked by any body segments, so it's safe.

4. **Eat the Apple:**
   - After reaching (3,3), the snake eats the apple. Since an apple was consumed, the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the old tail's position if needed, but in this case, since we only moved twice, the body remains as [B5=(4,5), B4=(4,4), B3=(4,3), B2=(4,2), B1=(3,2), (old head)=(2,2)] plus the new head at (3,3).

5. **Final Position and Directions:**
   - The snake successfully eats the apple with two moves.
   - The direction changes from LEFT to UP then to RIGHT, satisfying the movement constraints.

**Answer:** \boxed{["UP", "RIGHT"]}
