========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll need to use Python's json module to generate the required response.

Let me analyze the current state and plan the path:

Current head position: (6, 6)
Apple position: (8, 8)

Since we're moving from (6, 6) to (8, 8), I need:
- 2 RIGHT moves
- 2 UP moves

Also, I need to avoid collisions with the snake's body [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)] and ensure we don't run into walls.

Let me first check if there are any potential obstacles on this path:

1. Moving RIGHT:
- (7, 6) is not in the body
- (8, 6) is not in the body

2. Moving UP:
- (6, 7) is not in the body
- (6, 8) is not in the body

Let me use Python to plan this path:

```python
import json

# Current state
head = (6, 6)
apple = (8, 8)
body = [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)]
direction = "UP"

# Plan moves
moves = []
current_position = head

while current_position != apple:
    x, y = current_position

    # Check if we can move RIGHT to reach apple
    if x < apple[0] and (x+1, y) not in body and (x+1, y) != (9, 9):
        moves.append("RIGHT")
        current_position = (x+1, y)
    # Check if we can move UP to reach apple
    elif y < apple[1] and (x, y+1) not in body and (x, y+1) != (9, 9):
        moves.append("UP")
        current_position = (x, y+1)
    else:
        # No valid path found
        break

# Check if we've reached the apple
if current_position == apple:
    result = {
        "moves": moves,
        "reasoning": f"Direct path from {head} to {apple} avoiding body segments"
    }
else:
    result = {
        "moves": [],
        "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND"
    }

print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```
