========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

 {
    "moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT"],
    "reasoning": "Since the head is currently at (5,9) and the apple is at (3,8), we can move 2 units to the left and 1 unit down without colliding. This initial move sequence ensures the snake doesn't reverse direction and maintains continuity in the body positions."
