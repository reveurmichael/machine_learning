{
    "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT", "UP"],
    "reasoning": "We start moving right to reach the apple horizontally due to its x-coordinate (5) being greater than our current x-coordinate (1). Then we move up to reach the apple vertically. After eating the apple, we adjust our path to avoid immediate self-collision by moving left before moving up again."
