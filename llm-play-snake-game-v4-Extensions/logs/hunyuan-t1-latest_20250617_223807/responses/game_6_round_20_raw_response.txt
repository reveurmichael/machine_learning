========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (2,5) with direction DOWN. To reach the apple at (3,2), the path requires moving right once and down three times. The initial DOWN move to (2,4) is safe (no body collision). Next, RIGHT to (3,4) avoids body segments. Then, DOWN to (3,3) and finally DOWN to (3,2) (apple) are all safe. After eating, there are legal moves (e.g., DOWN to (3,1)), ensuring no immediate trap."
