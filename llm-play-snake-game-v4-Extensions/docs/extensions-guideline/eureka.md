# Eureka: Reward Function Evolution for Snake Game AI

This document outlines the implementation of Eureka-style automated reward function generation and evolution for reinforcement learning agents in the Snake Game AI project.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

Eureka represents a paradigm shift in reinforcement learning where reward functions are automatically generated and evolved using large language models (LLMs) rather than being hand-crafted by humans. This approach can discover novel and effective reward shaping strategies that might not be intuitive to human designers.

### **Core Concept**
- **Traditional RL**: Human-designed reward functions
- **Eureka Approach**: LLM-generated and evolved reward functions
- **Benefits**: Discovers non-obvious reward patterns, reduces human bias, enables rapid experimentation

### **Extension Structure** # TODO: this is not the final structure. Maybe it's good, maybe not. Up to you to adopt it or not.
