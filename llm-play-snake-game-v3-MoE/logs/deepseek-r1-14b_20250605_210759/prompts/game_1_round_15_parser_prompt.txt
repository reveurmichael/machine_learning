<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (0,5) to the apple at (6,0). Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the current state of the snake: The head is at (0,5), and the body cells are [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4)]. So the snake is moving in a way that it's going down and then right. The current direction is "LEFT," which means the head is moving to the left from its previous position.

The apple is at (6,0). To get there, the snake needs to move east (right) 6 units in the x-direction and south (down) 5 units in the y-direction. But since the grid only goes up to (9,9), I need to make sure that all moves stay within these bounds.

Now, let's think about movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction immediately. Since it's currently moving LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So possible initial directions are UP or DOWN, but wait, actually, no—the current direction is LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT because that would be a reversal. Wait, no—reversing is when you go opposite direction. So if it's moving LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT? Or is LEFT and RIGHT considered opposites?

Wait, according to the movement rules: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So yes, if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. So from LEFT, possible moves are UP or DOWN.

But wait, the initial direction is LEFT. The head is at (0,5). If I go LEFT again, that would take it to (-1,5), which is outside the grid—so that's invalid because the snake dies if it goes out of bounds. So the first move can't be LEFT.

So from LEFT, possible next moves are UP or DOWN. Let me see:

If I choose UP: new head is (0,6). Is this position safe? The body cells after moving would shift. But wait, the body list doesn't include the head yet—so when we compute collision, we need to check if the new_head collides with any BODYi except potentially the tail.

Wait, the collision rule says: If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So in this case, after moving, the body segments shift.

So for each possible direction, I need to compute the new head and check if it's valid.

Let me first try to visualize the initial setup:

Snake is at (0,5) as head. The body starts with (1,5), then (2,5). Then down to (2,4), (2,3), etc., all the way to (8,4). So the snake's body is arranged in a kind of 'L' shape, going right from (0,5) to (8,5) but then moving down.

Wait no: The body list is [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ...]. So starting behind the head at (0,5), the next segment is (1,5)—so the snake was moving right before. But current direction is LEFT, which means it's now going left from (0,5) back towards (-1,5), but that's invalid.

Wait no—current direction is LEFT, so last move was LEFT, bringing the head to (0,5). The previous position of the head would have been (1,5), which is the first body cell. So after moving LEFT, the head is at (0,5), and the next segment is at (1,5).

So if I choose UP as the next move, new_head is (0,6). Now, check for collisions: The current body cells are [(1,5), (2,5), ...]. So (0,6) isn't in the body except perhaps the tail. Wait, what's the tail? The last element of the body list is (8,4)—so that's the tail. When moving, if we don't eat an apple, the tail will move as well.

Wait no—the movement update rule says: If new_head == apple position, grow; else, remove the tail. So in this case, since we're not eating the apple initially, after moving to (0,6), the body would shift, and the last segment (8,4) would be removed.

But for collision check, we have to see if the new head is colliding with any of the current body except possibly the tail's position. Because when the snake moves, the tail will move as well—so if the new head is at a position that the tail was going to move into, it might not be a collision.

Wait, but according to rule 3 for collision: If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So in other words, only if the new head is on a body segment that isn't the tail—because the tail will move away.

So in this case, new head (0,6) doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly none because the body starts at (1,5). So it's safe to move UP.

But wait, let me make sure. The body list is from (1,5) down to (8,4). None of these are (0,6), so moving up is safe.

So first move could be "UP".

Let's try that.

Move 1: UP to (0,6).

Now, the new head is at (0,6). The body list after this move would have the old head (0,5) inserted at the front. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (8,4) would be removed.

So new body becomes [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (7,3), (8,3)]. Wait no—the initial body is [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), etc., up to (8,4). After inserting the old head (0,5) at front, it becomes [ (0,5), (1,5), ... , (8,4) ]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the last element (8,4), so body is now [(0,5), (1,5), ..., (7,3)].

Wait no—the initial body list is given as [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4)]. So inserting the old head (0,5) at front makes it [(0,5), (1,5), ..., (8,4)], and then removing the last element gives [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), ..., (7,3)].

Wait no, because the original body list is length 11 (from index 0 to 10). After inserting old head at front, it's length 12. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element—so new body list has 11 elements: from (0,5) down to (7,3).

But wait, the initial body is after the head. So when you insert the old head, the new body starts with old head and then the rest.

So for move UP:

new_head = (0,6)
BODY becomes [old_head] + current_body → [(0,5), (1,5), ..., (8,4)]
then remove tail if not eating apple. Since apple is at (6,0) ≠ new_head (0,6), so we do remove the tail.

So new body is [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ..., (7,3)].

Wait, but original current_body was 11 elements. So after insertion, it's 12, then remove last → back to 11? Or does the body length change only when eating apple?

No: rule 3c says if not eating apple, remove tail, so body remains same length as before.

Wait, initial body is 11 segments (from head onwards?), no. Wait in the movement update:

After moving, you insert old_head at front of BODY list. So S becomes [new_head] + [old_head, ...].

Then, if not eating apple, remove tail → so body remains same length as before.

Wait, but initial after inserting, the new_body is [old_head] + current_body. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element (the original last of current_body) because that's the tail that would have moved.

But this might complicate things—maybe it's better to think in terms of body list after movement.

In any case, moving UP seems safe for the first step.

Now, after move 1: head is at (0,6), direction is now UP. Next possible moves can't be DOWN because that would reverse from UP.

So next directions could be LEFT or RIGHT? Wait no—current direction is UP, so can't go DOWN as next move.

Wait, current direction was LEFT for the first step, then after moving UP, the new direction becomes UP. So next possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN—but not opposite of UP, which is DOWN?

No, because after moving UP, the current direction is now UP, so next move can't be DOWN.

So from UP, next directions are LEFT or RIGHT.

Wait no: according to movement rules, you can't reverse. So if you're currently going UP, you can't go DOWN next; but other directions are allowed.

So possible moves after UP would be LEFT, RIGHT, or same as current direction (UP).

But I think in most snake games, you can change direction except for 180 degrees.

In this case, the rule is that you can't move in the exact opposite direction. So from UP, you can't go DOWN; but LEFT and RIGHT are allowed.

So after first move: head at (0,6), direction UP. Next possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT.

Let me consider moving to the right next—direction RIGHT would take us towards increasing x.

But wait, from (0,6), if we go RIGHT to (1,6). Is that position safe?

Looking at the current body after first move:

body is [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (7,3)]. So (1,6) isn't in the body except possibly nowhere—because body has (1,5) but not (1,6). So moving RIGHT to (1,6) would be safe.

So move 2: RIGHT to (1,6).

Now, new head is at (1,6), direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT because that's reverse of RIGHT.

Wait no—current direction is RIGHT; the next move can't be LEFT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

But let me check if moving further right would get us closer to apple at (6,0).

Alternatively, maybe we should go down after moving up once.

Let's see:

After first move: head at (0,6). Then next move is RIGHT to (1,6), as above.

Then from (1,6), possible moves are DOWN or further RIGHT.

But the apple is at (6,0), which is lower right from current position. So perhaps moving down would help.

Wait, but let's think about how the body will shift and whether we can get to (6,0) without hitting ourselves.

Alternatively, maybe after first move up to (0,6), then moving right a few times and then down.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move UP from (0,5) → (0,6). Body now starts with (0,5), then the rest shifts.

2. Then move RIGHT to (1,6).

3. Then continue moving right to (2,6), (3,6)... until x=6.

But wait, when we get to (6,6), we need to start moving down towards y=0.

Wait, but let's see if that path is clear.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving up once and then moving down several times would be better.

Hmm. Maybe a better approach is to go straight right from the starting point, but since current direction is LEFT, I can't move RIGHT immediately.

Wait no—current direction is LEFT, so next move can be UP or DOWN.

So first move could be UP or DOWN.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first would allow us to change directions more effectively.

Let me think: if I move DOWN from (0,5) to (0,4). Is that safe?

The body after the head is at (1,5), so new_head (0,4) isn't in the body except possibly nowhere. So moving down would be safe.

So move 1: DOWN to (0,4).

Then direction is now DOWN.

Next possible moves can't be UP; but LEFT or RIGHT are allowed.

Wait no—current direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP. So possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

But from (0,4), moving LEFT would take us to (-1,4)—invalid.

So only possible move is RIGHT.

Move 2: RIGHT from (0,4) → (1,4).

Now head at (1,4), direction is RIGHT.

Next move can't be LEFT. So directions are UP or DOWN or continue RIGHT.

But let's see if we can make progress towards the apple.

The apple is at (6,0). From (1,4), moving right to 6 would require 5 more steps right. Then down from y=4 to y=0—another 4 steps down.

So perhaps after reaching x=6 at y=4, move down.

But let's see the path:

After move 2: head is at (1,4), body starts with (0,4), then (1,5)—wait no, initial body was [(1,5), ...]. Let me re-examine.

Wait initial state: head at (0,5), direction LEFT. Body is [(1,5), (2,5), etc.] So when we move DOWN to (0,4), the new head is (0,4). The body becomes [old_head (0,5)] + current_body → so the new body starts with (0,5), followed by (1,5), (2,5), etc. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, remove tail—so new body is [(0,5), (1,5), ..., (7,3)].

Then moving RIGHT to (1,4) would be the next move, which seems safe because (1,4) isn't in the current body except for possibly nowhere.

But wait, after inserting old_head at front, the body is [(0,5), (1,5), ...], then we remove last element—so the new body after moving DOWN is [(0,5), (1,5), ..., (7,3)]? Or does it change differently?

I think I'm getting stuck in the details. Maybe it's better to outline a path.

Option 1:

Move 1: UP → (0,6)

Then move RIGHT until x=6, then DOWN to (6,0).

But let's see if that works.

After move 1: head at (0,6), body is [ (0,5), (1,5), ..., (7,3) ]

Move 2: RIGHT → (1,6). Body becomes [ (0,6), (0,5), ... , (7,3) ] with the tail removed.

But wait, no—movement steps are:

After inserting old_head at front, then removing tail if not eating apple.

So in this case, after move 1: new_head is (0,6). Insert old_head (0,5) → body becomes [ (0,5), (1,5), ..., (8,4) ]. Then remove last element (8,4) because we didn't eat apple. So new body is [ (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (7,3) ].

Then move 2: RIGHT → (1,6). Now insert old_head (0,6) at front of current_body → [ (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), ..., (7,3) ]. Then remove last element (7,3). So new body is [ (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (6,3) ].

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to just simulate each move step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find the shortest path from (0,5) to (6,0), considering that the snake can't reverse direction immediately and must avoid self-collision except for the tail which moves.

But given the complexity, maybe moving right as much as possible after reaching a certain point would be best.

Alternatively, perhaps another initial move could be better. Let's see:

If I first move UP to (0,6), then RIGHT to 6,6—then DOWN to 6,0.

But I have to make sure that when moving down from (6,6) to (6,5), etc., the body doesn't block the path.

Wait, but after several moves right and then down, the body might get in the way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go DOWN first.

Another approach: Let me try to map out possible directions.

Current head: (0,5)

Body: [(1,5), (2,5), ..., (8,4)]

Apple at (6,0).

I need to move east 6 units and south 5 units. But the snake can't go west because that would take it outside the grid.

So initial options:

Move 1: UP → (0,6)

Or Move 1: DOWN → (0,4)

But moving UP seems better as it doesn't restrict future moves as much.

Let me try move 1: UP to (0,6).

Now direction is UP. Next possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT.

From (0,6), can't move LEFT because x=0. So only RIGHT.

Move 2: RIGHT → (1,6)

Body after this move would be [ (0,5), (0,6) ] + current_body except last element? Not sure. But in any case, moving right is safe.

Then Move 3: RIGHT → (2,6)

And so on until x=6.

Move 7: RIGHT → (6,6)

Now head at (6,6), direction RIGHT.

Next move can't be LEFT because that's the opposite of RIGHT.

So next directions are UP or DOWN or continue RIGHT. But since we're already at max x=6, perhaps now start moving down.

But wait, apple is at y=0, which is 6 units below.

So from (6,6), move DOWN to (6,5).

Is that safe? Let's check body.

After reaching (6,6), the body would have been shifting each time. So (6,6) is new head; previous parts of the body are behind.

Assuming no self-intersection yet, moving down should be okay.

Then continue moving DOWN until y=0.

But to do that, I need to make sure that when moving down from 6→5→4..., the snake doesn't block itself.

Wait, but as we move down, each segment follows, so it's possible, as long as there are no loops in the body.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to have the snake spiral or something, but I think it's manageable by moving right then down.

But given that the initial moves would be UP and RIGHT, let me outline:

Moves 1-6: Move UP once, then RIGHT five times to reach (6,5+something). Wait no—starting at (0,5), move UP to 0,6; then RIGHT six times to 6,6.

Then from 6,6, need to move DOWN five times to reach 6,1. Then LEFT once to 5,1, etc.—no, that's not helpful.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, after reaching (6,6), move DOWN until y=0, which would be six moves down: from 6→5→4→3→2→1→0.

But the snake is currently at x=6, y=6. Moving down to y=0 would require 6 steps.

So total moves:

Move 1: UP → (0,6)

Moves 2-7: RIGHT ×6 → (6,6) [moves 2,3,4,5,6,7]

Moves 8-13: DOWN ×6 → (6,0) [moves 8,9,10,11,12,13]

But wait, does this path collide with the body?

After each move right, the body shifts. So after six moves right, from x=0 to x=6 at y=6, then moving down.

At that point, the body would be:

Head: (6,6)

Body parts: (5,6), (4,6), ..., (0,6) [from right moves], and then continuing back along previous path.

Wait no—the body is built from all previous positions except the last one, which is removed unless eating.

So after six right moves, the snake would have extended to (6,6), and its body would be from (5,6) down to wherever it came from initially.

But I think in this case, moving straight right then straight down wouldn't cause self-collision because the path is a rectangle without crossing over itself.

Alternatively, perhaps not—depending on how the body segments follow.

Wait, when you move right six times, each time the head moves and the tail follows unless you eat something. Since we're not eating anything here, the tail just keeps moving forward.

So after six right moves from (0,6) to (6,6), the body would be:

Segments at (5,6), (4,6), ..., (0,6). Then when moving down, each move adds a new head position and removes the last segment unless eating.

But in this case, since we're not eating, the tail just moves forward.

Wait no—each time you move, the snake's body shifts. So after six right moves:

- Move 1: (0,6)

- Move 2: (1,6), body is [ (0,6) ]

- Move 3: (2,6), body is [ (1,6), (0,6) ]

...

- Move 7: (6,6), body is [ (5,6), (4,6), ..., (0,6) ]

So when moving down from (6,6) to (6,5):

- New head at (6,5)

- Body becomes [ (6,6), (5,6), ..., (1,6) ] plus the previous tail up to (0,6) is removed? Or does it get longer?

Wait no—each move adds a new head and drops the last segment if not eating.

Since we're not growing, each right or down move just shifts the body.

So when moving from (6,6) to (6,5), the body segments would be:

(6,6), (5,6), ..., (1,6). Then as we move down, the new head is (6,5), and the tail becomes (0,6)—no, that can't be. Because each time you move, the previous head becomes part of the body.

Wait I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to realize that in order to reach (6,0) without hitting itself, the snake needs a clear path that doesn't loop back on itself.

Given that, moving right then down seems possible, but perhaps another initial move would be better.

Another idea: Maybe first move DOWN to (0,4), then move RIGHT to 6,4, then move DOWN to 6,0.

Let's see:

Move 1: DOWN from (0,5) → (0,4)

Move 2: RIGHT from (0,4) → (1,4)

...

Move 7: RIGHT → (6,4)

Then Move 8: DOWN → (6,3)

...

Move 12: DOWN → (6,0)

Total moves: 12.

But let's check for self-collision.

After move 1: head at (0,4), body is [ (0,5) ]

Move 2: right to (1,4), body [ (0,4), (0,5) ]? No—each move removes the last segment unless eating. So after moving right from (0,4), the body would be [ (1,4), (0,4) ], but that might not be accurate.

Wait no—the initial body after first move:

After move 1: head at (0,4), body is [ (0,5) ] because we moved down from (0,5).

Then move 2: right to (1,4). Now the body would be [ (0,4) ], because moving right adds a new head and removes the last segment.

Wait no—snake movement typically keeps all segments except the tail. So when you move, the head moves forward, and each segment follows the previous one. The tail either stays or moves depending on whether food is eaten.

But in this case, since we're not growing, each move shifts the entire body forward by one.

So after first move: from (0,5) → (0,4). Body is [ (0,5) ] (since it's just moved down and hasn't added anything yet).

Wait no—that doesn't make sense. The snake must have a body that follows its path.

Perhaps I need to think differently: the snake has multiple segments. Each time you move, the head moves forward, and each segment follows the previous one. If there's no food, the tail also moves forward, effectively keeping the length the same.

So in this problem, unless specified otherwise, perhaps the snake doesn't grow, so moving causes the entire body to shift forward.

But I'm not sure about the exact rules here.

Assuming that the snake can't hit any part of its own body except for the tail which moves each time.

Therefore, when planning the path, we need to make sure that when moving towards the apple, the current head position doesn't coincide with any other segment except perhaps the last one which will move away.

Given that complexity, maybe the shortest path is best: six right and five down moves, but making sure that the path doesn't intersect itself.

But given that, perhaps moving right first would be better.

Alternatively, let me outline the steps clearly:

Option A: Move UP first, then RIGHT, then DOWN.

1. (0,5) → (0,6)
2. (0,6) → (1,6)
3. (1,6) → (2,6)
4. (2,6) → (3,6)
5. (3,6) → (4,6)
6. (4,6) → (5,6)
7. (5,6) → (6,6)
8. (6,6) → (6,5)
9. (6,5) → (6,4)
10. (6,4) → (6,3)
11. (6,3) → (6,2)
12. (6,2) → (6,1)
13. (6,1) → (6,0)

Total moves: 8? Wait, from (0,5) to (0,6) is move 1; then 6 moves right, then 5 moves down.

Wait no—each step is a single move. So total moves would be:

UP (1), RIGHT ×6 (2-7), DOWN ×5 (8-12). Total: 12 moves.

But does this path cause any self-collision?

When moving from (0,6) to the right, each subsequent position shouldn't interfere with previous positions because they are moving in a straight line. Then when starting to move down from (6,6), the positions would be:

(6,5), (6,4), ..., which are new and not yet part of the body.

But wait—the body is shifting as we move. So after each right move, the previous segments follow. When moving down, the head moves into a new row, while the rest of the body follows.

It might be safe as long as there's no overlapping in the path.

Alternatively, perhaps Option B: Move DOWN first, then RIGHT, then DOWN.

1. (0,5) → (0,4)
2. (0,4) → (1,4)
...
7. (6,4) → (6,3)
8. (6,3) → (6,2)
9. (6,2) → (6,1)
10. (6,1) → (6,0)

Wait that's only 10 moves, but does this work?

After move 1: head at (0,4), body [ (0,5) ]

Move 2: right to (1,4); body [ (0,4) ]

But I'm not sure how the body segments are handled.

Perhaps regardless of direction, moving in a straight line and then another straight line without turning back would prevent self-collision.

Therefore, either Option A or B could work.

Given that, perhaps the answer is to move UP once, then RIGHT six times, then DOWN five times, totaling 12 moves.

But I need to check if there's any overlap in these positions.

Alternatively, maybe a different path is needed where after moving right and down, the snake doesn't intersect itself.

Wait, but in both options A and B, as long as the movement is straight lines without crossing over previous paths, it should be fine.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves required is 12: UP, RIGHT six times, DOWN five times.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path by moving differently.

But considering that you need to move from (0,5) to (6,0), which requires at least 6 right and 5 down moves, totaling 11 moves. But each move is either in one direction or another, so the minimal number of moves would be 6 + 5 = 11.

But wait—each move changes only one coordinate by 1. So from (0,5) to (6,0), you need at least |6-0| + |0 -5| = 6+5=11 moves, but since you can't move diagonally, it's exactly 11 moves.

But in reality, the snake has to make each of these moves sequentially, changing direction as needed.

However, considering that the problem allows for any path, not necessarily Manhattan distance, perhaps the minimal number is 11, but I think the initial approach was correct with 12 moves due to movement mechanics.

Wait no—the minimal number of steps is indeed 6 right and 5 down, totaling 11 moves. So why did I count UP first? Maybe that's not necessary if you can move directly.

Wait, starting at (0,5), target is (6,0). To get there, need to go right 6 and down 5.

So the minimal path is Right ×6 and Down ×5 in some order.

But each move must be a single step in one direction.

Therefore, total moves: 11.

But when actually making the moves:

- First, you have to decide whether to go up or right. But from (0,5), moving down would take you away from the target y-coordinate of 0.

Wait—no, because starting at y=5, you need to reach y=0, which requires moving down 5 times. So regardless of when you do it, you need to move down five times and right six times.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves is indeed 11: 6 rights and 5 downs in some order.

But in the initial plan, I thought of moving UP first, which would increase y-coordinate, making it further away. So that's not optimal.

So perhaps the correct approach is to move DOWN first five times, then RIGHT six times.

Wait no—if you move down first from (0,5) to (0,4), then right to 6,4; but to reach y=0, you need to continue moving down.

Alternatively, it's more efficient to move in a straight line towards the target.

But since movement is step-by-step and can't teleport, perhaps any path that combines the required steps will do.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves is 11: six rights and five downs, regardless of order.

So the answer should be \boxed{11}.

Wait but earlier I thought about 12 because of movement mechanics, but actually, the minimal number is 11 as per Manhattan distance.

I think I confused myself earlier by considering UP first, which isn't necessary. The optimal path is moving right and down only, without unnecessary moves.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves required is 6 + 5 = 11.
</think>

The shortest path from (0, 5) to (6, 0) requires moving right six times and down five times, totaling 11 moves. 

$\boxed{11}$

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (6, 0). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
