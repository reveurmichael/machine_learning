<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to move the snake from (9,3) to eat the apple at (0,2). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (9,3), which is near the top-right corner. The direction is currently "UP", but wait, looking back, the initial direction was given as "NONE". No, wait, no—the inputs say the current direction is "UP". Hmm, that's important because I can't reverse direction immediately. So if the current direction is UP, I can't go DOWN next.

The body cells are [(9,2), (8,2)]. So the snake is moving right? Wait, no—since the head is at (9,3) and the first body cell is (9,2), which is directly below. Oh wait, because the coordinate system has (0,0) as bottom-left and (9,9) as top-right. So moving up increases y.

So the snake's body is behind the head: after the head at (9,3), the next segment is (9,2), then (8,2). That suggests that the snake was previously moving down because from (9,3) to (9,2) is down. Wait no—the current direction is UP, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the current direction is "UP", meaning the head is currently moving up. So if the body cells are [(9,2), (8,2)], that implies that the snake's body is following a path from (9,3) down to (9,2), then left to (8,2). Hmm, but since the current direction is UP, I'm confused.

Wait no—maybe the movement direction affects where the next body cell comes. If the head is moving up, the next body part would be at (9,4), but in this case, it's (9,2). So perhaps the snake was previously moving down and then turned around? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body cells are ordered.

Wait, the body list goes from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the head is at (9,3), the next segment is (9,2), which is directly below. Then the next is (8,2), which is left. So perhaps the snake was moving down and then turned left.

But regardless, I need to plan a path from (9,3) to (0,2). Let's look at the positions.

The apple is at (0,2), which is in column 0, row 2. The head is at (9,3), so it needs to move significantly left and slightly down or up depending on how the y-coordinate works.

Wait, y increases going up, so from (9,3) to (0,2) would require moving left 9 units and down 1 unit in terms of grid movement. But let me calculate Manhattan distance: |9-0| + |3-2| = 9+1=10.

So the snake needs to make a total of 10 steps, but considering possible body growth when eating apples, which can increase the length and thus the path needed.

But first, I need to figure out how the body moves. The current body is two segments: (9,2) and (8,2). So if the head moves in a certain direction, the body will follow by adding the previous head position to the front of the body list, unless it's eating an apple.

Wait, no—when moving normally, after computing new_head, the old head is inserted at the front of the body list. Then, if not eating, the tail is removed. So each move shifts the body forward by one, unless the snake eats the apple, in which case the body grows.

So currently, the snake has a length of 3: head + two body segments. When it moves towards the apple, depending on whether it hits the apple, the body will either stay the same length or grow.

Now, the challenge is to plan a path that gets the head from (9,3) to (0,2), ensuring that each new head position doesn't collide with any body segment except possibly the tail when moving.

Also, since the current direction is UP, I can't move DOWN next. So my first move must not be DOWN.

Looking at the initial position, head at (9,3). The body segments are at (9,2) and (8,2). So if I try to go LEFT, which would take me to (8,3), that's safe because it doesn't collide with any body segment. Let's check:

- New head: (8,3)
- Check collision: None of the body segments are at (8,3) except maybe after movement.

Wait, but before moving, I need to check if new_head is in the body cells except possibly the tail. The current body list is [(9,2), (8,2)], which doesn't include (8,3). So it's safe to move left.

So first move: LEFT.

After that, the body will insert the old head (9,3) at the front, making the body [(9,3), (9,2), (8,2)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (8,2). So the new body is [(9,3), (9,2)].

Now the head is at (8,3), and the direction is LEFT. Next move: since current direction is LEFT, I can't reverse to RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

If I go LEFT again, to (7,3). Check collision: body segments are (9,3) and (9,2). No conflict. So safe.

But let's think about the path. The apple is at (0,2), which is much further left. But we have to get there while managing the body so that it doesn't block our path.

Alternatively, perhaps I should go down first to avoid getting stuck.

Wait, but from (9,3), moving LEFT to (8,3) is possible. Then, next move can be DOWN, which would take me to (8,2). But wait, the body after first move includes (9,3), (9,2), and then when we go down again.

Wait no—after the first move to (8,3), the body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)], since the tail was removed. So if I move DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2), that's where the old tail was, but in this new state, the body is [(9,3), (9,2)]. So moving down to (8,2) would collide with nothing because (9,2) is not at (8,2). But wait, after inserting the head into the body list, and then moving, does the tail change?

Wait, perhaps I need to model this step by step.

First move: direction LEFT from (9,3) → new_head (8,3).

Check collision: safe.

Update body:

a. Insert old head (9,3) at front → body becomes [(9,3), (9,2), (8,2)].

b. Check if new_head is apple? The apple is at (0,2), so no. So remove tail (8,2). New body: [(9,3), (9,2)].

So after first move, the snake is at head (8,3) and body [(9,3), (9,2)].

Next move options: since current direction is LEFT, can't go RIGHT. So possible directions: UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

If I go LEFT again to (7,3). Then:

- new_head (7,3).
- Check collision: body segments are at (9,3) and (9,2), so no.
- Insert old head (8,3) → body becomes [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2)].
- Not eating apple, so remove tail (9,2). Body becomes [(8,3), (9,3)].

This seems okay. But I'm not making progress towards the apple which is at x=0, y=2. So moving left twice might be counterproductive because it's going away from the apple.

Alternatively, maybe after first move to (8,3), next move down to (8,2).

But let's see: current body after first move is [(9,3), (9,2)]. Moving DOWN from (8,3) would take me to (8,2). Does this collide with any body segments?

Body is [(9,3), (9,2)], which doesn't include (8,2), so it's safe.

After moving down:

- new_head (8,2).
- Insert old head (8,3) → body becomes [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2)].
- Not eating apple, remove tail (9,2). Body is now [(8,3), (9,3)].

Wait, but the body after inserting and removing would be: after inserting (8,3) at front, it's [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2)]. Then we check if new_head is apple? No. So remove tail (9,2). So body becomes [(8,3), (9,3)].

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the length remains 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after inserting, it's three segments, and then removing one makes it two again. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Perhaps I should try to model each move step by step, ensuring that the path doesn't get blocked and that we eventually reach (0,2).

Another approach: since the apple is at (0,2), which is far left on column 0, row 2. So from (9,3), to get there, the snake needs to go all the way left, but it's currently heading up or down.

Wait, maybe I should first move down to (9,4)? Wait no—y increases as we go up, so (9,3) is higher than (9,2). So moving UP from (9,3) would take it to (9,4), but the current direction is UP. But wait, the initial direction was given as "UP", so the first move can't be DOWN.

So let's reorient: current direction is UP, so I cannot immediately reverse to DOWN.

Therefore, my options for the first move are LEFT or RIGHT or UP? Wait no—the directions are four-way movement: up, down, left, right. So when moving, you choose a new direction that's not opposite unless allowed after some steps.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, can't reverse immediately from UP to DOWN, but other moves are possible.

So first move options: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

If I go UP from (9,3) → (9,4). Is this safe? The body is [(9,2), (8,2)], so no collision. Then after moving up:

- new_head (9,4).
- Insert old head (9,3) into body: [(9,3), (9,2), (8,2)].
- Check if new_head is apple? No.
- Remove tail (8,2). Body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)].

So now the snake's head is at (9,4), moving up. Next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again.

But this seems to be taking us away from the apple at (0,2). So maybe not the best path.

Alternatively, first move LEFT to (8,3). As before.

Then, next move DOWN to (8,2). That's closer to the apple. Then, continue moving left as much as possible.

Wait, after first move: head at (8,3), body [(9,3), (9,2)].

Second move: DOWN to (8,2).

Check collision: body is [(9,3), (9,2)], no conflict.

Insert old head (8,3) → body becomes [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2)].

Not eating apple, remove tail (9,2). Body becomes [(8,3), (9,3)].

Now head is at (8,2).

Next move can be LEFT, as current direction is DOWN (wait no—the last movement was DOWN, so current direction is now DOWN. So I can't go UP next.

Wait, the direction changes based on where you move. If I moved from LEFT to DOWN, then current direction becomes DOWN after that move. Wait, perhaps not—directions are updated each time you make a move.

So when I first move LEFT, current direction is now LEFT.

Then, moving DOWN would change the direction to DOWN.

Wait, no—the problem states that the current direction affects what you can do next. So in this case, after first move is LEFT, next moves cannot be RIGHT unless it's not opposite? Or perhaps only immediate reversals are forbidden.

I think the rule is that you can't reverse direction immediately. So from UP, you can't go DOWN; but other directions are allowed.

Wait, let me clarify: when moving, if the current direction is D, then you cannot choose the opposite of D (e.g., from UP to DOWN or vice versa). You can choose any other direction, including continuing in the same direction.

So after first move LEFT, the current direction is LEFT. So next moves cannot be RIGHT.

Therefore, after moving LEFT to (8,3), next possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

If I then move DOWN to (8,2), that's allowed because current direction is LEFT, and DOWN is not opposite.

So now head is at (8,2). Next moves can't be RIGHT. So options: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.

But moving further down might not help since the apple is at y=2. Alternatively, move left again to (7,2), but wait, in this case, after moving to (8,2), if I go LEFT again:

- new_head (7,2).
- Check collision: body segments are [(8,3), (9,3)].
- So no conflict.

Insert old head (8,2) → body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (9,3)].

Not eating apple, so remove tail (9,3). Body is now [(8,2), (8,3)].

So after third move, head at (7,2), direction LEFT.

Continuing this way seems tedious, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, another approach: since the apple is in column 0, we need to navigate all the way left through columns 9 to 0. The snake's body could potentially block the path if not managed carefully.

But considering that each move shifts the body and possibly grows it when eating apples, I need to plan a path where the body doesn't block the path towards (0,2).

Wait, but initially, the apple is at (0,2), so maybe we can plan to go directly left in a straight line until reaching x=0, then adjust y accordingly.

But given that the head starts at (9,3), moving directly left would take it to (8,3), (7,3), etc., down to (0,3). Then from there, move down or up to reach (0,2).

However, considering the body movement and potential apple eating, this could work.

So first moves: LEFT all the way to (0,3). Let's see:

First move: LEFT → (8,3)

Second move: LEFT → (7,3)

Third move: LEFT → (6,3), etc., until reaching (0,3).

But each time moving left, we add a segment on the body. However, once we reach (0,3), to get to (0,2), we need to move down.

Wait, but after eating the apple at (0,2), which is one step down from (0,3), the snake would grow by one segment.

But how does this affect the path?

Alternatively, perhaps moving left until x=1, then moving down into (0,2). But I need to model each move carefully.

Wait, but in reality, after each move, the body shifts, and if we eat an apple, the body grows. So eating apples can make the snake longer, which might block the path if not managed.

But since there's only one apple at (0,2), maybe it's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a spiral or some pattern to avoid collision.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a sequence of moves that gets me from (9,3) to (0,2) without colliding with the body.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move LEFT from (9,3) → (8,3)
2. Move DOWN from (8,3) → (8,2)
3. Move LEFT from (8,2) → (7,2)
4. Move LEFT from (7,2) → (6,2)
... continue moving left until x=0.

But wait, when moving down to (8,2), then moving left, the body will follow and could potentially block the path.

Alternatively, perhaps after reaching (8,2), move further left but also manage the y-coordinate to reach (0,2).

This is getting too vague. Maybe I should write out each step with the resulting positions.

Let's try:

Move 1: LEFT from (9,3) → (8,3)
Body becomes [(9,3), (9,2)]
Direction now LEFT

Move 2: DOWN from (8,3) → (8,2)
Body after inserting old head (8,3): [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2)]
Not eating apple, remove tail (9,2). Body is [(8,3), (9,3)]
Direction now DOWN

Move 3: LEFT from (8,2) → (7,2)
Body after inserting old head (8,2): [(8,2), (8,3), (9,3)]
Not eating apple, remove tail (9,3). Body is [(8,2), (8,3)]
Direction now LEFT

Move 4: LEFT from (7,2) → (6,2)
Body after inserting old head (7,2): [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3)]
Not eating apple, remove tail (8,3). Body is [(7,2), (8,2)]

Move 5: LEFT from (6,2) → (5,2)
Body becomes [(6,2), (7,2), (8,2)] after inserting, then remove tail (8,2). So body is [(6,2), (7,2)]

This continues until:

Move 9: LEFT from (1,2) → (0,2)

Now, head is at (0,2), which is the apple's position. So it eats the apple.

After eating the apple:

- Insert old head (1,2) into body list.
- Body becomes [(1,2), (2,2), ..., (7,2)]
- Since we ate an apple, the snake grows by one segment; so tail isn't removed.

Thus, the body is now [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2), ..., (8,3)]? Wait, no—the insertion happens at each step, and since it's the first time eating the apple, the body doesn't remove the tail.

Wait, let me clarify: when you eat an apple, your size increases by one unit, so effectively, you don't lose the last segment. So after eating, the body becomes all previous segments plus the new head, making it longer.

Therefore, in this case, after moving to (0,2), which is the apple's location:

- The snake's body would be [(1,2), (2,2), ..., (8,2)] and head at (0,2). But since it ate an apple, it doesn't remove the tail. So the body becomes [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2), ..., (8,3)].

Wait, no—the exact insertion would depend on previous steps.

Actually, let's retrace:

After Move 9: head is at (0,2). Before this move, the body was [(1,2)]. Wait, no—each move adds a segment and may remove one if not eating an apple. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, each time you move to a new position that isn't an apple, the body shifts: the head moves, and the tail is removed (unless an apple is eaten). When an apple is eaten, the tail remains, so the snake grows by one segment.

So let's correct:

Move 1: LEFT → (8,3)
Body after Move 1: [(9,2), (8,3)] ? Wait no—the body starts as [(9,2), (8,2)], but moving to (8,3) adds a new head and the tail remains?

Wait, perhaps I should model each move's effect on the body.

Initial state:

- Head: (9,3)
- Body: [ (9,2), (8,2) ]

Because when you start, after being at (9,3), your previous positions are (9,2) and (8,2).

Move 1: LEFT → new head at (8,3). Body becomes [(9,3), (9,2), (8,2)]. But since we moved to a new position without eating an apple, the tail is removed. So body is now [(9,3), (9,2)].

Wait no—each move adds the new head and removes the last segment unless it's an apple.

So perhaps:

- Start: positions = [ (9,3) ], body = [ (9,2), (8,2) ]
But actually, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

At any time, the snake is represented by a list of coordinates, starting from head to tail.

Each move shifts this list: the head moves in the chosen direction, and the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

If an apple is eaten at the new head position, then the tail isn't removed, so the snake grows.

In our case:

Initial positions (before any moves):

Assuming the snake's body starts as [(9,3), (9,2), (8,2)]. Wait, no—the initial problem doesn't specify. Let me check.

Wait, the initial state is that the snake is at position (9,3). The previous positions are (9,2) and (8,2). So before any moves, the body is [ (9,2), (8,2) ], with head at (9,3).

So each move:

1. Choose a direction not opposite to current direction.
2. Move the head in that direction.
3. Check if new head position has an apple:
   - If yes: add new head without removing tail → snake grows by 1.
   - If no: add new head and remove last body segment.

So let's model step by step:

Initial state:

- Head: (9,3)
- Body: [ (9,2), (8,2) ]
- Current direction: not set yet? Or is it initial?

Wait, the problem says current direction is UP. So initial direction is UP.

Move 1: Can't go DOWN (opposite of UP). So can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

Let's choose LEFT:

New head position: (8,3)

Check if (8,3) has apple? No, since the apple is at (0,2).

So add new head to body and remove last segment.

Body becomes [ (9,3), (9,2), (8,2) ] → no, wait:

Wait, initial body after moving LEFT once:

- New head: (8,3)
- Old body was [ (9,2), (8,2) ]
- So new body is [ (8,3), (9,2), (8,2) ]? No—because when you move, the tail is removed if no apple.

Wait, perhaps each time you move:

1. New head = current head + direction.
2. If new head is apple: add to body without removing tail.
3. Else: add new head and remove last segment.

So initial state:

- Head: (9,3)
- Body: [ (9,2), (8,2) ]

Move 1: LEFT → new head (8,3). Not an apple.

Body becomes [ (8,3) ] + body[:-1] = [ (8,3), (9,2) ]

So now:

- Head: (8,3)
- Body: [ (9,2) ]
Wait, that can't be right. Because moving from (9,3) to (8,3), the previous position was (9,3), so perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, maybe body is a deque where new head is added and tail is popped unless eating apple.

So initial deque: [ (9,2), (8,2) ]

Head is at (9,3). Wait, perhaps the initial setup is:

- The snake's head is at (9,3)
- Body segments are [ (9,2), (8,2) ]
- So the deque is [ (9,2), (8,2) ]

When moving LEFT to (8,3):

- New head: (8,3)
- Since it's not an apple, add new head and remove tail.

So deque becomes [ (8,3), (9,2) ] after popping (8,2).

Thus:

- Head: (8,3)
- Body: [ (9,2) ]
Wait, that seems too short. The snake was initially two segments plus head? Or is the initial body just the previous positions.

I think I'm getting confused about how the body is represented.

Let me clarify:

Each time you move, you add a new segment at the front (head) and remove one from the end (tail), unless an apple is eaten. So if there's no apple, the length remains same. If you eat an apple, the tail isn't removed, so snake grows by 1.

So initial setup:

- Head: (9,3)
- Body segments: [ (9,2), (8,2) ]

Move 1: LEFT to (8,3). Not an apple.

So new head is (8,3). Add it, remove the tail (8,2).

Body becomes [ (8,3), (9,2) ].

Direction changes to LEFT.

Move 2: DOWN from (8,3) → (8,2). Is there an apple? No.

Add new head (8,2). Remove tail (9,2).

Body becomes [ (8,2), (8,3) ]

But wait, the previous body was [ (8,3), (9,2) ] before this move. After adding new head and removing tail, it's [ (8,2), (8,3) ].

Move 3: LEFT from (8,2) → (7,2). No apple.

Add to front: [ (7,2), (8,2), (8,3) ]

Remove tail (8,3).

So body becomes [ (7,2), (8,2) ]

Direction now LEFT.

Move 4: LEFT from (7,2) → (6,2). No apple.

Body: [ (6,2), (7,2), (8,2) ] → after removing tail (8,2): [ (6,2), (7,2) ]

Wait no:

Each move adds new head to front and removes tail if no apple.

So from Move 3, body is [ (7,2), (8,2) ]

Move 4: LEFT to (6,2). Add to front → [ (6,2), (7,2), (8,2) ] then remove tail (8,2).

Body becomes [ (6,2), (7,2) ]

Yes.

Continue:

Move 5: LEFT from (6,2) → (5,2). No apple.

Add to front → [ (5,2), (6,2), (7,2) ], remove tail (7,2).

Body becomes [ (5,2), (6,2) ]

This pattern continues until:

Move 9: LEFT from (1,2) → (0,2). Is there an apple at (0,2)? Yes.

So new head is (0,2). Since it's the apple position, we don't remove tail.

Thus, body becomes [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), ..., (8,3) ] ?

Wait no:

Let me track step by step with counts.

Each move without eating an apple keeps the length same. From initial 3 segments (head + two body parts):

- Move 1: LEFT → head at (8,3). Body: [ (9,2), (8,3) ] ? No, wait:

Wait I'm getting too confused. Maybe it's better to consider that each move adds one segment and removes one unless an apple is eaten.

So initial segments: 3 (head + two body)

After Move 1: LEFT → segments remain 3, as we added head but removed tail.

But since the initial direction was UP, moving LEFT is allowed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

Each move, regardless of whether you eat an apple, adds a new head. If no apple, the tail is popped. If apple, tail remains, so length increases by 1.

So let's count segments:

- Start: head at (9,3), body [ (9,2), (8,2) ] → total 3 segments.
- Move 1: LEFT to (8,3). Not apple. So add new head, remove tail. Body becomes [ (8,3), (9,2) ] → still 3 segments.
- Move 2: DOWN to (8,2). Not apple. Add new head, remove tail. Body becomes [ (8,2), (8,3) ] → still 3.
- Move 3: LEFT to (7,2). Add head, remove tail. Body [ (7,2), (8,2) ] → 3.
- ...
- Move 9: LEFT to (0,2). Apple eaten. So add new head without removing tail. Now body has 4 segments.

Thus, after eating the apple at move 9, the snake's body is:

[ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), ..., (8,3) ] ? Not sure about exact order.

But regardless, once the snake eats the apple, it can continue moving without restrictions on size until the next collision.

So after eating the apple at (0,2), the snake's head is at (0,2), and body extends back to previous positions.

Now, after that, suppose the snake continues moving in some direction. But as per problem, once the apple is eaten, the game ends because you can't move further without overlapping.

But wait, does eating the apple end the game? Or do we continue until collision?

The question says "You are to find out whether the snake will be able to eat all the apples in this scenario."

So perhaps the process continues until either all apples are eaten or the snake collides with itself.

But in our case, there's only one apple at (0,2). So once it's eaten, the snake can't proceed further because any move would cause collision.

Therefore, the answer is that yes, the snake can eat all apples. But wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, after eating the apple, if the snake continues moving in a direction that causes self-collision, then it dies before eating more apples. So in this case, since there's only one apple, once eaten, the game ends successfully.

But let me check the exact positions.

After move 9: head at (0,2), body segments [ (1,2), (2,2), ..., (8,3) ] ? Or is it different.

Actually, when moving from (1,2) to (0,2):

- Previous body was [ (1,2), (2,2), ..., (x,y) ]
Wait, no. Each move adds the new head and, if not an apple, removes tail.

But since (0,2) is an apple, it's added without removing tail.

So after eating the apple at (0,2):

- Head: (0,2)
- Body: [ (1,2), (2,2), ..., (8,3) ]

Which means the snake's body is from (0,2) back to (8,3). So when the head moves into a position that causes collision with any part of its own body.

But since after eating the apple, if it tries to move again, it will have to go in some direction. Let's say it continues moving LEFT from (0,2), but can't because it's at x=0.

Alternatively, if it moves UP or DOWN:

From (0,2):

- Moving UP would take it to (0,3). Is that a valid move? Not sure about grid boundaries.
- Moving DOWN would be (0,1).

Assuming the grid is large enough, let's say it moves DOWN to (0,1). Now, check if (0,1) is in body.

The current body after eating apple is [ (1,2), (2,2), ..., (8,3) ] and head at (0,2).

Wait no—the body after eating the apple would be all previous positions plus the new head without removing tail.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that once the snake eats the first apple, it's stuck because any further move will cause collision.

But actually, since the only apple was at (0,2), and after eating it, the game ends as all apples are eaten.

Therefore, the answer is YES, the snake can eat all apples.

The snake can successfully navigate to the apple without colliding with itself. Once it eats the apple, the process completes as there are no more apples to collect.

**Answer:** \boxed{Yes}

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (9, 3) and whose body cells are in list format [(9, 2), (8, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (0, 2). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
