00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,190
new Block City
buildings so one of the first things I

8
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:10,200
buildings so one of the first things I
 

9
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,950
buildings so one of the first things I
want to talk about is that um many of

10
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
want to talk about is that um many of
 

11
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,430
want to talk about is that um many of
these buildings I built at various

12
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
these buildings I built at various
 

13
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,830
these buildings I built at various
different scales so these all appear in

14
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
different scales so these all appear in
 

15
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,189
different scales so these all appear in
the uh spelt interview when mfos is

16
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:20,199
the uh spelt interview when mfos is
 

17
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,750
the uh spelt interview when mfos is
using them like dominoes to knock each

18
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
using them like dominoes to knock each
 

19
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,630
using them like dominoes to knock each
other down and a trick I used is that at

20
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
other down and a trick I used is that at
 

21
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,630
other down and a trick I used is that at
the end of one shot I might have a

22
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
the end of one shot I might have a
 

23
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,830
the end of one shot I might have a
building this size being knocked down by

24
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
building this size being knocked down by
 

25
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,710
building this size being knocked down by
something and then next shot I would cut

26
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
something and then next shot I would cut
 

27
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,429
something and then next shot I would cut
to something that was this size which is

28
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:32,439
to something that was this size which is
 

29
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,389
to something that was this size which is
supposed to be the same building but it

30
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
supposed to be the same building but it
 

31
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,150
supposed to be the same building but it
allowed me to change from various scales

32
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,160
allowed me to change from various scales
 

33
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,910
allowed me to change from various scales
so that's how I uh sort of pulled that

34
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
so that's how I uh sort of pulled that
 

35
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,150
so that's how I uh sort of pulled that
off and um in the description I'll link

36
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
off and um in the description I'll link
 

37
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,750
off and um in the description I'll link
to a page where I talk about that a

38
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
to a page where I talk about that a
 

39
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,229
to a page where I talk about that a
little bit more but um this little guy

40
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
little bit more but um this little guy
 

41
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,189
little bit more but um this little guy
is just

42
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:48,199
is just
 

43
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,270
is just
uh alternating rows of uh clear 1X two

44
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
uh alternating rows of uh clear 1X two
 

45
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,990
uh alternating rows of uh clear 1X two
plates and tan 2x3 plates so Al together

46
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,000
plates and tan 2x3 plates so Al together
 

47
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,029
plates and tan 2x3 plates so Al together
it's 1 2 3 4 five six 7 eight nine 10 11

48
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:02,039
it's 1 2 3 4 five six 7 eight nine 10 11
 

49
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,030
it's 1 2 3 4 five six 7 eight nine 10 11
there so Al together it's 2 4 6 8 10 12

50
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
there so Al together it's 2 4 6 8 10 12
 

51
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,310
there so Al together it's 2 4 6 8 10 12
14 16 18 19 tall and then this guy over

52
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
14 16 18 19 tall and then this guy over
 

53
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,390
14 16 18 19 tall and then this guy over
here is just about uh three times that

54
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
here is just about uh three times that
 

55
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,590
here is just about uh three times that
size so uh around the clear level are

56
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
size so uh around the clear level are
 

57
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,270
size so uh around the clear level are
two tall um 1 by two clear plates and

58
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
two tall um 1 by two clear plates and
 

59
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,590
two tall um 1 by two clear plates and
I've got three

60
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
I've got three
 

61
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,749
I've got three
2x4s to make a uh

62
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
2x4s to make a uh
 

63
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,870
2x4s to make a uh
4x6 and down here I actually have a 4x6

64
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
4x6 and down here I actually have a 4x6
 

65
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,069
4x6 and down here I actually have a 4x6
so again it's just a whole bunch of

66
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,079
so again it's just a whole bunch of
 

67
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,350
so again it's just a whole bunch of
layers of that uh I think I just did as

68
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
layers of that uh I think I just did as
 

69
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,469
layers of that uh I think I just did as
many as I had tan plates to do it with

70
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
many as I had tan plates to do it with
 

71
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,230
many as I had tan plates to do it with
but uh you can see that these uh

72
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,240
but uh you can see that these uh
 

73
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,670
but uh you can see that these uh
basically same idea but on smaller

74
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:48,680
basically same idea but on smaller
 

75
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,030
basically same idea but on smaller
scales uh similarly this little black

76
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,040
scales uh similarly this little black
 

77
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,030
scales uh similarly this little black
building is uh supposed to be the same

78
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
building is uh supposed to be the same
 

79
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,990
building is uh supposed to be the same
thing as this big black

80
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
thing as this big black
 

81
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,310
thing as this big black
building hold on for a second

82
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,320
building hold on for a second
 

83
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,109
building hold on for a second
it's hard to see black of course but uh

84
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:04,119
it's hard to see black of course but uh
 

85
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:05,550
it's hard to see black of course but uh
so this little

86
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:05,560
so this little
 

87
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,430
so this little
guy he's got uh this is two 1x4 plates a

88
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,440
guy he's got uh this is two 1x4 plates a
 

89
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,070
guy he's got uh this is two 1x4 plates a
uh 1x4 Arch that's too tall those are

90
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
uh 1x4 Arch that's too tall those are
 

91
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,910
uh 1x4 Arch that's too tall those are
connected to two 2x4 plate or 2 by sorry

92
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
connected to two 2x4 plate or 2 by sorry
 

93
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,670
connected to two 2x4 plate or 2 by sorry
these are all bricks 2x4 bricks then a

94
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
these are all bricks 2x4 bricks then a
 

95
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,270
these are all bricks 2x4 bricks then a
2x4 plate on top we've got a 1x two

96
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
2x4 plate on top we've got a 1x two
 

97
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,430
2x4 plate on top we've got a 1x two
brick with a little uh roof piece on top

98
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
brick with a little uh roof piece on top
 

99
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,949
brick with a little uh roof piece on top
uh same thing on the other side and then

100
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
uh same thing on the other side and then
 

101
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,390
uh same thing on the other side and then
the middle is a cone with a chees slope

102
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
the middle is a cone with a chees slope
 

103
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,350
the middle is a cone with a chees slope
you can see that it uh has some of the

104
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
you can see that it uh has some of the
 

105
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,670
you can see that it uh has some of the
same ideas is this big guy but just in a

106
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
same ideas is this big guy but just in a
 

107
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,910
same ideas is this big guy but just in a
smaller

108
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
smaller
 

109
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,869
smaller
form and the big one

110
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
form and the big one
 

111
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,190
form and the big one
uh along the back is you know this is

112
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,200
uh along the back is you know this is
 

113
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,869
uh along the back is you know this is
just built up with a lot of

114
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:49,879
just built up with a lot of
 

115
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,149
just built up with a lot of
brick uh but the

116
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:52,159
brick uh but the
 

117
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,229
brick uh but the
bottom I've got this Arch on the inside

118
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:55,239
bottom I've got this Arch on the inside
 

119
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,990
bottom I've got this Arch on the inside
and then arch in front of that which

120
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,000
and then arch in front of that which
 

121
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,270
and then arch in front of that which
I've filled out with brick that connect

122
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
I've filled out with brick that connect
 

123
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,149
I've filled out with brick that connect
down through

124
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:01,159
down through
 

125
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,229
down through
uh and then just got you know this is a

126
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:03,239
uh and then just got you know this is a
 

127
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,149
uh and then just got you know this is a
five tall area so again I'm using the

128
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:05,159
five tall area so again I'm using the
 

129
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,550
five tall area so again I'm using the
tall bricks on the

130
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:07,560
tall bricks on the
 

131
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,830
tall bricks on the
edges so yeah this is just like a um 8X

132
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:12,840
edges so yeah this is just like a um 8X
 

133
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,789
edges so yeah this is just like a um 8X
4X five with a couple arches set into it

134
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
4X five with a couple arches set into it
 

135
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,030
4X five with a couple arches set into it
and up here uh pull off the stuff this

136
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
and up here uh pull off the stuff this
 

137
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,190
and up here uh pull off the stuff this
is just a big uh Castle piece and then

138
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
is just a big uh Castle piece and then
 

139
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,390
is just a big uh Castle piece and then
I've just filled in some

140
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,400
I've just filled in some
 

141
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,429
I've just filled in some
brick behind it

142
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:31,439
brick behind it
 

143
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,710
brick behind it
and then on top we got the uh big nose

144
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:35,720
and then on top we got the uh big nose
 

145
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,710
and then on top we got the uh big nose
cone

146
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,720
cone
 

147
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,869
cone
piece uh top with a cheese slope so same

148
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
piece uh top with a cheese slope so same
 

149
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,750
piece uh top with a cheese slope so same
as the little building but bigger scale

150
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
as the little building but bigger scale
 

151
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,670
as the little building but bigger scale
and this is this weird engine piece uh

152
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,680
and this is this weird engine piece uh
 

153
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,630
and this is this weird engine piece uh
with a cheese slope on the top and then

154
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
with a cheese slope on the top and then
 

155
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,550
with a cheese slope on the top and then
this weird like shoulder pad plate a 2X

156
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
this weird like shoulder pad plate a 2X
 

157
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,110
this weird like shoulder pad plate a 2X
two tile and this uh 2x3 plate with the

158
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,120
two tile and this uh 2x3 plate with the
 

159
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,110
two tile and this uh 2x3 plate with the
round hole on the end

160
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
round hole on the end
 

161
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,589
round hole on the end
and again doing the same thing on both

162
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
and again doing the same thing on both
 

163
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,710
and again doing the same thing on both
sides but in

164
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:05,720
sides but in
 

165
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,990
sides but in
reverse

166
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
reverse
 

167
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,470
reverse
and just sticking the bottom of the

168
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
and just sticking the bottom of the
 

169
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,470
and just sticking the bottom of the
engines on and you get that so yeah

170
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
engines on and you get that so yeah
 

171
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,270
engines on and you get that so yeah
that's that

172
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,280
that's that
 

173
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,629
that's that
building so to fill out the city I have

174
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
building so to fill out the city I have
 

175
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,789
building so to fill out the city I have
a lot of really small simple buildings

176
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
a lot of really small simple buildings
 

177
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,310
a lot of really small simple buildings
that are just one bright color uh you

178
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,320
that are just one bright color uh you
 

179
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,150
that are just one bright color uh you
know I like bright colors that's why I

180
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,160
know I like bright colors that's why I
 

181
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,670
know I like bright colors that's why I
play with Lego so when I was building

182
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
play with Lego so when I was building
 

183
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,710
play with Lego so when I was building
designing new Block City I wanted each

184
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:29,720
designing new Block City I wanted each
 

185
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,150
designing new Block City I wanted each
building to basically be one color so I

186
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
building to basically be one color so I
 

187
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,830
building to basically be one color so I
just took all of my bricks of each color

188
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:34,840
just took all of my bricks of each color
 

189
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,870
just took all of my bricks of each color
and then looked for cool pieces so in t

190
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:37,880
and then looked for cool pieces so in t
 

191
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,390
and then looked for cool pieces so in t
or in lime green I had this

192
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
or in lime green I had this
 

193
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,710
or in lime green I had this
cool uh sort of quarter Circle piece two

194
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:43,720
cool uh sort of quarter Circle piece two
 

195
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,150
cool uh sort of quarter Circle piece two
of those and uh put a little tie on top

196
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
of those and uh put a little tie on top
 

197
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,590
of those and uh put a little tie on top
to hide the studs and then these are

198
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
to hide the studs and then these are
 

199
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,390
to hide the studs and then these are
just some 2x3 bricks down there thought

200
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
just some 2x3 bricks down there thought
 

201
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,430
just some 2x3 bricks down there thought
that looked like a cool little building

202
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,440
that looked like a cool little building
 

203
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,550
that looked like a cool little building
um this is a weird shade of brown that I

204
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
um this is a weird shade of brown that I
 

205
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,270
um this is a weird shade of brown that I
don't think has been in use for a while

206
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,280
don't think has been in use for a while
 

207
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,310
don't think has been in use for a while
never really got used very much to begin

208
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
never really got used very much to begin
 

209
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,430
never really got used very much to begin
with or is this the new nougat color I'm

210
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:02,440
with or is this the new nougat color I'm
 

211
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,350
with or is this the new nougat color I'm
not sure but anyway had these uh big

212
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,360
not sure but anyway had these uh big
 

213
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,990
not sure but anyway had these uh big
slopes just made them go alternating and

214
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,000
slopes just made them go alternating and
 

215
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,710
slopes just made them go alternating and
then just filled out the bottom and top

216
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
then just filled out the bottom and top
 

217
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,150
then just filled out the bottom and top
with some bricks and again when it's off

218
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
with some bricks and again when it's off
 

219
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,909
with some bricks and again when it's off
at a distance it just looks like a a

220
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
at a distance it just looks like a a
 

221
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,350
at a distance it just looks like a a
building and then this is

222
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,360
building and then this is
 

223
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,590
building and then this is
a a weird shade of purple more magenta

224
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
a a weird shade of purple more magenta
 

225
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,749
a a weird shade of purple more magenta
than the dark purple but uh I had a cone

226
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:24,759
than the dark purple but uh I had a cone
 

227
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,590
than the dark purple but uh I had a cone
so 2 by two bricks and a

228
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
so 2 by two bricks and a
 

229
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,830
so 2 by two bricks and a
cone uh some other small

230
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,840
cone uh some other small
 

231
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,350
cone uh some other small
buildings uh my turquoise bricks I had

232
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:34,360
buildings uh my turquoise bricks I had
 

233
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,790
buildings uh my turquoise bricks I had
one of these uh weird guys and uh you

234
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
one of these uh weird guys and uh you
 

235
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,870
one of these uh weird guys and uh you
can stick a plate back into the hole

236
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
can stick a plate back into the hole
 

237
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,790
can stick a plate back into the hole
right there so I did that uh this is you

238
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:43,800
right there so I did that uh this is you
 

239
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,309
right there so I did that uh this is you
know another Hammerhead sort of shape uh

240
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:47,319
know another Hammerhead sort of shape uh
 

241
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,150
know another Hammerhead sort of shape uh
these are the pin connectors from

242
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,160
these are the pin connectors from
 

243
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,950
these are the pin connectors from
Technic I think these are all from the

244
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
Technic I think these are all from the
 

245
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,909
Technic I think these are all from the
old rock Raider series cuz they had

246
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:52,919
old rock Raider series cuz they had
 

247
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,150
old rock Raider series cuz they had
turquoise in it I had a bunch of 1 by

248
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,160
turquoise in it I had a bunch of 1 by
 

249
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,070
turquoise in it I had a bunch of 1 by
tws and uh just topped it off like that

250
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,080
tws and uh just topped it off like that
 

251
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,830
tws and uh just topped it off like that
this uh purple one you'll notice there's

252
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
this uh purple one you'll notice there's
 

253
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,150
this uh purple one you'll notice there's
a little blue in there cuz I didn't have

254
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,160
a little blue in there cuz I didn't have
 

255
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,790
a little blue in there cuz I didn't have
a lot in purple basically it's all held

256
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:07,800
a lot in purple basically it's all held
 

257
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,469
a lot in purple basically it's all held
together by an axle that's anchored on

258
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:09,479
together by an axle that's anchored on
 

259
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,870
together by an axle that's anchored on
those plates and then uh these wheels

260
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:11,880
those plates and then uh these wheels
 

261
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,469
those plates and then uh these wheels
are from the old Night Bus not sure if

262
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
are from the old Night Bus not sure if
 

263
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,550
are from the old Night Bus not sure if
they're on the new one haven't gotten

264
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
they're on the new one haven't gotten
 

265
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,950
they're on the new one haven't gotten
that and then at the bottom again I've

266
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:19,960
that and then at the bottom again I've
 

267
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,309
that and then at the bottom again I've
got a another blue cylinder plate so

268
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
got a another blue cylinder plate so
 

269
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,110
got a another blue cylinder plate so
this can actually attach and then I had

270
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,120
this can actually attach and then I had
 

271
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,309
this can actually attach and then I had
this purple roof piece so uh that just

272
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:27,319
this purple roof piece so uh that just
 

273
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,110
this purple roof piece so uh that just
makes a nice and I like the way the

274
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,120
makes a nice and I like the way the
 

275
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,589
makes a nice and I like the way the
holes you know the gaps between the the

276
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:32,599
holes you know the gaps between the the
 

277
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,870
holes you know the gaps between the the
wheels add some character to the

278
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:35,880
wheels add some character to the
 

279
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,710
wheels add some character to the
building uh you know and it does look

280
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:37,720
building uh you know and it does look
 

281
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,589
building uh you know and it does look
like a building whereas this doesn't

282
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:40,599
like a building whereas this doesn't
 

283
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,870
like a building whereas this doesn't
really look like a building but I think

284
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:41,880
really look like a building but I think
 

285
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,029
really look like a building but I think
it's cool

286
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
it's cool
 

287
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,189
it's cool
anyway uh so this red building is mostly

288
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
anyway uh so this red building is mostly
 

289
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,110
anyway uh so this red building is mostly
just uh this piece and uh you know this

290
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
just uh this piece and uh you know this
 

291
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,189
just uh this piece and uh you know this
is from the old mtron sets but I flipped

292
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:54,199
is from the old mtron sets but I flipped
 

293
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,670
is from the old mtron sets but I flipped
it around so it becomes a w

294
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:56,680
it around so it becomes a w
 

295
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,189
it around so it becomes a w
building and uh then I just filled out

296
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:00,199
building and uh then I just filled out
 

297
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,950
building and uh then I just filled out
the bottom here so that's a 2X two brick

298
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
the bottom here so that's a 2X two brick
 

299
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,670
the bottom here so that's a 2X two brick
some 1X two plates with a 2x3 slope and

300
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:06,680
some 1X two plates with a 2x3 slope and
 

301
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,070
some 1X two plates with a 2x3 slope and
some 1x3 slopes on the side so it fills

302
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
some 1x3 slopes on the side so it fills
 

303
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,430
some 1x3 slopes on the side so it fills
out and sort of looks like

304
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
out and sort of looks like
 

305
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,790
out and sort of looks like
something uh some other small scale

306
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
something uh some other small scale
 

307
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,390
something uh some other small scale
buildings getting a little larger now so

308
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
buildings getting a little larger now so
 

309
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,869
buildings getting a little larger now so
this guy is h a whole bunch of these one

310
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:24,879
this guy is h a whole bunch of these one
 

311
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,430
this guy is h a whole bunch of these one
by two plates with the little uh groove

312
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
by two plates with the little uh groove
 

313
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,390
by two plates with the little uh groove
on the side so so I had a whole bunch of

314
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
on the side so so I had a whole bunch of
 

315
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,830
on the side so so I had a whole bunch of
those and I also had bunch of this 1X

316
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
those and I also had bunch of this 1X
 

317
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,670
those and I also had bunch of this 1X
two plate that has a little ladder so uh

318
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
two plate that has a little ladder so uh
 

319
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,029
two plate that has a little ladder so uh
I just found out what

320
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:40,039
I just found out what
 

321
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,909
I just found out what
height uh you know I needed to have

322
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:42,919
height uh you know I needed to have
 

323
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,550
height uh you know I needed to have
between the ladders to make them all

324
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
between the ladders to make them all
 

325
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,350
between the ladders to make them all
line up nicely and that ended up being

326
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
line up nicely and that ended up being
 

327
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,790
line up nicely and that ended up being
uh five plates tall so I've got groups

328
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:51,800
uh five plates tall so I've got groups
 

329
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,309
uh five plates tall so I've got groups
of five of these that are in between and

330
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
of five of these that are in between and
 

331
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,589
of five of these that are in between and
then at each layer I've got a ladder

332
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:56,599
then at each layer I've got a ladder
 

333
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,230
then at each layer I've got a ladder
brick and a uh 1X two plate

334
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
brick and a uh 1X two plate
 

335
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,350
brick and a uh 1X two plate
and it's just a whole bunch of that unit

336
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,360
and it's just a whole bunch of that unit
 

337
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,589
and it's just a whole bunch of that unit
stacked on top of each other and then

338
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:06,599
stacked on top of each other and then
 

339
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,550
stacked on top of each other and then
uh hold on one second at the top I'm

340
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
uh hold on one second at the top I'm
 

341
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,390
uh hold on one second at the top I'm
using the uh grill plates cuz obviously

342
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
using the uh grill plates cuz obviously
 

343
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,510
using the uh grill plates cuz obviously
we want to continue all these cool lines

344
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:16,520
we want to continue all these cool lines
 

345
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,710
we want to continue all these cool lines
on the

346
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:17,720
on the
 

347
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,790
on the
top uh this dark green building uh you

348
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:21,800
top uh this dark green building uh you
 

349
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,790
top uh this dark green building uh you
know sort of has the shape of a

350
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:23,800
know sort of has the shape of a
 

351
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,990
know sort of has the shape of a
traditional

352
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,000
traditional
 

353
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,909
traditional
skyscraper uh I just had one of these

354
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
skyscraper uh I just had one of these
 

355
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,629
skyscraper uh I just had one of these
pieces you know so goes from 2x two to

356
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
pieces you know so goes from 2x two to
 

357
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,389
pieces you know so goes from 2x two to
1x one and I just stuck one of those

358
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
1x one and I just stuck one of those
 

359
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,670
1x one and I just stuck one of those
long uh 1ex one bricks and on some 2x

360
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
long uh 1ex one bricks and on some 2x
 

361
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,230
long uh 1ex one bricks and on some 2x
two

362
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,240
two
 

363
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,230
two
bricks this uh Brown building highlights

364
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
bricks this uh Brown building highlights
 

365
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,350
bricks this uh Brown building highlights
the uh Treasure Chest at the top which I

366
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,360
the uh Treasure Chest at the top which I
 

367
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,910
the uh Treasure Chest at the top which I
thought was a it's a cool piece to not

368
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:46,920
thought was a it's a cool piece to not
 

369
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,550
thought was a it's a cool piece to not
use for a treasure chest so thought it

370
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:49,560
use for a treasure chest so thought it
 

371
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,310
use for a treasure chest so thought it
had some architectural niceness and then

372
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,320
had some architectural niceness and then
 

373
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,829
had some architectural niceness and then
because it has the little handle on the

374
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839
because it has the little handle on the
 

375
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,910
because it has the little handle on the
side wanted to mimic that some so uh

376
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:56,920
side wanted to mimic that some so uh
 

377
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,630
side wanted to mimic that some so uh
this is like a door hinge piece that I

378
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
this is like a door hinge piece that I
 

379
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,430
this is like a door hinge piece that I
had a bunch of in Brown cuz they used it

380
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,440
had a bunch of in Brown cuz they used it
 

381
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,230
had a bunch of in Brown cuz they used it
as a tree piece back in the old uh River

382
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:05,240
as a tree piece back in the old uh River
 

383
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,870
as a tree piece back in the old uh River
Retreat set and then you know we've got

384
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:07,880
Retreat set and then you know we've got
 

385
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,509
Retreat set and then you know we've got
an arch on a front and a door window

386
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:10,519
an arch on a front and a door window
 

387
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,870
an arch on a front and a door window
here and then the rest is just some some

388
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:13,880
here and then the rest is just some some
 

389
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,790
here and then the rest is just some some
basic bricks and again using grill

390
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:15,800
basic bricks and again using grill
 

391
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,949
basic bricks and again using grill
plates on the top because the studs just

392
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
plates on the top because the studs just
 

393
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,870
plates on the top because the studs just
didn't work with this

394
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
didn't work with this
 

395
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,110
didn't work with this
one um we'll leave that one for now this

396
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
one um we'll leave that one for now this
 

397
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,110
one um we'll leave that one for now this
one um so I made this to go on the

398
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,120
one um so I made this to go on the
 

399
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,710
one um so I made this to go on the
street next to the uh micro green

400
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
street next to the uh micro green
 

401
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,790
street next to the uh micro green
grosser and the micro scale movie

402
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
grosser and the micro scale movie
 

403
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,750
grosser and the micro scale movie
theater so it's supposed to sort of be a

404
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:34,760
theater so it's supposed to sort of be a
 

405
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,550
theater so it's supposed to sort of be a
building at that scale which is slightly

406
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
building at that scale which is slightly
 

407
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,910
building at that scale which is slightly
different some of some of these others

408
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:38,920
different some of some of these others
 

409
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,550
different some of some of these others
and I had that uh 1 by two brick with

410
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:41,560
and I had that uh 1 by two brick with
 

411
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,190
and I had that uh 1 by two brick with
the ice cream on it so I thought this is

412
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
the ice cream on it so I thought this is
 

413
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,710
the ice cream on it so I thought this is
sort of like an ice cream parlor and I

414
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:45,720
sort of like an ice cream parlor and I
 

415
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,430
sort of like an ice cream parlor and I
wanted to use the dark red that's in the

416
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
wanted to use the dark red that's in the
 

417
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,750
wanted to use the dark red that's in the
ice cream so I just got out all my dark

418
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
ice cream so I just got out all my dark
 

419
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,630
ice cream so I just got out all my dark
red pieces and put together this roof so

420
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:53,640
red pieces and put together this roof so
 

421
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,949
red pieces and put together this roof so
you know these are Technic axle bricks

422
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:55,959
you know these are Technic axle bricks
 

423
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,750
you know these are Technic axle bricks
some roof

424
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
some roof
 

425
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,470
some roof
pieces uh some of those curvy

426
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:01,480
pieces uh some of those curvy
 

427
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,389
pieces uh some of those curvy
slopes this plate is a a weird curvy

428
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:05,399
slopes this plate is a a weird curvy
 

429
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,030
slopes this plate is a a weird curvy
plate but I like the way it uh curves it

430
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,040
plate but I like the way it uh curves it
 

431
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,590
plate but I like the way it uh curves it
down and then these are some regular

432
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
down and then these are some regular
 

433
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,350
down and then these are some regular
slopes here so again you can see that uh

434
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
slopes here so again you can see that uh
 

435
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,790
slopes here so again you can see that uh
just sort of fit that all onto some

436
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:15,800
just sort of fit that all onto some
 

437
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,470
just sort of fit that all onto some
white plates and then uh or white

438
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:19,480
white plates and then uh or white
 

439
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,790
white plates and then uh or white
bricks and uh got some columns down here

440
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
bricks and uh got some columns down here
 

441
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,710
bricks and uh got some columns down here
but again the bottom just some arches

442
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:25,720
but again the bottom just some arches
 

443
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,590
but again the bottom just some arches
and some basic

444
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
and some basic
 

445
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,790
and some basic
bricks so yeah

446
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
bricks so yeah
 

447
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,629
bricks so yeah
that's that

448
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:35,639

 

449
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,710

one uh this yellow building uh is

450
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:39,720
one uh this yellow building uh is
 

451
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,110
one uh this yellow building uh is
actually built you know to stand up not

452
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
actually built you know to stand up not
 

453
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,670
actually built you know to stand up not
the way studs are so uh I had some of

454
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:46,680
the way studs are so uh I had some of
 

455
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,389
the way studs are so uh I had some of
the this piece and thought they would

456
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:49,399
the this piece and thought they would
 

457
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,269
the this piece and thought they would
make a cool front of a building and I

458
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
make a cool front of a building and I
 

459
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,990
make a cool front of a building and I
had this weird these weird pieces I

460
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
had this weird these weird pieces I
 

461
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,870
had this weird these weird pieces I
don't know it's a weird curvy slope and

462
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:57,880
don't know it's a weird curvy slope and
 

463
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,470
don't know it's a weird curvy slope and
again that 2 by two

464
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
again that 2 by two
 

465
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,310
again that 2 by two
plate that sort of Curves

466
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
plate that sort of Curves
 

467
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,870
plate that sort of Curves
down uh I just thought that gave it a

468
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
down uh I just thought that gave it a
 

469
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,430
down uh I just thought that gave it a
nice little top and just put a little 1X

470
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:08,440
nice little top and just put a little 1X
 

471
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,310
nice little top and just put a little 1X
two plate there and I just built a whole

472
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,320
two plate there and I just built a whole
 

473
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,430
two plate there and I just built a whole
bunch of plates to run along and uh fill

474
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:14,440
bunch of plates to run along and uh fill
 

475
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,829
bunch of plates to run along and uh fill
out the bottom and then uh put it all

476
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:16,839
out the bottom and then uh put it all
 

477
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,910
out the bottom and then uh put it all
back together and stands up has a sort

478
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
back together and stands up has a sort
 

479
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,670
back together and stands up has a sort
of nice

480
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680

 

481
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,590

silhouette uh this eye building uh I had

482
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:26,600
silhouette uh this eye building uh I had
 

483
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,710
silhouette uh this eye building uh I had
a whole I have a whole bunch of this IP

484
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:29,720
a whole I have a whole bunch of this IP
 

485
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,670
a whole I have a whole bunch of this IP
from uh pick a brick and I thought it

486
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:32,680
from uh pick a brick and I thought it
 

487
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,670
from uh pick a brick and I thought it
would make a cool little building here

488
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:34,680
would make a cool little building here
 

489
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,670
would make a cool little building here
so uh again based on the eyepiece I just

490
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:38,680
so uh again based on the eyepiece I just
 

491
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,190
so uh again based on the eyepiece I just
pulled the color scheme from the rest of

492
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,200
pulled the color scheme from the rest of
 

493
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,030
pulled the color scheme from the rest of
the building uh for that so got one by

494
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,040
the building uh for that so got one by
 

495
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,829
the building uh for that so got one by
one

496
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
one
 

497
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,949
one
uh cylinder bricks in white and a bunch

498
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
uh cylinder bricks in white and a bunch
 

499
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,350
uh cylinder bricks in white and a bunch
of 4x4 plates in black and just built a

500
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
of 4x4 plates in black and just built a
 

501
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,110
of 4x4 plates in black and just built a
whole bunch of levels of that and then

502
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
whole bunch of levels of that and then
 

503
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,829
whole bunch of levels of that and then
it's uh again when you put it in the

504
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
it's uh again when you put it in the
 

505
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,230
it's uh again when you put it in the
background it doesn't look

506
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
background it doesn't look
 

507
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,430
background it doesn't look
as weird as when it's all by itself but

508
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
as weird as when it's all by itself but
 

509
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,629
as weird as when it's all by itself but
uh you know sort of interesting

510
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:07,639

 

511
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:11,230

building um these two are both built on

512
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,240
building um these two are both built on
 

513
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,870
building um these two are both built on
the same principle of uh these uh half

514
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:15,880
the same principle of uh these uh half
 

515
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,750
the same principle of uh these uh half
octagon plates so I have a whole bunch

516
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:18,760
octagon plates so I have a whole bunch
 

517
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,350
octagon plates so I have a whole bunch
of those in green and uh I had some in

518
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,360
of those in green and uh I had some in
 

519
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,189
of those in green and uh I had some in
transparent red so I wanted to

520
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:25,199
transparent red so I wanted to
 

521
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,629
transparent red so I wanted to
capitalize on that so for the Green

522
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:27,639
capitalize on that so for the Green
 

523
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,629
capitalize on that so for the Green
Building just pull part of level here

524
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
Building just pull part of level here
 

525
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,030
Building just pull part of level here
you can see that uh these are just again

526
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,040
you can see that uh these are just again
 

527
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,389
you can see that uh these are just again
a whole bunch of probably pick a brick

528
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
a whole bunch of probably pick a brick
 

529
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,430
a whole bunch of probably pick a brick
uh one by one transparent yellow

530
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:40,440
uh one by one transparent yellow
 

531
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,110
uh one by one transparent yellow
pieces uh stacked up and then I have a

532
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
pieces uh stacked up and then I have a
 

533
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,310
pieces uh stacked up and then I have a
2X two and a

534
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,320
2X two and a
 

535
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,030
2X two and a
1x4 freaking green so that the windows

536
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,040
1x4 freaking green so that the windows
 

537
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,750
1x4 freaking green so that the windows
are just along the sides here and then

538
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:50,760
are just along the sides here and then
 

539
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,910
are just along the sides here and then
uh a whole bunch of those plates and

540
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:52,920
uh a whole bunch of those plates and
 

541
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,110
uh a whole bunch of those plates and
then again just stacking up a bunch of

542
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
then again just stacking up a bunch of
 

543
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,710
then again just stacking up a bunch of
levels of

544
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
levels of
 

545
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,470
levels of
that uh and this works on the same

546
00:12:59,470 --> 00:12:59,480
that uh and this works on the same
 

547
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,829
that uh and this works on the same
principle except I had enough

548
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:00,839
principle except I had enough
 

549
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,150
principle except I had enough
transparent red that uh I didn't have

550
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
transparent red that uh I didn't have
 

551
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,269
transparent red that uh I didn't have
any one by one bricks that were Square

552
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
any one by one bricks that were Square
 

553
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,069
any one by one bricks that were Square
so I have the column cylinder ones along

554
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
so I have the column cylinder ones along
 

555
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,470
so I have the column cylinder ones along
the edges and uh having the uh plate and

556
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
the edges and uh having the uh plate and
 

557
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,470
the edges and uh having the uh plate and
trans red and then uh some trans red

558
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:17,480
trans red and then uh some trans red
 

559
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,550
trans red and then uh some trans red
bricks in the middle and then this was

560
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
bricks in the middle and then this was
 

561
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,350
bricks in the middle and then this was
as tall as this building could be

562
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
as tall as this building could be
 

563
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,949
as tall as this building could be
obviously not quite as tall as this but

564
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:23,959
obviously not quite as tall as this but
 

565
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,670
obviously not quite as tall as this but
they uh you know work

566
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:26,680
they uh you know work
 

567
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,629
they uh you know work
well this uh gold building

568
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:29,639
well this uh gold building
 

569
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,350
well this uh gold building
I had a whole bunch of these gold 2x4s

570
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,360
I had a whole bunch of these gold 2x4s
 

571
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,310
I had a whole bunch of these gold 2x4s
from the uh 50th

572
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
from the uh 50th
 

573
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,110
from the uh 50th
anniversaries and then um you can see

574
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
anniversaries and then um you can see
 

575
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,310
anniversaries and then um you can see
actually that there's two different

576
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
actually that there's two different
 

577
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,670
actually that there's two different
shades of gold here but

578
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:40,680
shades of gold here but
 

579
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,310
shades of gold here but
um if we look at this level uh I also

580
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
um if we look at this level uh I also
 

581
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,750
um if we look at this level uh I also
had a couple 2x2s I think those all came

582
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
had a couple 2x2s I think those all came
 

583
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,990
had a couple 2x2s I think those all came
together so this is a 2X two 2x two 2x4

584
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
together so this is a 2X two 2x two 2x4
 

585
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,230
together so this is a 2X two 2x two 2x4
and then the top is some more 2x4s and

586
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
and then the top is some more 2x4s and
 

587
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,870
and then the top is some more 2x4s and
then uh you know I just rummaged through

588
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
then uh you know I just rummaged through
 

589
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,310
then uh you know I just rummaged through
all my gold pieces and had a whole bunch

590
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,320
all my gold pieces and had a whole bunch
 

591
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,749
all my gold pieces and had a whole bunch
of uh this slope topper and again this

592
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:03,759
of uh this slope topper and again this
 

593
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,710
of uh this slope topper and again this
weird curvy brick which I believe is

594
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:05,720
weird curvy brick which I believe is
 

595
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,310
weird curvy brick which I believe is
from the Indiana Jones uh Arc of the

596
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
from the Indiana Jones uh Arc of the
 

597
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,389
from the Indiana Jones uh Arc of the
Covenant piece so uh and then some gold

598
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
Covenant piece so uh and then some gold
 

599
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,189
Covenant piece so uh and then some gold
jumper plates with gold studs and just

600
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
jumper plates with gold studs and just
 

601
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,749
jumper plates with gold studs and just
sort of filled it out to uh look nice so

602
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:21,759
sort of filled it out to uh look nice so
 

603
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,470
sort of filled it out to uh look nice so
yeah and I really want to build this at

604
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
yeah and I really want to build this at
 

605
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,550
yeah and I really want to build this at
a larger scale but I don't have the gold

606
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
a larger scale but I don't have the gold
 

607
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,550
a larger scale but I don't have the gold
pieces for that so I'll just have to

608
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
pieces for that so I'll just have to
 

609
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,030
pieces for that so I'll just have to
stay at this SC for

610
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,040
stay at this SC for
 

611
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,189
stay at this SC for
now uh this Orange Building is really

612
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
now uh this Orange Building is really
 

613
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,629
now uh this Orange Building is really
weird doesn't really look like a

614
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
weird doesn't really look like a
 

615
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,389
weird doesn't really look like a
building but again I just had these

616
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
building but again I just had these
 

617
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,430
building but again I just had these
weird orange pieces and wanted to figure

618
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:38,440
weird orange pieces and wanted to figure
 

619
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,910
weird orange pieces and wanted to figure
out how to use them so I'll take this

620
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:40,920
out how to use them so I'll take this
 

621
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,110
out how to use them so I'll take this
one apart

622
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,120
one apart
 

623
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,389
one apart
actually so uh down

624
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:45,399
actually so uh down
 

625
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,350
actually so uh down
here we've got these

626
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
here we've got these
 

627
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,990
here we've got these
uh again I think these are exoforce

628
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
uh again I think these are exoforce
 

629
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,350
uh again I think these are exoforce
pieces maybe sort of a curvy down slope

630
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,360
pieces maybe sort of a curvy down slope
 

631
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,629
pieces maybe sort of a curvy down slope
got four of those with uh this curvy

632
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
got four of those with uh this curvy
 

633
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,790
got four of those with uh this curvy
brick

634
00:14:59,790 --> 00:14:59,800
brick
 

635
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,189
brick
they're all sitting on um some

636
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199

 

637
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,189

plates so basically there's two 2x4

638
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:08,199
plates so basically there's two 2x4
 

639
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,030
plates so basically there's two 2x4
plates with a 2x6 plate 2x two plates so

640
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,040
plates with a 2x6 plate 2x two plates so
 

641
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,749
plates with a 2x6 plate 2x two plates so
those are all sitting on top of that and

642
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:14,759
those are all sitting on top of that and
 

643
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,550
those are all sitting on top of that and
then at the bottom here we're just

644
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:17,560
then at the bottom here we're just
 

645
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,030
then at the bottom here we're just
filling it out with uh these

646
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,040

 

647
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,550

uh bricks that go out and then

648
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:25,560
uh bricks that go out and then
 

649
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,110
uh bricks that go out and then
uh one by two bricks then uh

650
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,120
uh one by two bricks then uh
 

651
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,790
uh one by two bricks then uh
the whole kitten Kaboodle how does this

652
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
the whole kitten Kaboodle how does this
 

653
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,910
the whole kitten Kaboodle how does this
go hold on one second that goes like

654
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:34,920
go hold on one second that goes like
 

655
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,430
go hold on one second that goes like
that right so then

656
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
that right so then
 

657
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,710
that right so then
um this is a 2x4 brick and a 1x6 these

658
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:41,720
um this is a 2x4 brick and a 1x6 these
 

659
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,110
um this is a 2x4 brick and a 1x6 these
pieces do not actually connect this way

660
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,120
pieces do not actually connect this way
 

661
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,269
pieces do not actually connect this way
so this will just sort of slide together

662
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:46,279
so this will just sort of slide together
 

663
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,710
so this will just sort of slide together
and be held on like that in a second and

664
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
and be held on like that in a second and
 

665
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,749
and be held on like that in a second and
so then this contraption over here you

666
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:54,759
so then this contraption over here you
 

667
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,230
so then this contraption over here you
can see it's a 2x6 plate and then I got

668
00:15:59,230 --> 00:15:59,240
can see it's a 2x6 plate and then I got
 

669
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,230
can see it's a 2x6 plate and then I got
some Technic bricks here so some orange

670
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
some Technic bricks here so some orange
 

671
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,870
some Technic bricks here so some orange
with a hole in the Middle where I've put

672
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:03,880
with a hole in the Middle where I've put
 

673
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,430
with a hole in the Middle where I've put
in uh again our favorite little half

674
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:06,440
in uh again our favorite little half
 

675
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,110
in uh again our favorite little half
stud piece two of those sticking out and

676
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
stud piece two of those sticking out and
 

677
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,430
stud piece two of those sticking out and
this one's got the two holes in a 1 by

678
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:12,440
this one's got the two holes in a 1 by
 

679
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,269
this one's got the two holes in a 1 by
two

680
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
two
 

681
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,829
two
brick um and then 1x4 up there and then

682
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
brick um and then 1x4 up there and then
 

683
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,230
brick um and then 1x4 up there and then
uh this is some upside down slope pieces

684
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,240
uh this is some upside down slope pieces
 

685
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,430
uh this is some upside down slope pieces
that again might be from the SpongeBob

686
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
that again might be from the SpongeBob
 

687
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,710
that again might be from the SpongeBob
set or the recycling truck from town and

688
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:27,720
set or the recycling truck from town and
 

689
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,749
set or the recycling truck from town and
uh put a 1x4 tile on that and that's

690
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:30,759
uh put a 1x4 tile on that and that's
 

691
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,590
uh put a 1x4 tile on that and that's
what's going to slide into that space

692
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:32,600
what's going to slide into that space
 

693
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,069
what's going to slide into that space
down

694
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
down
 

695
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,230
down
there and if we top this off with 2x6

696
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
there and if we top this off with 2x6
 

697
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,790
there and if we top this off with 2x6
plate we got this uh piece to connect

698
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:41,800
plate we got this uh piece to connect
 

699
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,350
plate we got this uh piece to connect
these two together so they actually fit

700
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,360
these two together so they actually fit
 

701
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,150
these two together so they actually fit
together I like the way that the um you

702
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,160
together I like the way that the um you
 

703
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,189
together I like the way that the um you
know I built this so that the lines of

704
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
know I built this so that the lines of
 

705
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,990
know I built this so that the lines of
the weird pieces on the front would be

706
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,000
the weird pieces on the front would be
 

707
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,629
the weird pieces on the front would be
matched by the middle

708
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
matched by the middle
 

709
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,309
matched by the middle
stuff um so even though this is a crazy

710
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:55,319
stuff um so even though this is a crazy
 

711
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:57,870
stuff um so even though this is a crazy
looking building it still sort of has

712
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:57,880
looking building it still sort of has
 

713
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,670
looking building it still sort of has
nice looking lines

714
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
nice looking lines
 

715
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,629
nice looking lines
and again these slope pieces we're going

716
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:01,639
and again these slope pieces we're going
 

717
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,590
and again these slope pieces we're going
to put on so the hole right here fits on

718
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:04,600
to put on so the hole right here fits on
 

719
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,630
to put on so the hole right here fits on
the half pin and then on the top we've

720
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
the half pin and then on the top we've
 

721
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,750
the half pin and then on the top we've
got these uh little plates with wings

722
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
got these uh little plates with wings
 

723
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,390
got these uh little plates with wings
some more curvy

724
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
some more curvy
 

725
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,990
some more curvy
pieces and uh two of those and uh sort

726
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
pieces and uh two of those and uh sort
 

727
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,949
pieces and uh two of those and uh sort
of looks like a little person I actually

728
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
of looks like a little person I actually
 

729
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,270
of looks like a little person I actually
uh plan to during the Orange versus

730
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,280
uh plan to during the Orange versus
 

731
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,150
uh plan to during the Orange versus
green War have these two buildings fight

732
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
green War have these two buildings fight
 

733
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,270
green War have these two buildings fight
each other uh this one sort of looks

734
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,280
each other uh this one sort of looks
 

735
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,390
each other uh this one sort of looks
like a samur

736
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,400
like a samur
 

737
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,750
like a samur
guy and this one sort of looks like I

738
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:32,760
guy and this one sort of looks like I
 

739
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,990
guy and this one sort of looks like I
don't know someone with big ears maybe

740
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
don't know someone with big ears maybe
 

741
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,230
don't know someone with big ears maybe
but uh this Samurai

742
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
but uh this Samurai
 

743
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,549
but uh this Samurai
building also is a a strange little one

744
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
building also is a a strange little one
 

745
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,270
building also is a a strange little one
so let me take this apart so this one is

746
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
so let me take this apart so this one is
 

747
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,710
so let me take this apart so this one is
held together almost entirely by these

748
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:47,720
held together almost entirely by these
 

749
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,630
held together almost entirely by these
uh camera bricks right here so

750
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:53,640

 

751
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,510

uh basically just stacked three of those

752
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
uh basically just stacked three of those
 

753
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,510
uh basically just stacked three of those
together and then

754
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
together and then
 

755
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,390
together and then
uh this partial Travis brick down at the

756
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
uh this partial Travis brick down at the
 

757
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,350
uh this partial Travis brick down at the
bottom and then this is a uh

758
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:06,360
bottom and then this is a uh
 

759
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,590
bottom and then this is a uh
1x10 plate and then I've got some these

760
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:10,600
1x10 plate and then I've got some these
 

761
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,470
1x10 plate and then I've got some these
1 by two cheese grater pieces some more

762
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:13,480
1 by two cheese grater pieces some more
 

763
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,510
1 by two cheese grater pieces some more
plates in a brick so I made two of

764
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
plates in a brick so I made two of
 

765
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,310
plates in a brick so I made two of
these and these are the side of the

766
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
these and these are the side of the
 

767
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,950
these and these are the side of the
building and they

768
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960
building and they
 

769
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,350
building and they
uh line

770
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360

 

771
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,710

up uh pretty pretty

772
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:29,720
up uh pretty pretty
 

773
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,950
up uh pretty pretty
good into

774
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:33,960

 

775
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,310

here not exactly connected but so you

776
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
here not exactly connected but so you
 

777
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,990
here not exactly connected but so you
have to pull them apart a little

778
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,000
have to pull them apart a little
 

779
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,990
have to pull them apart a little
bit and then

780
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
bit and then
 

781
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,350
bit and then
uh put those there so that gives you a

782
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,360
uh put those there so that gives you a
 

783
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,590
uh put those there so that gives you a
nice solid base to work

784
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:46,600
nice solid base to work
 

785
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,549
nice solid base to work
on and then the front pieces so well at

786
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:49,559
on and then the front pieces so well at
 

787
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,230
on and then the front pieces so well at
the top these are the curvy Arch some

788
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
the top these are the curvy Arch some
 

789
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,870
the top these are the curvy Arch some
chees slopes a 1x two plate so that gets

790
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
chees slopes a 1x two plate so that gets
 

791
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,350
chees slopes a 1x two plate so that gets
to be our little Samurai

792
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
to be our little Samurai
 

793
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,350
to be our little Samurai
head then in front uh we're doing this

794
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
head then in front uh we're doing this
 

795
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,990
head then in front uh we're doing this
weird I guess it's for car

796
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
weird I guess it's for car
 

797
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,710
weird I guess it's for car
bumpers um and then uh 1X two plate so

798
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
bumpers um and then uh 1X two plate so
 

799
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,549
bumpers um and then uh 1X two plate so
that goes right there so then um this

800
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
that goes right there so then um this
 

801
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,669
that goes right there so then um this
piece has got two 2x3 plates a whole

802
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:16,679
piece has got two 2x3 plates a whole
 

803
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,549
piece has got two 2x3 plates a whole
bunch of these cheese grater plates or

804
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:19,559
bunch of these cheese grater plates or
 

805
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,270
bunch of these cheese grater plates or
slopes cuz I had a whole bunch of them

806
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
slopes cuz I had a whole bunch of them
 

807
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,950
slopes cuz I had a whole bunch of them
and this building was a way to use them

808
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
and this building was a way to use them
 

809
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,990
and this building was a way to use them
up uh 1x4 tile down the center this is

810
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
up uh 1x4 tile down the center this is
 

811
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,710
up uh 1x4 tile down the center this is
going to go on this top camera brick

812
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
going to go on this top camera brick
 

813
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,950
going to go on this top camera brick
this is just a little piece with some

814
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:29,960
this is just a little piece with some
 

815
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,870
this is just a little piece with some
cheese slopes on a plate that goes right

816
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
cheese slopes on a plate that goes right
 

817
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,789
cheese slopes on a plate that goes right
there this bottom one is a uh 1x4

818
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:37,799
there this bottom one is a uh 1x4
 

819
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,590
there this bottom one is a uh 1x4
2x4 uh and then I got this curvy slope

820
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:40,600
2x4 uh and then I got this curvy slope
 

821
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,630
2x4 uh and then I got this curvy slope
piece with a plate on the bottom more

822
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
piece with a plate on the bottom more
 

823
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,270
piece with a plate on the bottom more
cheese graters more cheese

824
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
cheese graters more cheese
 

825
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,110
cheese graters more cheese
slopes and then this fits right across

826
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,120
slopes and then this fits right across
 

827
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,750
slopes and then this fits right across
the bottom and then um you know you've

828
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:50,760
the bottom and then um you know you've
 

829
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,669
the bottom and then um you know you've
got this nice stud connection on the

830
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:52,679
got this nice stud connection on the
 

831
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,110
got this nice stud connection on the
bottom so you can actually connect it to

832
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,120
bottom so you can actually connect it to
 

833
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,750
bottom so you can actually connect it to
something so this is just a 2x6 plate so

834
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
something so this is just a 2x6 plate so
 

835
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,950
something so this is just a 2x6 plate so
that it has a little more stability

836
00:19:59,950 --> 00:19:59,960
that it has a little more stability
 

837
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,110
that it has a little more stability
obviously 2x7 would be perfect but they

838
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,120
obviously 2x7 would be perfect but they
 

839
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,070
obviously 2x7 would be perfect but they
don't make that size so uh that's that

840
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
don't make that size so uh that's that
 

841
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,470
don't make that size so uh that's that
building then uh this big gray

842
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:09,480
building then uh this big gray
 

843
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,750

one
um so uh it's only two studs thick but

846
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
um so uh it's only two studs thick but
 

847
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,830
um so uh it's only two studs thick but
uh got an arch piece here some big slope

848
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:20,840
uh got an arch piece here some big slope
 

849
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,549

ears so
 

869
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,430
ears so
uh on top of all that there's a 2x6

870
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:54,440
uh on top of all that there's a 2x6
 

871

plate with some cheese

874
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
plate with some cheese
 

875
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,230
plate with some cheese
slopes uh again plate with cheese slopes

876
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,240
slopes uh again plate with cheese slopes
 

877
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,549
slopes uh again plate with cheese slopes
there then this big piece which is

878
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
there then this big piece which is
 

879
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,950
there then this big piece which is
sometimes used in

880
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:07,960
sometimes used in
 

881
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,750
sometimes used in
vehicles um just put in a 1 by two tile

882
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:12,760
vehicles um just put in a 1 by two tile
 

883
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,269
vehicles um just put in a 1 by two tile
there fits very nicely over this big

884
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:16,279
there fits very nicely over this big
 

885
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,830
there fits very nicely over this big
Contraption and gives some nice top and

886
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:18,840
Contraption and gives some nice top and
 

887
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,870
Contraption and gives some nice top and
then uh again this weird 2 by two slope

888
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:21,880
then uh again this weird 2 by two slope
 

889
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,390
then uh again this weird 2 by two slope
piece I like that little face there not

890
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
piece I like that little face there not
 

891
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,190
piece I like that little face there not
that you see that uh so that's that

892
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
that you see that uh so that's that
 

893
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,470
that you see that uh so that's that
building then the last three that I'm

894
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:29,480
building then the last three that I'm
 

895
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,630
building then the last three that I'm
going to

896
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
going to
 

897
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,269
going to
do um also exist as larger versions but

898
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:36,279
do um also exist as larger versions but
 

899
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,470
do um also exist as larger versions but
uh I think the way most of these was

900
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
uh I think the way most of these was
 

901
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,549
uh I think the way most of these was
created that I built the large building

902
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
created that I built the large building
 

903
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,549
created that I built the large building
first and then I just shrunk it down to

904
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
first and then I just shrunk it down to
 

905
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,269
first and then I just shrunk it down to
make the small building so this is the

906
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:44,279
make the small building so this is the
 

907
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,190
make the small building so this is the
blue Bank building it's got a big b on

908
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200
blue Bank building it's got a big b on
 

909
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,390
blue Bank building it's got a big b on
the front so each of these is a technic

910
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
the front so each of these is a technic
 

911
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,590
the front so each of these is a technic
brick that I've just uh put a

912
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:52,600
brick that I've just uh put a
 

913
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,110
brick that I've just uh put a
transparent brick into plate rather so

914
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,120
transparent brick into plate rather so
 

915
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,190
transparent brick into plate rather so
this is a 1x4 Technic brick these are

916
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,200
this is a 1x4 Technic brick these are
 

917
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,350
this is a 1x4 Technic brick these are
two 1X tws a 1x4 2 1X tws 1x4 and then I

918
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
two 1X tws a 1x4 2 1X tws 1x4 and then I
 

919
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,870
two 1X tws a 1x4 2 1X tws 1x4 and then I
just made these three blue and the rest

920
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:05,880
just made these three blue and the rest
 

921
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,870
just made these three blue and the rest
yellow and then you get the little be

922
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:07,880
yellow and then you get the little be
 

923
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,990
yellow and then you get the little be
there um so that's the whole front and

924
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,000
there um so that's the whole front and
 

925
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,630
there um so that's the whole front and
then an arch and some bricks and a

926
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:13,640
then an arch and some bricks and a
 

927
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,669
then an arch and some bricks and a
little plate bottom the whole back is

928
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
little plate bottom the whole back is
 

929
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,710
little plate bottom the whole back is
just standard brick and uh we've got

930
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
just standard brick and uh we've got
 

931
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,590
just standard brick and uh we've got
these curvy arches at the

932
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:20,600
these curvy arches at the
 

933
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,909
these curvy arches at the
top so it's a 2 x two brick the curvy

934
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:24,919
top so it's a 2 x two brick the curvy
 

935
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,669
top so it's a 2 x two brick the curvy
arches some 1 by two plates and a 2 by

936
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
arches some 1 by two plates and a 2 by
 

937
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,230
arches some 1 by two plates and a 2 by
two tile the very top so that's the blue

938
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
two tile the very top so that's the blue
 

939
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,510
two tile the very top so that's the blue
Bank building then you get this hotel

940
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
Bank building then you get this hotel
 

941
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,870
Bank building then you get this hotel
Pink hotel which sort of looks like

942
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:35,880
Pink hotel which sort of looks like
 

943
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,350
Pink hotel which sort of looks like
Pepto Bisal um bottle um so this used up

944
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
Pepto Bisal um bottle um so this used up
 

945
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,909
Pepto Bisal um bottle um so this used up
a lot of my clear pieces so the interior

946
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
a lot of my clear pieces so the interior
 

947
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,430
a lot of my clear pieces so the interior
here is basically all um 1X two clear

948
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
here is basically all um 1X two clear
 

949
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,470
here is basically all um 1X two clear
plates stacked on top of each other so

950
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
plates stacked on top of each other so
 

951
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,269
plates stacked on top of each other so
sometimes they go back and sometimes

952
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:56,279
sometimes they go back and sometimes
 

953
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,909
sometimes they go back and sometimes
they go across and they alternate a

954
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
they go across and they alternate a
 

955
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,710
they go across and they alternate a
little bit to get it some

956
00:22:59,710 --> 00:22:59,720
little bit to get it some
 

957
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,710
little bit to get it some
stability um and

958
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
stability um and
 

959
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,750
stability um and
then I had a mixture of uh so basically

960
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
then I had a mixture of uh so basically
 

961
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,630
then I had a mixture of uh so basically
in the back you'll see the the pink juts

962
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:11,640
in the back you'll see the the pink juts
 

963
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,149
in the back you'll see the the pink juts
in that's because otherwise this pink

964
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
in that's because otherwise this pink
 

965
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,870
in that's because otherwise this pink
side piece would not be connected to the

966
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:15,880
side piece would not be connected to the
 

967
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,870
side piece would not be connected to the
rest of the building unless you did some

968
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:17,880
rest of the building unless you did some
 

969
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,230
rest of the building unless you did some
slope on the bottom so I had a 2X two

970
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
slope on the bottom so I had a 2X two
 

971
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,909
slope on the bottom so I had a 2X two
pink piece here this is mostly 1X one um

972
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:24,919
pink piece here this is mostly 1X one um
 

973
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:26,430
pink piece here this is mostly 1X one um
pieces except for the bottom which is a

974
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:26,440
pieces except for the bottom which is a
 

975
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,149
pieces except for the bottom which is a
1x two there's a 1x two that sticks in

976
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
1x two there's a 1x two that sticks in
 

977
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,750
1x two there's a 1x two that sticks in
that's the same on both sides and then

978
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:32,760
that's the same on both sides and then
 

979
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,390
that's the same on both sides and then
this up here is all one by one pink

980
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
this up here is all one by one pink
 

981
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,390
this up here is all one by one pink
pieces and it's held together by these

982
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:39,400
pieces and it's held together by these
 

983
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,630
pieces and it's held together by these
uh 2x two uh downward slope transparent

984
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
uh 2x two uh downward slope transparent
 

985
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,110
uh 2x two uh downward slope transparent
pieces the center is a mixture of bricks

986
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120
pieces the center is a mixture of bricks
 

987
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,590
pieces the center is a mixture of bricks
and plates that are

988
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:48,600
and plates that are
 

989
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,710
and plates that are
transparent and at the very top I've got

990
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:51,720
transparent and at the very top I've got
 

991
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,029
transparent and at the very top I've got
two 1ex one round plates that I'm

992
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
two 1ex one round plates that I'm
 

993
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,669
two 1ex one round plates that I'm
sticking right in the middle there not

994
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
sticking right in the middle there not
 

995
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,269
sticking right in the middle there not
the sturdiest con connection but it

996
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279
the sturdiest con connection but it
 

997
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,070
the sturdiest con connection but it
looks good and then this uh I think this

998
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,080
looks good and then this uh I think this
 

999
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,590
looks good and then this uh I think this
is more of a residential building

1000
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:04,600
is more of a residential building
 

1001
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,950
is more of a residential building
probably an apartment

1002
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:05,960
probably an apartment
 

1003
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,149
probably an apartment
building this one I built the small

1004
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
building this one I built the small
 

1005
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,990
building this one I built the small
version first and then built the big

1006
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
version first and then built the big
 

1007
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,110
version first and then built the big
version

1008
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,120
version
 

1009
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,070
version
afterwards um but uh again these are I

1010
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,080
afterwards um but uh again these are I
 

1011
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,190
afterwards um but uh again these are I
got a whole pick a brick full of these 1

1012
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
got a whole pick a brick full of these 1
 

1013
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,149
got a whole pick a brick full of these 1
by two clear plates which is why I have

1014
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:21,159
by two clear plates which is why I have
 

1015
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,750
by two clear plates which is why I have
them in so many buildings but uh we just

1016
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
them in so many buildings but uh we just
 

1017
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,389
them in so many buildings but uh we just
got 2x3 plates and then these plates

1018
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:27,399
got 2x3 plates and then these plates
 

1019
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,710
got 2x3 plates and then these plates
which have the lines going either way I

1020
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:29,720
which have the lines going either way I
 

1021
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,350
which have the lines going either way I
chose to have them all

1022
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:32,360
chose to have them all
 

1023
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,990
chose to have them all
horizontal

1024
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,000
horizontal
 

1025
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,230
horizontal
um and then at the top here you've got

1026
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,240
um and then at the top here you've got
 

1027
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,750
um and then at the top here you've got
this handle piece and uh tile on the top

1028
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
this handle piece and uh tile on the top
 

1029
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,110
this handle piece and uh tile on the top
and then just a little 1 by two plate at

1030
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,120
and then just a little 1 by two plate at
 

1031
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,350
and then just a little 1 by two plate at
the bottom so you know there's like a

1032
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:46,360
the bottom so you know there's like a
 

1033
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,830
the bottom so you know there's like a
little doorway down there so those three

1034
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:48,840
little doorway down there so those three
 

1035
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,669
little doorway down there so those three
buildings hold on so I've also built

1036
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
buildings hold on so I've also built
 

1037
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,510
buildings hold on so I've also built
larger versions of these three buildings

1038
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:54,520
larger versions of these three buildings
 

1039
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,269
larger versions of these three buildings
as I said before

1040
00:24:59,269 --> 00:24:59,279

 

1041
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,750

I can get them in the

1042
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:00,760
I can get them in the
 

1043
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,149
I can get them in the
shot so uh this red one is the most

1044
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
shot so uh this red one is the most
 

1045
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,389
shot so uh this red one is the most
recent and I don't think it's actually

1046
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:05,399
recent and I don't think it's actually
 

1047
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:07,950
recent and I don't think it's actually
showed up in an animation but basically

1048
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:07,960
showed up in an animation but basically
 

1049
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,230
showed up in an animation but basically
to mimic the lines on the side of the

1050
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
to mimic the lines on the side of the
 

1051
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,510
to mimic the lines on the side of the
building I

1052
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
building I
 

1053
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,389
building I
uh just took uh these are just you know

1054
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:17,399
uh just took uh these are just you know
 

1055
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,990
uh just took uh these are just you know
some clear bricks and then the rest of

1056
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
some clear bricks and then the rest of
 

1057
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,510
some clear bricks and then the rest of
it is basically red plates and here's an

1058
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:22,520
it is basically red plates and here's an
 

1059
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,310
it is basically red plates and here's an
arch to mimic the little hole at the

1060
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,320
arch to mimic the little hole at the
 

1061
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,029
arch to mimic the little hole at the
bottom but this is just layers of plates

1062
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:28,039
bottom but this is just layers of plates
 

1063
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,029
bottom but this is just layers of plates
stick sticking out alternating

1064
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:30,039
stick sticking out alternating
 

1065
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,510
stick sticking out alternating
throughout and uh at the top using some

1066
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
throughout and uh at the top using some
 

1067
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,830
throughout and uh at the top using some
big slopes to mimic that so um again

1068
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:36,840
big slopes to mimic that so um again
 

1069
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,710
big slopes to mimic that so um again
there's not much to this building it's

1070
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
there's not much to this building it's
 

1071
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,789
there's not much to this building it's
just basically layers of of patterns and

1072
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:41,799
just basically layers of of patterns and
 

1073
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,149
just basically layers of of patterns and
that's what a lot of buildings in real

1074
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
that's what a lot of buildings in real
 

1075
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,310
that's what a lot of buildings in real
life look like so you know I don't mind

1076
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,320
life look like so you know I don't mind
 

1077
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,669
life look like so you know I don't mind
doing that here uh this building I I

1078
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:50,679
doing that here uh this building I I
 

1079
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,990
doing that here uh this building I I
have gray pieces in here cuz I just

1080
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,000
have gray pieces in here cuz I just
 

1081
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,430
have gray pieces in here cuz I just
don't have big pink plates but all the

1082
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
don't have big pink plates but all the
 

1083
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,110
don't have big pink plates but all the
pink in this is side from this little

1084
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,120
pink in this is side from this little
 

1085
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,630
pink in this is side from this little
Arch is a 1ex one brick cuz I got that a

1086
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:03,640
Arch is a 1ex one brick cuz I got that a
 

1087
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,110
Arch is a 1ex one brick cuz I got that a
whole bunch of those in pick a brick and

1088
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,120
whole bunch of those in pick a brick and
 

1089
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,789
whole bunch of those in pick a brick and
then the windows here are the uh 1X twox

1090
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:09,799
then the windows here are the uh 1X twox
 

1091
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,549
then the windows here are the uh 1X twox
two tall windows again from pick a brick

1092
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:13,559
two tall windows again from pick a brick
 

1093
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,190
two tall windows again from pick a brick
and uh got a whole bunch of uh gray

1094
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,200
and uh got a whole bunch of uh gray
 

1095
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,750
and uh got a whole bunch of uh gray
plates as I said and then just built it

1096
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:18,760
plates as I said and then just built it
 

1097
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,990
plates as I said and then just built it
sort of telescoping up so you know each

1098
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
sort of telescoping up so you know each
 

1099
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,909
sort of telescoping up so you know each
different level is

1100
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:23,919
different level is
 

1101
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,269
different level is
uh gets smaller and smaller and then the

1102
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:27,279
uh gets smaller and smaller and then the
 

1103
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,389
uh gets smaller and smaller and then the
top I've used some

1104
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:31,399

 

1105
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,710

let me Orient it this way some wind a

1106
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:33,720
let me Orient it this way some wind a
 

1107
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,590
let me Orient it this way some wind a
windscreen piece and then I've got a

1108
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
windscreen piece and then I've got a
 

1109
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,590
windscreen piece and then I've got a
whole bunch of these uh 2 by two

1110
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:38,600
whole bunch of these uh 2 by two
 

1111
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,510
whole bunch of these uh 2 by two
downward slopes in

1112
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:40,520
downward slopes in
 

1113
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,430
downward slopes in
transparent um a couple bricks in there

1114
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:43,440
transparent um a couple bricks in there
 

1115
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,470
transparent um a couple bricks in there
and then topping it off with the little

1116
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:45,480
and then topping it off with the little
 

1117
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,389
and then topping it off with the little
witch's globe or crystal ball which uh

1118
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:49,399
witch's globe or crystal ball which uh
 

1119
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,630
witch's globe or crystal ball which uh
again is imitated by that piece down

1120
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:51,640
again is imitated by that piece down
 

1121
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,789
again is imitated by that piece down
there and then the blue Bank

1122
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:54,799
there and then the blue Bank
 

1123
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,669
there and then the blue Bank
building um so again again I had a whole

1124
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679
building um so again again I had a whole
 

1125
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,230
building um so again again I had a whole
pick a brick full of these 1X two bricks

1126
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,240
pick a brick full of these 1X two bricks
 

1127
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,669
pick a brick full of these 1X two bricks
in transparent blue so I made that the

1128
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:06,679
in transparent blue so I made that the
 

1129
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:08,789
in transparent blue so I made that the
front and the back and the side of the

1130
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
front and the back and the side of the
 

1131
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,389
front and the back and the side of the
buildings sorry the front is um a whole

1132
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:13,399
buildings sorry the front is um a whole
 

1133
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:17,350
buildings sorry the front is um a whole
bunch of yellow uh transparent plates

1134
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,360
bunch of yellow uh transparent plates
 

1135
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,350
bunch of yellow uh transparent plates
and some blue transparent plates filled

1136
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,360
and some blue transparent plates filled
 

1137
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,070
and some blue transparent plates filled
in to make the be so

1138
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,080
in to make the be so
 

1139
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,029
in to make the be so
um I'll just sort of slowly pan up on

1140
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:26,039
um I'll just sort of slowly pan up on
 

1141
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,789
um I'll just sort of slowly pan up on
this so you can copy the pattern if you

1142
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
this so you can copy the pattern if you
 

1143
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,710
this so you can copy the pattern if you
want

1144
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:29,720
want
 

1145
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,830
want
to but uh you know I built the B first

1146
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:33,840
to but uh you know I built the B first
 

1147
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,470
to but uh you know I built the B first
and then

1148
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:35,480
and then
 

1149
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,230
and then
uh built the building around it the top

1150
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,240
uh built the building around it the top
 

1151
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,190
uh built the building around it the top
I decided to make it all transparent

1152
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:42,200
I decided to make it all transparent
 

1153
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,470
I decided to make it all transparent
even though the little one is not just

1154
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:45,480
even though the little one is not just
 

1155
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,509
even though the little one is not just
because I had more transparent blue

1156
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:47,519
because I had more transparent blue
 

1157
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,269
because I had more transparent blue
bricks so I had some the 2 by two

1158
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:50,279
bricks so I had some the 2 by two
 

1159
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,990
bricks so I had some the 2 by two
downward slopes again and the rest is

1160
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
downward slopes again and the rest is
 

1161
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,029
downward slopes again and the rest is
just one by two brick then I'm topping

1162
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
just one by two brick then I'm topping
 

1163
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,269
just one by two brick then I'm topping
it off with tile because uh

1164
00:27:58,269 --> 00:27:58,279
it off with tile because uh
 

1165
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,310
it off with tile because uh
studs just didn't make sense down here I

1166
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,320
studs just didn't make sense down here I
 

1167
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,310
studs just didn't make sense down here I
just did some random detailing on the

1168
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,320
just did some random detailing on the
 

1169
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,630
just did some random detailing on the
door so I didn't have a big arch piece

1170
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:05,640
door so I didn't have a big arch piece
 

1171
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,950
door so I didn't have a big arch piece
so I used some upward slopes then inside

1172
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:08,960
so I used some upward slopes then inside
 

1173
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,470
so I used some upward slopes then inside
rather than just filling out with brick

1174
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:10,480
rather than just filling out with brick
 

1175
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,230
rather than just filling out with brick
I've got some downward slopes so you get

1176
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
I've got some downward slopes so you get
 

1177
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,470
I've got some downward slopes so you get
these weird

1178
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:13,480
these weird
 

1179
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,430
these weird
shapes and I just imagine that this is

1180
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,440
shapes and I just imagine that this is
 

1181
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,190
shapes and I just imagine that this is
its address it's number five on the

1182
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:18,200
its address it's number five on the
 

1183
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,669
its address it's number five on the
street rather than it being its racing

1184
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:20,679
street rather than it being its racing
 

1185
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,190
street rather than it being its racing
number these are those half octogonal

1186
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
number these are those half octogonal
 

1187
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,029
number these are those half octogonal
plates just three stacked on top and

1188
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:26,039
plates just three stacked on top and
 

1189
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,669
plates just three stacked on top and
these are the uh sort of wing brick

1190
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
these are the uh sort of wing brick
 

1191
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,310
these are the uh sort of wing brick
piece that we've uh used in other

1192
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
piece that we've uh used in other
 

1193
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,509
piece that we've uh used in other
builds so yeah and then there's just a

1194
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:34,519
builds so yeah and then there's just a
 

1195
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,470
builds so yeah and then there's just a
little doorway down there at the bottom

1196
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:37,480
little doorway down there at the bottom
 

1197
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,710
little doorway down there at the bottom
so

1198
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
so
 

1199
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,750
so
uh yeah that is uh basically how I've

1200
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:42,760
uh yeah that is uh basically how I've
 

1201
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,630
uh yeah that is uh basically how I've
built uh all these different buildings

1202
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
built uh all these different buildings
 

1203
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,430
built uh all these different buildings
uh so now you can put them all together

1204
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,440
uh so now you can put them all together
 

1205
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,350
uh so now you can put them all together
and have your own little uh downtown new

1206
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:52,360
and have your own little uh downtown new
 

1207
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:59,150
and have your own little uh downtown new
Block City

1208
