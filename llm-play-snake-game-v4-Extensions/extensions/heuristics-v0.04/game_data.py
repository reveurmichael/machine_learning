"""
Heuristic Game Data - Data tracking for heuristic algorithms
----------------

This module extends BaseGameData to add heuristic-specific tracking
while maintaining compatibility with the base game data structure.

Design Philosophy:
- Extends BaseGameData (inherits all generic game state)
- Adds heuristic-specific metrics (algorithm name, path calculations)
- Maintains same JSON output format as Task-0 for compatibility
- Uses BaseGameStatistics instead of LLM-specific GameStatistics
- Custom TimeStats without LLM pollution
