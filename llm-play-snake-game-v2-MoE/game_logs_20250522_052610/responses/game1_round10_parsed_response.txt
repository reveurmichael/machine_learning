{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (1,0) and needs to reach the apple at (6,6). The strategy is to move right five times to reach x=6 at y=0, then move up six times to reach y=6. This way, the snake doesn't collide with its body and doesn't reverse direction immediately after a move."}
