<think>
Alright, let's tackle this Snake problem step by step. The snake is at (7,7), and the apple is at (5,9). My goal is to find a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its body or going out of bounds.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (7,7), moving to the right. The body cells are [(6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]. So, the snake is a long line starting from the head and extending down towards (4,5). 

The apple is at (5,9), which is two units to the left and two units up from the head. To get there, the snake needs to move left twice and up twice. But I have to be careful about the body's movement because each move affects the entire body.

I can't reverse direction immediately since the current direction is RIGHT. So, the first move can't be LEFT or DOWN (since RIGHT's opposite is LEFT). Wait, no—the current direction is RIGHT, so the next move can't be LEFT. Because reversing isn't allowed; you can't go back on your previous direction.

So from RIGHT, I can choose UP, DOWN, or stay in RIGHT? Or wait, the movement rules say that you can't reverse—meaning if you're going right, you can't go left next, but other directions are okay. So first move options: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

But moving to the right would take me further away from the apple, which is at (5,9). So probably better to change direction upwards or leftwards.

Wait, no—the apple is two units left and two up from the head. So perhaps a path that goes up twice and then left twice? Or maybe another combination.

But I need to think about each move carefully because moving into a body segment could cause collision.

Let me visualize the grid:

The head is at (7,7). The body behind it is (6,7), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5).

If I move UP first, the new head would be (7,8). Is this position safe? It's not part of the body except for the tail which might vacate if we don't eat an apple. Wait, no—the body is [(6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]. So (7,8) isn't occupied by any body cell, so it's safe.

So the first move could be UP to (7,8). Now, after moving up, I need to check if this leads me closer to the apple. The distance is still two left and one up from the apple.

Next, another UP would take me to (7,9), which is off the grid because y can't exceed 9? Wait, no—the coordinates are from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. So (7,9) is valid. But then I'm still two units left of the apple.

But wait, after moving up twice, the head would be at (7,9), which is one row above the current position but not yet near the apple.

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT first. From (7,7), moving LEFT takes me to (6,7). But that's where the body segment is immediately behind the head. According to the collision rules, new_head can't coincide with any BODYi except when it's the tail about to move. So if I move LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7), which is the first body cell, that would be a collision because the body hasn't moved yet. Therefore, moving LEFT is not allowed as the first move.

So the first move can't be LEFT. Next options are UP or DOWN.

Moving DOWN from (7,7) would take me to (7,6), which is occupied by another body segment. So that's a collision too. So moving DOWN isn't safe either.

Therefore, the only safe initial moves are UP or RIGHT. But since moving right takes me away from the apple and may not be optimal, I think the best first move is UP to (7,8).

Now, after moving up to (7,8), what's next? The body will update: the old head (7,7) becomes the new BODY1, so the body cells become [(7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]. 

Now, I'm at (7,8). Next, I can choose a direction again. Since my current direction was UP, I can't reverse to DOWN next.

The apple is now at (5,9), which is two units left and one up from me. So perhaps the next move should be LEFT to get closer.

But wait, moving LEFT from (7,8) would take me to (6,8). Is that position safe? Let's check the body: after the first move, the body is [(7,7), (6,7), ...], so (6,8) isn't part of the body. So it's safe.

So second move could be LEFT to (6,8).

Now, I'm at (6,8). Next, I can choose another direction except for RIGHT since my previous was LEFT. But wait, no—the current direction after two moves is UP then LEFT, so the last direction is LEFT. So next, I can't choose RIGHT.

Wait, no—each move's direction affects the next possible directions. After moving UP, the direction becomes UP; then moving LEFT sets the new direction to LEFT.

So from (6,8), my current direction is LEFT. Next, I can't go RIGHT.

I need to get closer to the apple at (5,9). So maybe another LEFT move? That would take me to (5,8). But let's see if that's safe.

After moving left to (5,8), the body would update: old head (6,8) becomes BODY1. The new body is [(6,8), (7,7), ...]. So (5,8) isn't occupied by any body cells except potentially the tail.

Wait, after each move, the body grows or shrinks depending on whether we ate an apple. In this case, since we haven't eaten yet, the body remains the same length minus one unless we eat.

But in our first two moves, we didn't eat the apple because it's at (5,9). So moving to (5,8) is safe as long as that position isn't occupied by any current body cell except perhaps the tail about to move.

Looking back: after the second move, the body cells are [(6,7), (7,7)]? Wait no—after first move, body becomes [old head (7,7), then previous body], and since we didn't eat, the tail is removed. So initial body length was 5; after moving up, it's now 4: [(7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6)].

Wait, no—the movement rule says that when not eating apple, you remove the last element of BODY. So starting with body cells [B1, B2, B3, B4, B5], after moving and not eating apple, the new body becomes [old head] + [B1, B2, B3], because the tail is removed.

Wait, no—step 3c says: if not eating apple, remove last element. So initial body cells are [(6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]. After moving up to (7,8) and not eating apple, the new body is [old head (7,7)] + body cells except tail: so body becomes [(7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6)]. Because we add old head to front and remove tail.

Wait no—wait step 3a says insert old head at front of BODY list. So initial body after movement is [old_head] + current_body. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element (tail).

So let's retrace:

Initial state: HEAD=(7,7), body=[(6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)].

First move: UP to (7,8). Since new_head is safe, update body:

a. Insert old head (7,7) at front → body becomes [(7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)].

b. Since new_head != apple, remove last element → body is now [(7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)].

So the new body has 5 segments.

Now, after first move: HEAD=(7,8), BODY=[(7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)].

Second move: choose LEFT. New_head is (6,8).

Check collision: (6,8) not in body except possibly when the tail moves. The current body is [(7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]. So (6,8) isn't part of the body, so safe.

Update body:

a. Insert old head (7,8) at front → body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6)].

b. Remove last element since not eating apple → new body is [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6)].

So now, HEAD=(6,8), BODY=[(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6)].

Third move: current direction is LEFT. Can't choose RIGHT. So options are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

If I go LEFT again to (5,8):

Check collision: (5,8) not in body → safe.

Update body:

a. Insert old head (6,8) at front → [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)].

b. Remove last element → new body is [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7)].

Now, HEAD=(5,8), BODY=[(6,8), (7,8), (7,7)].

Next move: direction was LEFT again, can't go RIGHT.

Need to get to (5,9). So next move should be UP.

Moving UP from (5,8) to (5,9):

Check collision: body is [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7)]. (5,9) isn't in body → safe.

Update body:

a. Insert old head (5,8) at front → [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8)].

b. Remove last element since not eating apple → new body is [(5,8), (6,8)].

Now, HEAD=(5,9). We've reached the apple! So in this case, we eat the apple and don't remove the tail.

So after eating the apple, the body becomes [old_head] + current_body → [(5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8)].

Wait, no—the process is:

When you eat an apple, step 3b says: don't remove the last element. So when we move to (5,9) and eat the apple, the body becomes [(old_head=5,8), (5,8's previous position?), wait no.

Wait, let me recheck the movement steps:

When moving, you insert old head at front of body, then if you eat apple, keep it; else remove last element.

So in this case, after moving to (5,9):

a. Insert old head (5,8) at front → [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8)].

b. Since we ate the apple, don't remove anything. So body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)]?

Wait no—the initial body before moving was [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7)]. After inserting old head (5,8) at front, it's [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)]. Since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So the new body is [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)].

So now, the snake has grown by one segment because it ate the apple.

But wait, did I reach the apple correctly? Let's see:

First move: UP to (7,8) → not eaten apple.

Second move: LEFT to (6,8) → not eaten.

Third move: LEFT to (5,8) → not eaten.

Fourth move: UP to (5,9) → eaten apple.

Yes, that seems correct. So the path is UP, LEFT, LEFT, UP.

But let me check each step again for safety:

1. Move UP from (7,7) to (7,8). Safe.
2. Move LEFT from (7,8) to (6,8). Safe.
3. Move LEFT from (6,8) to (5,8). Safe.
4. Move UP from (5,8) to (5,9). Safe.

No collisions at any step. Therefore, the sequence of moves is UP, LEFT, LEFT, UP.
</think>

The snake needs to move in a specific sequence to safely reach the apple without colliding with its body. The optimal path involves moving up first to avoid immediate collision and then strategically left and up again.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** Head at (7,7), moving right. Body cells are [(6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)].
2. **First Move - UP:** From (7,7) to (7,8). Safe as it's not occupied by any body cell except possibly the tail about to move.
3. **Second Move - LEFT:** From (7,8) to (6,8). Safe since this position isn't part of the updated body after inserting the old head.
4. **Third Move - LEFT:** From (6,8) to (5,8). Safe as it's not in the current body cells.
5. **Fourth Move - UP:** From (5,8) to (5,9), where the apple is located. Safe and results in eating the apple.

**Answer:**

The snake should move Up, then Left, then Left again, and finally Up. The sequence of moves is:

\boxed{UP, LEFT, LEFT, UP}
```

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 9). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
