<think>
Okay, I'm trying to solve this Snake problem where the head is at (6,6) and the apple is at (0,0). The snake's body is empty right now, so it's just the head. The current direction is "DOWN", but since the body is empty, that might not matter much.

First, I need to figure out a path from (6,6) to (0,0) without hitting any walls or my own body. Since the snake is length 1, there are no body segments to worry about except after it grows when it eats the apple.

I should calculate the Manhattan distance. From (6,6) to (0,0), that's a delta of -6 in both x and y directions. So I need more LEFT moves than RIGHT by 6, and more DOWN than UP by 6. But since we're starting at (6,6), which is the top-right corner, moving LEFT and DOWN will get me closer.

Wait, no. Wait, the coordinate system says that "UP" increases y, so (0,9) would be top-left? Or wait, the grid goes from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So y increases as you go up. So moving DOWN decreases y, and UP increases it.

So from (6,6), which is somewhere in the middle maybe? Wait no, (0,0) is bottom-left, so (6,6) would be towards the top-right since x increases to the right and y increases upwards.

Wait, actually, no: if (0,0) is bottom-left, then increasing y moves up. So (9,9) is top-right. So (6,6) is more towards the upper part of the grid, but not all the way.

The apple is at (0,0), which is the very bottom-left corner. So from (6,6), I need to move left 6 times and down 6 times. But since each move can only be in one direction per step, I have to plan a path that allows me to do that without getting stuck.

Since the snake starts with no body, it's just the head. The first few moves are free as long as they don't reverse the initial direction, but wait, the current direction is "DOWN", so I can't choose "UP" on the first move. Wait, no: the movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction immediately. So if the current direction is "DOWN", the next move can't be "UP". But since the snake's body is empty, maybe this constraint doesn't apply because the previous direction might not matter? Or does it?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: rule 2 says that you cannot reverse on the first move if the current direction isn't NONE. Wait no, rule 2 says:

"Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; same for LEFT and RIGHT. If current direction is "NONE" (like initial state), any first move is allowed.

In this case, the current direction is "DOWN". So the first move cannot be "UP".

Wait no: Wait, the problem says that the current direction is "DOWN", so I can't choose "UP" as my next move. But since the snake's body is empty, perhaps it's better to ignore that for now and just plan a path.

So starting at (6,6), I need to get to (0,0). Let me think about possible paths.

One straightforward way is to go all the way left first, then down. Or vice versa: go down as much as possible, then left. But since the grid is 10x10, there's plenty of space.

Wait, but going straight left from (6,6) would take me through x=5,4,3,2,1,0. That's six moves LEFT. Then I can go down from y=6 to y=0, which is six DOWN moves. So total 12 moves: all LEFT then all DOWN.

Alternatively, maybe moving down first, but given the current direction is "DOWN", my first move cannot be "UP". Wait no: the current direction is "DOWN", so I can't choose "UP" as the next move. But since it's the initial state, and the body is empty, maybe that doesn't matter because there's no body to collide with yet.

Wait, but according to rule 2, if the current direction is DOWN, you may not choose UP next. So my first move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP.

So starting at (6,6), I have options: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But since I need to go left and down, maybe moving DOWN first makes sense if possible.

Wait no, wait: from (6,6), moving DOWN would take me to y=5, so (6,5). Then I can continue moving DOWN until y=0, then move LEFT all the way. Or maybe it's better to go left first because that gets me closer in x, which is a larger delta.

Wait, but both x and y need to decrease by 6 each. So perhaps any path that reduces both coordinates appropriately will work.

But I have to make sure that after eating the apple (which will increase my body length), I don't get trapped. Also, when I eat the apple, my tail doesn't move, so I need to ensure there's space around me after that.

Let me plan a possible path:

1. Move LEFT six times: from x=6 down to 0.
2. Then move DOWN six times: from y=6 down to 0.

But wait, starting at (6,6), moving LEFT once would take me to (5,6). Then again to (4,6), etc., until (0,6). But then I need to go down to (0,0). That's a straight path without any body segments in the way initially.

But wait, after each move, my body grows if I eat the apple. Wait no: the snake only grows when it eats the apple. So before that, my body is just the head and then nothing until I start moving, adding segments as I go.

Wait no: the body list is empty, so initially, the snake is just the head. When I make a move, the old head becomes part of the body (BODY1). Then if I don't eat an apple, the tail moves, but since there's no tail yet, maybe it doesn't matter.

Wait, let me think about how movement works:

When you move, the new head is computed. Then, if no collision, the body is updated by inserting the old head at the front of the BODY list (which was empty before). So after first move, the body would be [old_head], and then if not eating an apple, we remove the tail (but since there's nothing in the body except maybe the old head?), wait no: initial body is empty.

Wait, initial S is [HEAD] + BODY list. The problem says that the body cells are given as a list from BODY1 to BODYN, which doesn't include the head. So if the body list is empty, then the snake's body after moving would be:

After first move:

- New head: e.g., (5,6) if I moved LEFT.
- The old head (6,6) becomes BODY1.

Then, since I didn't eat an apple (since apple is at (0,0)), the tail (if any) is removed. But in this case, there's no tail yet because the body was empty. So after first move, the body would be [ (6,6) ] and the head is (5,6). Then next move: new head would be (4,6), old head becomes BODY1, so body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6) ], but wait no: each time you add the old head to the front of the BODY list. So after first move:

BODY was empty.

After moving LEFT:

new_head = (5,6)

BODY is now [ (6,6) ] because we insert the old head at the front, and since there's nothing else, that's it.

But wait, no: in the movement update rule step 3a, you insert the old head at the front of the BODY list. So if the initial body was empty, after moving LEFT:

BODY becomes [ (6,6) ].

Then, step 3c: if not eating apple, remove last element (tail). But since the body is now length 1, and we're not growing, do we remove it? Wait no: when you don't eat an apple, you remove the tail, which in this case would be the only element. So after first move:

BODY becomes empty again?

Wait that can't be right. Let me recheck the movement rules.

Movement update rule step 3:

Assuming no collision and within bounds:

a. Insert old head at front of BODY list (becomes BODY1).

b. If new_head == apple, grow: do not remove tail.

c. Otherwise, move normally: remove last element (tail), so length remains same.

Wait, initial body is empty.

After first move (LEFT):

BODY becomes [old_head] = [ (6,6) ] after step 3a.

Then since new_head != apple (assuming I didn't eat the apple yet), we proceed to step 3c: remove last element of BODY. But the body now has one element, which is the old head. So removing it would leave the body empty again.

Wait that can't be right because then after each move, the body would just have the previous head for a moment and then disappear. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the rules.

Wait no: The full snake S is [HEAD] followed by BODY1, BODY2, etc., which are the segments behind the head. So when you insert the old head at the front of the body list (BODY), that becomes the new first segment after the head.

So for initial state:

HEAD = (6,6)

BODY = []

After moving LEFT to (5,6):

new_head = (5,6)

old_head = (6,6) is inserted into BODY as the first element. So now the body list is [ (6,6) ].

Then, since we didn't eat an apple, step 3c: remove last element of the body list. But the body list has only one element, which is (6,6). So after removing it, the body list becomes empty again.

Wait that would mean that each time you move without eating, your body just adds a new segment at the front and then immediately removes the tail, leaving the body length same as before. But since we started with an empty body, it's possible that the body remains empty except for the last move.

Wait no: Wait, if I start with body empty, after first move:

BODY becomes [ (6,6) ] after step 3a.

Then in step 3c, remove last element of body list. Since body is [ (6,6) ], removing it leaves body as empty.

So the snake's body is now just the head at (5,6), with no segments behind. Then next move:

Move LEFT again: new_head = (4,6).

Insert old head (5,6) into front of body list: body becomes [ (5,6) ].

Since not eating apple, remove last element: but body is now [ (5,6) ], so removing it leaves empty.

This seems like the body is just a single segment each time you move, then it disappears. That can't be right because that would mean the snake's body doesn't grow unless it eats an apple.

Wait no, wait: when you eat an apple, your body grows by adding without removing the tail. So only when you eat an apple does the body length increase.

So in normal movement (without eating), each time you move, you add a new segment at the front and remove one from the end, keeping the same length.

But if you start with an empty body, after first move:

BODY = [old_head] = [ (6,6) ]

Then since not growing, step 3c: remove last element of body list. But the body has only one element, so it becomes empty again.

Wait that would mean that your body is just the head each time you move, which doesn't make sense because then there's no body to collide with.

But in reality, when a snake moves, each new segment is added at the front, and the last segment (tail) is removed if not growing. So for a normal snake movement without eating:

new_head -> becomes head

old_head -> added to body as first segment

then remove last segment of body (if any), so body length remains same.

But in our case, initial body is empty.

After first move:

head = (5,6)

body = [ (6,6) ]

Then since not eating, we remove the tail (which is nothing, because body was empty before?), wait no: step 3c says to remove last element of the body list. So if body list has elements, you remove the last one.

But in initial case, after first move:

BODY = [ (6,6) ]

Then step 3c: remove last element (which is (6,6)), so body becomes empty again.

Wait that can't be right because then your body never grows unless you eat an apple. So when you make a move, the old head becomes part of the body, but if you don't eat, it's immediately removed, keeping the body length same as before (which was zero). So effectively, your body is just the path of the last move.

Wait no: I think I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express:

Each time you make a move:

1. Compute new_head based on direction.

2. Check for collision with walls or body segments.

3. If no collision:

   a. Insert old_head into front of BODY list (BODY becomes [old_head] + existing BODY).

   b. If new_head is apple position, then don't remove anything (grow).

   c. Else, remove the last element of the BODY list (so body length remains same as before adding step 3a).

Wait no: initial body is empty.

After first move:

BODY after step 3a: [ (6,6) ]

Then step 3c: since not eating apple, remove last element. But the last element is (6,6), so body becomes empty again.

So effectively, each time you move without eating, you add a segment at front and immediately remove it from the end, keeping the body length same as before. Since initial body was empty, after first move, body is [ (6,6) ] then removed, back to empty.

Wait that can't be right because then your body never grows unless you eat an apple. So when you make a series of moves without eating, your body just adds and removes segments each time, leaving no trace except the current head.

But in reality, the snake's body should follow behind, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules.

Wait looking back at the problem statement:

Movement update rule step 3a: Insert old_head into front of BODY list (BODY1 becomes old_head).

Then, if not eating apple, remove last element (tail) to keep same length.

So initial body is empty.

After first move (LEFT):

new_head = (5,6)

old_head = (6,6) inserted into BODY as [ (6,6) ]

since not growing, remove last element of body list: which is (6,6), so body becomes empty again.

Wait that would mean the body is just the head each time you move. That can't be right because then there's no body to collide with except when you're moving in a way that your new head would hit your own body, but since the body isn't there, perhaps it's impossible unless you make a U-turn.

Wait no: if your body is only the previous segment, then after two moves:

First move: LEFT to (5,6), body becomes [ (6,6) ], then removed, body empty.

Second move: LEFT to (4,6), body after step 3a is [ (5,6) ], then since not eating, remove last element (which is (5,6)), so body empty again.

So in this case, the body never grows unless you eat an apple. So collision with own body can only happen if you make a move that would cause your new head to be where your old head was, but since the body is cleared each time except when growing, perhaps it's impossible to collide with yourself unless you have a longer body.

Wait no: after two moves:

Move 1: LEFT to (5,6). Body becomes [ (6,6) ], then removed. So body empty.

Move 2: LEFT to (4,6). Body after step 3a is [ (5,6) ], then removed.

So in this case, there's no body segments behind the head except for the immediately previous position, which gets added and then removed each time.

Wait but if I make a move that would cause my new head to be where my old body was, perhaps it can collide. For example:

If I move LEFT twice, from (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6). After first move: body is [ (6,6) ], then removed.

After second move: body becomes [ (5,6) ], then removed.

So the head is at (4,6), and there's no body segments behind it except for the last one, which was just added and then removed. So in this case, no collision with self.

But if I make a different path where my new head would be on the same spot as an old segment that wasn't immediately previous, but since all other body segments are removed, perhaps it's impossible to collide except when you have a longer body after eating an apple.

So back to the main plan: moving LEFT six times then DOWN six times. Since initial direction is DOWN, can I choose LEFT on first move? Yes, because current direction is DOWN, so next move cannot be UP, but can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Wait no: rule 2 says you cannot reverse the previous direction. So if current direction is DOWN, next move cannot be UP. But in this case, since I'm starting fresh, perhaps the initial direction doesn't restrict me except for that.

But wait, the problem says:

"Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; same for LEFT and RIGHT. If current direction is "NONE" (like initial state), any first move is allowed.

Wait no: in this case, the current direction is DOWN, so next move cannot be UP.

So my options are: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

I need to go left and down, but perhaps starting with LEFT makes sense because that's the main delta I need to cover (x from 6 to 0).

Wait no, wait: both x and y need to decrease by 6. Maybe it's better to move in one direction as much as possible before changing.

But let me think about a possible path:

1. Move LEFT six times: each time moving left until x=0 at (0,6). That would take six moves, directions all LEFT.

Then, from (0,6), I need to go down six times to y=0.

But wait, after the first move, my body is empty again, so no collision issues. So that seems possible.

Alternatively, I could interleave LEFT and DOWN moves, but it's probably simpler to do all LEFT first then all DOWN.

So let me outline this:

Move 1: LEFT from (6,6) -> (5,6). Body becomes [ (6,6) ], then removed. So body empty.

Move 2: LEFT -> (4,6). Body [ (5,6) ] added, then removed.

... and so on until x=0 at move 6:

After six LEFT moves, head is at (0,6), with no body segments behind because each time the body was added and then removed.

Then, starting from (0,6), I need to go down six times. But wait, after the sixth LEFT move, my direction would be LEFT; can I change direction to DOWN?

Yes, as long as it's not a reversal of previous direction. Previous direction was LEFT, so next direction cannot be RIGHT.

Wait no: rule 2 says if current direction is something, you cannot reverse it. So if current direction is LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT. Similarly, if current direction is DOWN, next cannot be UP.

But in this case, after moving LEFT six times, my last move was LEFT, so I can't move RIGHT next. But I can move DOWN or any other non-reversed direction.

Wait no: the problem says "Cannot reverse" meaning that if you were going in a certain direction (e.g., LEFT), you cannot go RIGHT next, and vice versa. Similarly for UP and DOWN.

But moving from LEFT to DOWN is allowed because it's not a reversal.

So after reaching (0,6) via six LEFT moves, I can change direction to DOWN and start moving down.

Now, each time I move DOWN, my x coordinate remains 0, y decreases by 1.

I need six DOWN moves to get from y=6 to y=0.

But wait: starting at (0,6), first DOWN would take me to (0,5). Then next to (0,4), and so on until (0,0).

So in total, that's 6 + 6 = 12 moves. But I need to ensure that none of these moves cause my head to collide with any part of my body.

But as established earlier, since the body is only the immediately previous position which is then removed, there's no existing body segments except for the one just left behind, which gets cleared each time I move without eating. So in this case, no collision should occur because the body doesn't extend beyond the head and the last moved segment.

Wait but when I start moving DOWN from (0,6), my previous position was (0,6) after the sixth LEFT move. Wait no: wait, no, after six LEFT moves starting from x=6 to x=0 at y=6, each move's body is added and then removed, so by the time I finish the sixth LEFT move, my head is at (0,6), and there are no body segments behind because they were all cleared.

Wait no: Wait, let me correct this. Each time you make a move without eating, the old_head is added to the front of the body list, then if not growing, the last element is removed. So for each move:

- Move 1: LEFT from (6,6) to (5,6). Body after step 3a: [ (6,6) ]. Then step 3c: remove last element (which is (6,6)), so body empty.

Wait no, wait: The initial body is empty. After first move:

new_head = (5,6)

old_head = (6,6). Insert into front of body list: body becomes [ (6,6) ].

Then since not eating, step 3c: remove last element of body list, which is (6,6), so body is empty again.

So after first move, head is at (5,6), body is empty.

Second move: LEFT to (4,6). Insert old_head (5,6) into front of body: [ (5,6) ].

Then step 3c: remove last element (5,6), body empty again.

So after second move, head at (4,6), body empty.

This continues until sixth LEFT move:

After fifth move: head at (1,6), body empty.

Sixth move: LEFT to (0,6). Insert old_head (1,6) into body: [ (1,6) ].

Then step 3c: remove last element (1,6), so body is empty again.

Wait that can't be right because after six moves, you should have moved from x=6 to x=0. Wait no, wait:

Wait starting at (6,6):

Move 1: LEFT -> x=5 → head at (5,6). Body becomes [ (6,6) ], then removed.

Move 2: LEFT -> x=4 → body after step 3a is [ (5,6) ], then removed.

...

Move 6: LEFT to x=0 → head at (0,6). Body after step 3a is [ (1,6) ]? Wait no, wait:

Wait each move's old_head is the previous position. So when you're moving from (x+1,y) to (x,y), the old_head is (x+1,y).

So for move 1: starting at (6,6). Move LEFT to (5,6). Old_head = (6,6). Insert into body: [ (6,6) ], then removed.

Move 2: from (5,6) to (4,6). Old_head = (5,6). Insert into body: [ (5,6) ], then removed.

...

Move 6: from (1,6) to (0,6). Old_head = (1,6). Insert into body: [ (1,6) ], then step 3c: remove last element → body empty.

So after six moves, head is at (0,6), and body is empty.

Then, starting to move DOWN from (0,6):

Move 7: DOWN to (0,5). Old_head = (0,6). Insert into body: [ (0,6) ].

Since not eating, step 3c: remove last element → body empty again.

But wait, if I'm moving DOWN, my direction changes. So after move 6, I was moving LEFT; now I change to DOWN for move 7.

Wait but the problem says you can't reverse directions. Wait no, it's only that you can't reverse the previous direction. So if last move was LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT. But moving DOWN is allowed because it's not a reversal of LEFT (which would be RIGHT).

So after six LEFT moves, I can change to DOWN.

Now, for each DOWN move:

Move 7: DOWN from (0,6) → (0,5). Body becomes [ (0,6) ], then removed. So body empty.

Move 8: DOWN → (0,4). Body after step 3a: [ (0,5) ].

Then remove last element → body empty.

...

Continue until move 12: from (0,1) to (0,0).

Wait but wait: starting at y=6, moving down six times would take me to y=0. So that's six moves:

Move 7: y=5

Move 8: y=4

Move 9: y=3

Move 10: y=2

Move 11: y=1

Move 12: y=0.

So after move 12, I would have reached (0,0), with no body segments except the last one added and then removed each time.

But wait, when I reach (0,0) on move 12, my old_head was (0,1). Insert into body: [ (0,1) ], then step 3c: remove last element → body empty again.

So in this entire path, from (6,6) to (5,6)...(0,6), then down to (0,0), I don't have any body segments except the immediately previous position which is added and then removed each time. Therefore, there's no risk of collision with my own body during these moves.

However, I need to ensure that when changing direction from LEFT to DOWN at (0,6), there's no immediate collision. Since after move 6, I'm at (0,6) with body empty. Then moving DOWN to (0,5): old_head is (0,6), added to body, then removed.

So in this case, the path seems clear.

But wait: when I start moving DOWN from (0,6), my head is at (0,6). The next position is (0,5). But what about any existing segments? Since the body was empty after move 6, there's nothing blocking me.

Wait no: in this case, since the body is empty except for the last step which was removed, I don't have any body parts to collide with when moving DOWN from (0,6).

So in total, it would take 12 moves to reach (0,0) without colliding with walls or own body.

Wait but wait: The problem says "You are given a grid" but doesn't specify if the grid is surrounded by walls. I assume that the snake cannot move beyond certain boundaries, like x can't be less than 0 or greater than some max value, same for y. But in this case, since we're starting at (6,6) and moving LEFT to x=0, then DOWN to y=0, assuming the grid allows movement all the way to (0,0), which is a valid position.

But wait: if I'm at x=0 and try to move further left (LEFT again), it would be invalid. But in this case, after reaching x=0, we change direction to DOWN, so no issue.

So yes, the path from (6,6) → LEFT six times to (0,6), then DOWN six times to (0,0) is a valid path without collisions.

But wait: Wait, when I'm at (0,6) and move DOWN to (0,5), my new position is (0,5). The old_head was (0,6). So the body after step 3a would have [ (0,6) ], then removed. So no issue.

But wait another thing: if I'm at (0,6), moving LEFT further would be invalid because x can't be less than 0. But since we've already reached x=0 via six LEFT moves and then change direction to DOWN, that's fine.

So in conclusion, the minimal number of steps is 12, but perhaps there's a shorter path if I move diagonally or something? Wait no, because movement seems to be axis-aligned (only horizontal or vertical), not diagonal. So each move changes either x or y by one unit.

Wait wait, no: the problem says "You are given a grid" and you can move in four directions—up, down, left, right—so yes, only orthogonal moves, no diagonals. Therefore, moving from (6,6) to (0,0) requires 6 LEFT and 6 DOWN moves, totaling 12 steps.

But wait: wait a second—if I'm allowed to move in any direction each step, perhaps there's a way to reach (0,0) faster? No, because you have to cover six units left and six units down, so it's 12 steps regardless of order. So the minimal number is indeed 12.

But wait: let me confirm—could I somehow combine some moves or find a shorter path? For example, if moving in certain patterns allows me to reach (0,0) faster. But no, because each step can only change one coordinate by one unit. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is indeed 12.

Wait but wait: wait, the problem says "the snake's head cannot collide with any part of its body." So as long as during each move, the new position (head) doesn't overlap with any existing body segments, it's okay. But in this case, since the body only consists of the immediately previous segment which is then removed after each step, there's no overlapping.

Wait no: wait, when moving from (0,6) to (0,5), the body would have [ (0,6) ] added, but since we're moving to (0,5), and the body only includes up to (0,6), which is not in conflict with (0,5). Then after that move, the body is emptied again.

Wait no: Wait, each time you make a move, the old_head is added to the front of the body list. So for example:

After move 1: head at (5,6), body [ (6,6) ] → then remove last element (since not eating), body empty.

Move 2: head at (4,6), body [ (5,6) ] → remove last element, body empty.

...

So after each move, the body is only temporarily holding the previous position, which is immediately removed if no food was eaten. Therefore, when moving from (0,6) to (0,5), the body would have [ (0,6) ], but since we're not eating any food, the body remains empty after that step.

Wait no: Wait, no—when you move without eating, your body doesn't grow; it just moves forward. So perhaps I've misunderstood how the body works. Let me clarify:

The snake's body follows the head, so each time the head moves, the tail also moves forward unless the snake eats food (which would make it grow). But in this problem, there's no mention of eating, so perhaps the snake's length remains constant.

Wait wait! Wait a minute—I think I made a mistake earlier. The initial problem statement says "You are given a grid" but doesn't specify whether the snake is growing or not. If the snake isn't growing (i.e., it has a fixed length), then as the head moves forward, the tail also moves forward, keeping the length constant.

Wait that's a crucial point! I think I assumed earlier that the body was being cleared after each move, but actually, if the snake is of fixed length, moving the head requires the tail to move as well. So for example, if the snake starts at (6,6), and moves LEFT to (5,6), then its body would now be [(6,6)]? Or wait, no—wait, the snake's body is a sequence of connected segments. If it's of length 1, moving wouldn't change anything. But in this problem, perhaps we're considering that the snake can grow or not.

Wait but the initial problem statement doesn't mention food or growth; it only mentions that the head cannot collide with any part of its body. So I think the snake is of fixed size, say length N, and each move shifts the entire body forward by one segment without growing.

But since the problem doesn't specify the initial length of the snake, perhaps we can assume that it's just the head (length 1), meaning that moving anywhere won't cause a collision because there's no body to collide with. But that seems unlikely; probably, the snake has an initial body behind the head.

Wait but without knowing the initial position and length of the body, how can I determine possible collisions? Maybe the problem assumes that the snake is just the head, so moving any direction won't cause collision because there's no body segments to collide with. But that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake starts at a certain position with some initial body, but since it's not specified, maybe we can assume that the body doesn't extend beyond the head, meaning no collisions are possible as long as the head is moving in any direction without crossing its own path.

Wait this is getting confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement:

"You are given a grid" — no details about size or what's on it.

"The snake can move up, down, left, right." — movement directions.

"The snake's head cannot collide with any part of its body."

So to model this: the snake is represented by a sequence of connected coordinates (its body), and the head is at the front. Each move shifts the entire snake forward in one direction, adding a new segment at the head and removing the last segment if the snake isn't growing.

But since there's no mention of food or growth, perhaps the snake's length remains constant. So each move would be like shifting all segments forward by one, so the head moves in the chosen direction, and the tail follows by moving into the previous position of the second segment, etc.

Wait but if that's the case, then the snake's body is always a continuous line, and when you make a move, the entire body shifts. So for example:

If the snake starts as [ (6,6), (5,6) ], meaning it's two segments long with the head at (6,6). Then if it moves LEFT, it would become [ (5,6), (4,6) ].

Wait no, wait: when moving LEFT from (6,6), the new head is at (5,6). If the snake was previously at [ (6,6), (5,6) ], then after moving LEFT, it becomes [ (5,6), (4,6) ]? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait no: actually, when a snake moves in a direction, all body segments follow. So for example:

If the snake is at positions [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn)], with (x1,y1) being the head, then moving LEFT would change each segment to the next one's position, and the new head would be at (x1-1,y1).

Wait no: more accurately, when the snake moves in a direction, each body part follows the path of the previous one. So:

Original positions: [A, B, C], where A is the head.

After moving LEFT, the new positions would be [B's position, C's position, (A.x-1, A.y)]? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait no: think of it as each segment follows the one in front. So when the head moves left, the next segment takes the place of the head, and so on, with the tail either moving or being removed if the snake isn't growing.

But without knowing whether the snake is growing or not, this complicates things. Since the problem doesn't mention food or growth, perhaps we can assume that the snake's length remains constant, meaning that when it moves forward, the tail also moves forward, preventing any shrinkage but keeping the same overall length.

Wait no: Wait, in most snake games, if you don't eat food, moving forward causes the tail to follow, so the snake doesn't grow. So perhaps the snake's body shifts as a whole without changing its length.

So let's model this:

Snake starts at (6,6) as head, with body segments behind it—though since the initial problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume that the snake is just the head, meaning no body to collide with. But that would make any movement possible as long as you don't run into walls.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake's body is a single line of connected blocks, so moving in any direction could cause the head to move into the path where its body was, but only if it turns around on itself.

Wait this is getting too vague. Maybe I should proceed with an assumption that the snake's body doesn't extend beyond the head (i.e., length 1), meaning there's no collision possible because there are no other body segments to collide with.

But then why would the problem mention "the snake's head cannot collide with any part of its body"? If the body is just the head, that statement wouldn't make sense. So perhaps the snake has a longer body initially, and as it moves, parts of its body could end up in positions where the head might collide with them.

But without knowing the initial configuration, I can't model this accurately. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things.

Perhaps the key is that the snake must move from (6,6) to (0,0), and we need to find a path where none of the steps cause the head to be on a square that's part of its body at that time.

But again, without knowing the initial body configuration, it's hard to say. Maybe the problem assumes that the snake starts in such a way that as long as we move directly towards (0,0), we won't collide with our own body.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps is 12 (6 left and 6 down) and there are no obstacles or body parts to collide with along the way. So the snake can just go straight left six times and then straight down six times, totaling 12 moves without any collisions.

Yes, that makes sense. The path would be:

(6,6) → (5,6) → (4,6) → (3,6) → (2,6) → (1,6) → (0,6)

Then,

(0,6) → (0,5) → (0,4) → (0,3) → (0,2) → (0,1) → (0,0)

Total of 12 moves. Since the snake's body follows the path, but as it moves forward, each step only adds a new head position and removes the tail, so there's no possibility of collision if moving straight in one direction.

Wait no: Wait, if the snake is longer than one segment, then when you make a turn, the body could get in the way. But in this case, since we're not making any turns except at (0,6) where we change from left to down, but that's a corner, and as long as we move straight after that, there shouldn't be any collisions.

Wait no: wait, when you make the turn at (0,6), your body might have parts extending in the previous direction. But since we're moving directly downward after reaching x=0, I think it should be safe.

So yes, 12 moves is possible without collision.
</think>

The snake can move from (6,6) to (0,0) by first moving left six times and then down six times, totaling 12 steps. Since there are no obstacles or body segments in the way during this straight path, there's no risk of collision.

$\boxed{12}$

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (0, 0).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
