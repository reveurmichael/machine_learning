========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (0,9), and the apple is at (7,2). The snake's body is behind it, extending from (1,9) to (4,9). The current direction is LEFT, so the head was moving left before, but now we need to plan a new path.

First, I need to understand the movement rules. The snake can't reverse its direction immediately. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

Looking at the grid, moving LEFT from (0,9) isn't an option because that would take the head out of bounds. So the initial options are UP or DOWN.

The apple is located at (7,2), which is 7 units to the right and 7 units down from the current head position. Since the snake can't move right immediately due to the LEFT direction constraint, we need a path that eventually allows moving right without causing collisions with its own body.

Let me consider moving DOWN first. From (0,9), moving DOWN would take the head to (0,8). Then, from there, moving RIGHT is allowed since it's not reversing. This could start a path towards the apple.

However, I need to ensure that each move doesn't cause the head to collide with its body segments. The body is currently at (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), and (4,9). So moving DOWN from the head would avoid these initially.

Let me outline possible moves:

1. Move DOWN to (0,8).
2. Then move RIGHT multiple times to reach x=7.
3. Ensure that during this movement, the body doesn't block the path.

But wait, after the first move down, the body will shift. The tail might be moving as well, so I need to track how the body changes with each move to avoid collisions.

Another approach is to move UP first to (0,10), but that's out of bounds. So DOWN is the only option initially.

After moving DOWN to (0,8), the next possible moves can include RIGHT without reversing. Let me simulate a few steps:

- Move 1: DOWN to (0,8). Body becomes [(0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9)].
- Move 2: RIGHT to (1,8). Now, check for collisions with body segments. The new head is at (1,8). The body includes (0,9), which is not the same as (1,8). So safe.

Continuing this way, moving right and down alternately might help reach the apple without collision. However, I need to make sure that each step doesn't lead into any part of the body except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

Wait, but in the initial state, after moving DOWN, the body is [(0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9)]. So the tail is at (3,9). When we move RIGHT from (0,8), the new head is (1,8), and the body shifts accordingly.

I think a step-by-step simulation would help. Let's outline a possible path:

Move 1: DOWN to (0,8)
Move 2: RIGHT to (1,8)
Move 3: RIGHT to (2,8)
...
But I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause the head to hit any body segments.

Alternatively, maybe moving in a spiral or some pattern to navigate around the body and reach the apple.

Wait, perhaps it's better to first move DOWN as much as possible to get away from the initial body position, then start moving RIGHT. Let me try that.

But I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way. Another thought: since the apple is far away, the snake might need to grow longer, which means more moves and careful planning to avoid self-collisions.

I think the key here is to plan a path that allows the snake to move towards the apple without immediately stepping into its own body, considering how the body shifts after each move. Since reversing isn't allowed initially, I have to make sure the first move doesn't close any necessary paths.

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves DOWN to (0,8) to avoid immediate collision with its body, then turns RIGHT towards the apple at (7,2)."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 9) and whose body cells are in list format [(1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (7, 2). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
