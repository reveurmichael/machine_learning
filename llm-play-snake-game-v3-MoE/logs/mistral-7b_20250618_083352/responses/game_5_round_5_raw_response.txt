 {
     "moves": ["RIGHT"],
     "reasoning": "The head is at (5,1) and the apple is at (6,0). To move towards the apple while avoiding immediate self-collision and ensuring continuity of the body, we choose 'RIGHT'. This move takes us one step closer to the apple without reversing direction or moving into a cell occupied by the tail."
