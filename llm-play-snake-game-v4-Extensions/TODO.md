Unifying the main.py and main_web.py mode (with OOP, already some first success), then replay.py and replay_web.py mode with OOP. Then human play pygame mode and web mode.

Web mode needs a lot of work to do for reducing code redundancy.

Replay mode is not working 100% yet. UI is 100% OK, but game control logic is not using the existing shared control logic? 
 A lot of small bugs. Should not have switched to MVC ! So much pain.
