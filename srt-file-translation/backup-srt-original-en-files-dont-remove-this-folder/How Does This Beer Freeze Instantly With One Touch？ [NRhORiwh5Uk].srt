1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,669

That is kind of gross. But hey, watch

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
That is kind of gross. But hey, watch
 

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,150
That is kind of gross. But hey, watch
this. She scrapes a tiny bit of frost

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
this. She scrapes a tiny bit of frost
 

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,310
this. She scrapes a tiny bit of frost
off the bottle with her fingernail and

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
off the bottle with her fingernail and
 

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,390
off the bottle with her fingernail and
casually drops it into the beer. Then

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
casually drops it into the beer. Then
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,790
casually drops it into the beer. Then
her beer freezes immediately. So what

10
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:12,800
her beer freezes immediately. So what
 

11
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,509
her beer freezes immediately. So what
just happened? The beer is super cooled.

12
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
just happened? The beer is super cooled.
 

13
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,590
just happened? The beer is super cooled.
Super cooling involves cooling a liquid

14
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600
Super cooling involves cooling a liquid
 

15
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,830
Super cooling involves cooling a liquid
below its freezing point without turning

16
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
below its freezing point without turning
 

17
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,990
below its freezing point without turning
it into a solid. Now when the beer is

18
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
it into a solid. Now when the beer is
 

19
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,150
it into a solid. Now when the beer is
disturbed, even just by dropping a bit

20
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
disturbed, even just by dropping a bit
 

21
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,990
disturbed, even just by dropping a bit
of frost in, it gives the water

22
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
of frost in, it gives the water
 

23
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,710
of frost in, it gives the water
molecules a perfect spot to latch onto.

24
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
molecules a perfect spot to latch onto.
 

25
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,630
molecules a perfect spot to latch onto.
And just like that, the beer instantly

26
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
And just like that, the beer instantly
 

27
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
And just like that, the beer instantly
freezes.
