You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, so I need to help plan a safe path for the snake's head from (3,2) to the apple at (2,2). Let me start by understanding all the rules and constraints.

First, the snake's current position is given as (3,2), which is the head. The body cells are provided in the input, but since I don't have them here, I'll assume they might be empty or occupied with other segments. The problem states that the input includes ordered list of body positions from behind to tail.

The apple is at (2,2). So my goal is to move the head from (3,2) to (2,2) without dying. Let's think about possible moves step by step.

Since the current direction isn't given, but in the problem statement, it says "the provided Body cells list" includes positions from behind the head to tail. So perhaps I need to consider the initial state and how moving affects the body.

Wait, maybe the input is not necessary for this example because the user only gave specific inputs: head at (3,2), direction "LEFT", body cells [], apple at (2,2). Hmm, but without knowing the exact body segments, perhaps I should think about possible paths based on standard rules.

But wait, in the problem statement, the user provides a movement example where moving "LEFT" from (4,4) to (3,4), which suggests that the snake moves in such a way. However, since we're given specific head position and direction, maybe I need to consider possible directions based on current state.

Wait, perhaps the current direction is not provided because it's part of the input parameters for the function? Let me check: the problem says "the given inputs" include head position, current direction, body cells, and apple. So in this case, perhaps the direction is something else, or maybe I need to infer based on possible movement.

Wait, but in the example provided earlier, when moving from (4,4) with direction LEFT, they moved to (3,4). But in our problem, the head is at (3,2), and direction is "LEFT", so perhaps the current direction is given as part of the input. Wait no, looking back: the user's input includes head position, direction, body cells, and apple. So perhaps I need to consider that the direction is not necessarily "LEFT" because it's a variable.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to proceed step by step.

The snake's current position is (3,2), which is the head. The direction could be any of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE. But perhaps in this case, since the problem requires moving towards the apple at (2,2), and the head is at (3,2) while the apple is at (2,2), perhaps moving left would bring the head closer.

But wait, if current direction is "LEFT", then new_head would be (3-1, 2) = (2,2). So that's exactly where the apple is. Therefore, if the snake moves in the LEFT direction from (3,2), it would reach the apple position immediately without any collision because there's no body to collide with.

But wait, let me check the movement rules. When checking for collisions, we need to ensure that moving into a new cell does not coincide with any body except the tail when it moves next turn. However, since this is the first move and we're about to eat the apple, perhaps it's acceptable because the tail is yet to be determined.

Wait, but in the problem statement, if the snake chooses to move towards the apple, which is at (2,2), then moving LEFT from (3,2) would take us directly to (2,2). So that seems optimal. But I need to ensure that this movement doesn't cause any collision with existing body segments.

Given that the snake's initial state includes a head and possibly some body cells behind it. Let me think about possible scenarios:

1. If moving LEFT from (3,2) is allowed because there are no body segments in the way except the tail which hasn't moved yet. Since this is the first move, perhaps the snake can proceed without worrying about future moves.

Therefore, perhaps the direction to take is "LEFT".

But wait, let me check if that's possible. If the head is at (3,2), moving LEFT would place it at (2,2), which is exactly where the apple is. So yes, this seems safe because there are no body segments blocking in the path yet.

Therefore, the move sequence should be ["MOVELEFT"].

But let me verify if any movement rules might prevent this. For example, if moving into the same cell as a body segment would cause a collision. But since it's the first move, and we're about to eat the apple, perhaps this is acceptable because the tail hasn't moved yet.

Therefore, the solution is to move left from (3,2) to (2,2), which is the apple position.

{
"moves": ["LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake's head is at (3,2). Moving 'LEFT' takes it directly to (2,2), where the apple is located. This movement is safe as there are no body segments in between and it does not collide with any existing segments or the tail since this is the first move."
}

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 2) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (2, 2).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
