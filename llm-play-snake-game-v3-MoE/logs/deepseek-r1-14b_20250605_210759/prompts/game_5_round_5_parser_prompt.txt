BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the snake from (2,0) to eat the apple at (7,6). The current direction is LEFT, and the body cells are [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]. 

First, let me visualize the grid. The snake's head is at (2,0), which is on the bottom-left side. The apple is way up at (7,6), which is near the top-right corner.

The current direction is LEFT, so the snake was moving left before this step. But I can't reverse direction immediately. Wait, no—since the direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing? Or wait, the rules say you cannot choose the opposite direction of the current direction. So if it's LEFT now, next move can't be RIGHT. So from LEFT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But looking at the head position (2,0), moving LEFT would take it to (1,0). Is that safe? Let me check the body cells. The body is [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]. So if I move LEFT from (2,0) to (1,0), does that collide with any body part except possibly the tail?

The current body after moving would be: new head is (1,0). The old head (2,0) becomes BODY1. Then the rest follows. But wait, when moving, we have to check if new_head collides with any BODYi except when it's the tail about to move.

In this case, the current body doesn't include (1,0), so it's safe? Wait no—because the snake is currently at (2,0) and direction is LEFT. If I move LEFT again, would that cause a collision?

Wait, let me clarify: The body cells given are from the head to the tail. So after moving, the new head is added to the front, and the tail is removed unless we eat an apple.

But in this case, if I choose to go LEFT, which is possible because it's not opposite of current direction (which is LEFT; wait, no—current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. So moving LEFT again is allowed because it's the same direction as before.

Wait, but movement rules say you cannot reverse: if current direction is UP, can't choose DOWN next. But choosing the same direction is fine? Or does it mean that you can't make a 180-degree turn, so for example, from LEFT to RIGHT is not allowed, but moving in the same direction or other directions are okay.

So yes, moving LEFT again is allowed.

But I think maybe moving directly towards the apple is better. The apple is at (7,6), which is right and up from the current head position.

The Manhattan distance is 5 in x-direction and 6 in y-direction. So the snake needs to move mostly RIGHT and UP.

But considering that the body is currently extending from (2,0) to (4,0) then turns up. So moving LEFT again might cause issues because the body could block the path.

Wait, if I'm at (2,0), and direction is LEFT, but the next move can't be RIGHT because it's the opposite. Hmm, no—current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But moving LEFT from (2,0) to (1,0) might not be safe if that position is already occupied by a body segment in the next step.

Wait, looking at the body cells: [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]. So after the head moves LEFT to (1,0), the new head is (1,0). The old head (2,0) becomes the first body part. Then, the rest of the body follows.

So when moving, we need to check if the new_head collides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when it moves this turn.

In this case, after inserting the old head into the body list, the body becomes [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]. Then, if we don't eat an apple, the tail (4,2) would be removed. But since moving LEFT doesn't lead to eating the apple, which is at (7,6), so no growth.

So when checking collision after new_head is (1,0), does it collide with any body part? The body parts are now [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]. So (1,0) is not in that list. Therefore, moving LEFT is safe.

But I'm not sure if this is the best move because we need to reach (7,6). Maybe it's better to start moving RIGHT or UP instead of LEFT again.

Wait, but the current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. 

If I choose UP, moving from (2,0) to (2,1), which is not occupied by any body part except perhaps after movement.

The body would become [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)] when the new head is added. Then, since we're moving UP and not eating an apple, the tail (4,2) would be removed. So collision check for new_head (2,1): it's not in [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)].

So moving UP is safe as well.

But wait, if I move UP to (2,1), which is directly above the head's current position. The body is behind, so no collision. So both LEFT and UP are possible next moves.

But since we need to reach (7,6), it's better to start moving towards that direction as soon as possible. 

Given that the apple is at (7,6), which is 5 units to the right and 6 up from the head's current position, I think the optimal path would involve moving mostly RIGHT and UP.

However, since the current direction is LEFT, the first move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing. Wait no—the current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT because it's opposite. So first move options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.

So I can't go directly towards the apple in the x-direction (RIGHT) on the first move because of the direction restriction.

Therefore, the best initial moves would be to either turn upwards and then start moving right or to move left a bit and then turn up.

But let's think about the body's current state. The snake is currently extending from (2,0) to (3,0), (4,0), etc. So if I move UP first, it could help in avoiding the body as I start moving towards the apple.

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT and then turning up would be better, but since I can't reverse direction immediately, perhaps moving UP is a safer first step.

Wait, but let me see: If I move UP to (2,1), then next move could be RIGHT or whatever. But if I stay in the same column, it might allow for easier movement towards the apple without getting blocked by the body.

Alternatively, moving LEFT first might bring the head closer to a position where the body isn't blocking as much.

Hmm. Let's consider both possibilities.

Option 1: Move UP first.

After moving UP from (2,0) to (2,1), the new head is (2,1). The body becomes [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)] plus inserting old head at front. Wait no—the initial movement step:

When you move in a direction, the new_head is computed. Then, the old head is added to the front of the body list. So after moving UP, the new_head is (2,1). The old head (2,0) becomes the first body segment.

Then, since we're not eating an apple, the tail is removed. So the body would be [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]. Because after adding the old head, it's [ (2,0), 3,0; 4,0;4,1;4,2], but then we remove the tail, so it becomes [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)].

Now, from this new position, I can choose next moves. Since current direction is now UP, next move cannot be DOWN. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

But moving towards the apple would require going right and up. So perhaps after moving UP once, the next move can be RIGHT.

Wait, but after moving UP to (2,1), the body includes (3,0) which is one step to the right. But since we're now facing UP, moving RIGHT is allowed because it's not opposite direction.

So from (2,1), moving RIGHT to (3,1). Let me check for collisions:

The new head would be (3,1). The body list before movement is [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]. So new_head (3,1) needs to not collide with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when it moves.

In this case, (3,1) is not in the body list, so it's safe. Then, after moving RIGHT, the body becomes [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)] plus inserting old head at front: (3,1) becomes new head, and then body starts with (2,1), but wait no—after moving, the new_head is added to the front of the body list.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

When you move, the steps are:

1. Compute new_head based on current direction.
2. Check if new_head collides with any BODYi except possibly the tail's position after movement (if the tail would move there).
3. If safe, update the body list by adding old head to front and removing tail unless eating apple.

So in this case, moving from (2,0) with direction LEFT is not what I'm considering. Wait no—initial current direction is LEFT, but in option 1, first move is UP.

Wait, initial current direction is LEFT, so when I decide to move, the next direction cannot be RIGHT because that's reversing. So after moving UP, the new current direction would be UP, and then next moves can't be DOWN.

But let me focus on the first move: from (2,0), direction is LEFT, but can choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

If I choose UP as the first move:

- New head: (2,1)
- Check collision with current body [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]. So new_head (2,1) is not in this list except possibly if the tail moves. But since after movement, the tail would move from (4,2) to wherever it's connected.

Wait, no—the body cells are [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]. After moving UP, the new head is (2,1). The old head (2,0) becomes the first body cell. Then the rest follows: (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), and then we remove the tail (4,2) because we're not eating an apple.

So the new body list would be [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)].

Now, from this position, I can move towards the apple. The next step could be moving RIGHT to (3,1). Let's check:

- New head: (3,1)
- Current body list before movement is [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]
- So new_head (3,1) is not in this list except perhaps when the tail moves. But since we're moving RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1), and the body after inserting old head would be [(2,1), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]? Wait no.

Wait, after moving UP to (2,1), the body becomes [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]. So when moving from (2,1) to (3,1):

- new_head is (3,1)
- old head (2,1) is added to front of body list: so body becomes [(2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]
- then, since not eating apple, remove tail (4,0 or 4,1? Wait, initial body after moving UP was [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]. So when adding new_head, the body becomes [ (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) ], and then remove the tail, which is (4,1). So final body list would be [(2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)].

So new_head is (3,1), which is not in the body list after removing the tail. Therefore, it's safe.

This seems manageable. Then from there, I can continue moving towards the apple.

Alternatively, if I choose to move LEFT first:

- New head: (1,0)
- Body becomes [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)], and then remove tail (4,2). So body is [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)].

From here, direction is still LEFT, but next move can't be RIGHT. So options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But moving further left may not help in getting towards the apple quickly, and could lead to a longer path with more body segments that might block movement later on.

Therefore, perhaps the first move should be UP to (2,1) instead of LEFT.

Alternatively, another thought: if I can't move RIGHT immediately because direction is LEFT, maybe after moving UP once, I can then start moving towards the apple by going RIGHT multiple times.

But let's think about the body growth. Each time we don't eat an apple, the tail shrinks by one cell. So starting from 4 body segments, each non-eating move reduces it by one until perhaps it's manageable.

But in this case, since we need to reach (7,6), which is quite a distance, maybe it's better to make sure that the path towards the apple isn't blocked by the body.

Alternatively, considering that the snake is currently extending to the right and up from (4,0) to (4,1) and (4,2). If I move UP first, then next moves can start going RIGHT without immediately conflicting with the body.

I think moving UP as the first step might be safer because it allows for a clearer path towards the apple. So the first move is UP to (2,1).

Then, the second move can be RIGHT to (3,1), and so on until reaching (7,6). 

Wait, but let me confirm if that's feasible without collision.

After moving UP to (2,1), body is [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]. So when I move RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1):

- new_head: (3,1)
- old head (2,1) added to front: body becomes [(2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]
- remove tail (4,1): final body is [(2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)]

Now, new_head (3,1) is not in the body list. So safe.

Next move can be RIGHT again to (4,1). Let's check:

- new_head: (4,1)
- old head (3,1) added to front: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)]
- remove tail (4,0): body becomes [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)]

So new_head (4,1) is now in the body list because after adding old head, (4,1) isn't there yet. Wait, no—the body before this move was [(2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)]. So when we add the old head (3,1), it's inserted at front: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)], then remove tail (4,0). So final body is [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)].

So new_head (4,1) is not in this list. Therefore, safe to move.

Now at (4,1), which was previously the end of the body, but now it's a clear path because we removed that part.

From here, I can continue moving RIGHT towards (5,1), (6,1), etc., up to (7,1), then start moving UP towards (7,2) and so on until reaching (7,6).

But wait, the apple is at (7,6). So from (4,1), if I move RIGHT all the way to (7,1), that's 3 steps. Then from there, move UP 5 times.

But each time we make a move without eating an apple, the body reduces by one cell. So after moving up, how many cells would the snake have?

Let me track:

Starting moves:

1. Move UP to (2,1): body becomes [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]
   - Length: 4

2. Move RIGHT to (3,1): body becomes [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)]
   - Length: 4

3. Move RIGHT to (4,1): body becomes [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0)]
   - Length: 4

Wait, no—each time you move, the body adds one cell at the front and removes one at the end unless eating an apple. So from move 2 to 3:

After move 2, body is [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)]. When moving to (4,1):

- Add old head (3,1) to front: [(3,1), ..., but wait no—each move adds the previous head to the front.

Wait, let's be precise:

At each step, when you move, you add the previous head to the front of the body list and remove the last cell unless you ate an apple.

So initial position after move 2: head at (3,1), body is [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)]? Wait no—no, wait:

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:

Each time you make a move:

- new_head = current position + direction
- add old head to the front of the body list
- remove last cell if not eating apple

So initial state after moving UP:

head: (2,1)

body: [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]

Then move RIGHT to (3,1):

- old head is (2,1)
- add it to front: body becomes [(2,1)] + current body without last cell
Wait no—the process is:

When you move from position A to B:

1. Compute new_head as B.
2. If not eating, remove the last cell of body; else, add a new tail.
3. Insert old head (A) at front.

So in step 1: moving UP from (2,0) to (2,1):

- new_head = (2,1)
- old body was [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]
Wait no—initially, after the first move:

Wait, initial state before any moves:

head: (2,0)

body: [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]

After moving UP to (2,1):

- new_head = (2,1)
- old body was [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]
- since not eating, remove last cell: becomes [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]
- add old head (2,0) to front: body is [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]

Wait, no—that's the opposite. When you move from (2,0) UP to (2,1):

- new_head = (2,1)
- old head was at (2,0)
- add (2,0) to front of body
- remove last cell (since not eating)

So initial body before moving: [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]

After moving:

body becomes [ (2,0) ] + current_body[:-1] 

Which is [ (2,0) ] + [ (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) ]

So body after first move: [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]

Yes.

Then, moving from (2,1) to (3,1):

- new_head = (3,1)
- old head was (2,1)
- add (2,1) to front of body: [ (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) ]
- remove last cell (4,1): new body is [ (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) ]

Then moving from (3,1) to (4,1):

- new_head = (4,1)
- old head was (3,1)
- add (3,1) to front: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) ]
- remove last cell (4,0): new body is [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0) ]

Now, from (4,1):

Next move to (5,1):

- new_head = (5,1)
- add old head (4,1) to front: [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0) ]
- remove last cell (3,0): body becomes [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0) ]

And so on. So the body is moving forward, and each time we move right, the head moves further right without conflicting with the body.

This seems to work. Then from (5,1), (6,1), (7,1):

Each move adds a new cell at front and removes last one, keeping the body clear of the path towards the apple.

Once at (7,1), start moving UP:

From (7,1) to (7,2):

- new_head = (7,2)
- add old head (7,1) to front: [ (7,1), ... ]
- remove last cell: body becomes shorter

And continue up until reaching (7,6).

This path seems feasible.

Alternatively, if I choose to move LEFT first, the body might end up blocking the path towards the apple more quickly. For example:

First move: LEFT from (2,0) to (1,0):

- new_head = (1,0)
- old body was [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]
- add (2,0) to front: [ (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) ]
- remove last cell (4,2): body becomes [ (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) ]

Now, head is at (1,0). From here, can move UP or DOWN, but moving towards the apple would require moving right multiple times.

But since we're now at (1,0), to reach (7,6), that's 6 steps right and then up. The body might end up being in the way if not careful, especially as it reduces each time.

For example:

Move UP from (1,0) to (1,1):

- new_head = (1,1)
- add (1,0) to front: [ (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) ]
- remove last cell (4,1): body becomes [ (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) ]

Then move RIGHT to (2,1):

- new_head = (2,1)
- add old head (1,1) to front: [ (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) ]
- remove last cell (4,0): body becomes [ (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) ]

Then move RIGHT to (3,1):

- new_head = (3,1)
- add old head (2,1) to front: [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) ]
- remove last cell (3,0): body becomes [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0) ]

Then move RIGHT to (4,1):

- new_head = (4,1)
- add old head (3,1) to front: [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0) ]
- remove last cell (2,0): body becomes [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0) ]

Continuing this way, I can reach (7,1) and then move up. However, the path seems similar in terms of steps but with a slightly different starting point.

But regardless of whether we go UP or LEFT first, as long as we manage to clear the body from the path towards the apple, it should work.

Therefore, to avoid complicating things, moving UP first is probably safer and more straightforward. So the initial moves would be:

1. Move UP to (2,1)
2. Move RIGHT to (3,1)
3. Move RIGHT to (4,1)
4. Move RIGHT to (5,1)
5. Move RIGHT to (6,1)
6. Move RIGHT to (7,1)
7. Now move UP to (7,2)
8. Move UP to (7,3)
9. Move UP to (7,4)
10. Move UP to (7,5)
11. Move UP to (7,6)

That's a total of 11 moves. Let me verify if each step is collision-free.

After moving UP to (2,1):

Body: [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)]

Moving RIGHT:

From (2,1) to (3,1): safe as above.

Body becomes [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0) ]

Wait no—each time we move, the body is updated by adding old head to front and removing last cell. So after each step, the body gets shorter unless eating an apple.

So:

After moving UP: body is [ (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) ]

Then moving RIGHT:

- new_head = (3,1)
- add old head (2,1) to front: but wait, the previous head was at (2,1).

Wait no—each move's body is based on the previous state.

This might get too complicated. Alternatively, since each move reduces the body length by one (as we're not eating), after n moves, the snake will be of length 4 - n + 1? Wait, initial length was 5: head plus four body segments?

Wait no—let me recount:

Initial position before any moves:

head at (2,0)

body: [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]

So total cells: 1 (head) + 4 = 5.

After moving UP to (2,1):

- add old head (2,0) to front of body
- remove last cell (4,2)
- new body: [ (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) ]

So length remains 4.

Each move after that will keep the length at 4 because we're not eating any food (assuming no food in the way).

Wait, but moving towards an empty space—no food. So each time, the body reduces by one? Or stays the same?

No, actually, when you don't eat, you remove the last cell, so the length remains the same.

Because:

You have n cells: head + body.

When you move and don't eat, you add the old head to front (so head becomes new position), and then remove the last cell. So total cells remain the same.

Therefore, after each move, the snake's body remains at 4 cells.

So from initial length of 5 (head + 4 body) to moving UP: now head is at (2,1), body is [ (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) ] → 4 cells.

After moving RIGHT to (3,1):

- add old head (2,1) to front: new body starts with (2,1)
- remove last cell of previous body, which was (4,1): so new body is [ (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) ]

Thus, each move shifts the body forward.

So as we continue moving right towards (7,1), each step maintains the body without overlapping because the tail moves accordingly.

Once at (7,1), then start moving up:

Each UP move will add a new head position and remove the last cell. Since the body is behind, there's no collision.

Therefore, the path I outlined earlier should be safe.
</think>

The snake can safely navigate to the target location at (7,6) by following these steps:

1. Move UP to (2,1)
2. Move RIGHT to (3,1)
3. Move RIGHT to (4,1)
4. Move RIGHT to (5,1)
5. Move RIGHT to (6,1)
6. Move RIGHT to (7,1)
7. Move UP to (7,2)
8. Move UP to (7,3)
9. Move UP to (7,4)
10. Move UP to (7,5)
11. Move UP to (7,6)

This path ensures the snake avoids colliding with its body by systematically moving right and then up without any overlaps.

**Answer:**

The snake should move Up, Right four times, and then Up five times. The steps are:

Up → Right ×4 → Up ×5

\boxed{\text{U R R R R U U U U U}}
```

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 0) and whose body cells are in list format [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (7, 6). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
