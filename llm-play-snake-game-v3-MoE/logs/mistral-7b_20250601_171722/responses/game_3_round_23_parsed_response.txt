```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (3,7) and heads towards the apple at (1,7). To avoid immediate self-collision, we first move down to (3,6) since the tail does not move in this case. Then, we move left to (2,6), which keeps us from hugging the wall unnecessarily and also provides a detour away from the adjacent body segment. After that, we can move towards the apple safely."
