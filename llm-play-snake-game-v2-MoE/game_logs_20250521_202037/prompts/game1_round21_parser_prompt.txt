<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to solve this classic Snake game problem where my snake is at (8,4) facing DOWN and needs to reach the apple at (6,0). Let me break down what's given and figure out a plan.

First, let's note the initial positions. The head is at (8,4), which means x=8 and y=4 in a 10x10 grid where (0,0) is bottom-left and (9,9) is top-right. The snake's body is only at (8,5), so it's just the tail right now. The apple is at (6,0). So from the head's perspective, to get to (6,0), I need to move left twice in x-direction and up four times in y-direction.

Wait, but actually, since movement can be UP or DOWN for y, moving from 4 down would take us towards higher y values. But the apple is at y=0, which is lower than current y=4, so to get there, we need to move DOWN? Wait no, because in this coordinate system, UP increases y and DOWN decreases it. So from (8,4), moving DOWN goes to (8,3), then (8,2), (8,1), (8,0). Then to the left twice to x=6.

Wait, but that would require moving DOWN four times and LEFT two times. But we also need to consider direction changes because you can't reverse immediately. So if the snake is initially facing DOWN, it can move in any other direction except UP next step.

But first, let's check Manhattan distance: from (8,4) to (6,0), x difference of 2 left and y difference of 4 down. Since the snake starts with a body at (8,5), which is above its head by one cell. So when it moves, each move will shift the tail unless it eats the apple.

I need to plan a path that doesn't cause the snake to collide with itself or go out of bounds. Let's think step by step.

Firstly, since moving RIGHT would take us further from the goal and we can't reverse direction right away (from DOWN), our initial options are UP, LEFT, or NONE.

Wait, but wait: if the snake is facing DOWN, it means its next move will be in that direction unless it changes. But in this problem, after each move, the snake's body shifts, so the tail follows.

But actually, movement rules say:

- The snake cannot reverse direction on the first move.
- After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensuring at least one legal move exists.

Also, the required output is a list of moves that leads from (8,4) to (6,0), considering Manhattan distance as a heuristic but prioritizing safety. So perhaps I should prioritize moving towards reducing both x and y differences step by step.

Wait, no: since x needs to decrease by 2 (from 8 to 6 is left twice), and y needs to decrease from 4 to 0—four steps down.

But wait, in the example moves given earlier:

- From (1,1):
    UP → (1,2)
    DOWN → (1,0)
    RIGHT → (2,1)
    LEFT → (0,1)

So moving up increases y by 1, down decreases it. So for our snake at (8,4) facing down, the initial move can't be up.

Wait no: facing direction is independent of movement. The direction you're facing determines your next intended head position, but when you make a move, that's where the head will go, and then the body follows, shifting each segment back by one in the previous positions.

But actually, perhaps my initial thought was wrong because the snake can change direction at any point except immediately after moving. Wait no: rule 3 says "The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If the direction is "NONE", any move is allowed."

So since it's currently facing down, on the first move, it can't move up.

Wait but I need to correct myself. The initial position has head at (8,4) and current direction DOWN, so the snake's next intended movement is DOWN because that's its current direction unless changed. But wait no: "current direction" refers to the direction it is moving in each step—so perhaps after a move, if you don't change direction, but can choose to.

Wait actually, I think I'm getting confused between facing and moving. Let me clarify:

The snake moves based on its current direction. Each time you give a command (like UP), it changes direction unless the previous was NONE or same as current? No—rule 3 says cannot reverse direction, so if direction is DOWN, next move can't be UP.

So in this case, since the initial direction is DOWN, after any move that's not a change to another direction, except perhaps changing to LEFT or RIGHT.

Wait no: each command you give as part of the moves list will determine the snake's movement. So if I tell it to MOVE DOWN again, but wait—it was already moving down; can we do that?

No, because rule 3 says "The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next)".

Wait actually, perhaps each command is a step where the snake moves in some direction. So if the initial direction is DOWN, after giving MOVE DOWN again, it would be reversing? Or maybe not—if you're already facing down and decide to continue down.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me read rule 3 more carefully: "The snake **cannot** reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If the direction is "NONE", any move is allowed."

So from current direction DOWN, you can't move in the opposite direction (UP), but moving to LEFT or RIGHT or NONE is allowed.

Wait, perhaps each MOVE command changes the direction. So for example:

If the snake's head is at (8,4) facing DOWN, and I give a MOVE UP, it would reverse direction because from DOWN you can't move UP next step—so that's invalid. But if I give a MOVE LEFT or RIGHT or NONE, then the direction changes to LEFT or RIGHT.

But maybe no: perhaps each MOVE command is simply moving in a certain direction regardless of previous direction, except when reversing is not allowed.

Wait this is confusing. Let me think about it step by step.

The current state:

- Head position (8,4)
- Direction DOWN
- Body cells [(8,5)]

Apple at (6,0)

So to reach the apple, we need to move left twice and down four times from head's initial position.

But since each MOVE command sets a direction for next step, perhaps I can model this as moving in desired directions until reaching the target.

But movement rules: cannot reverse immediately after the previous direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP; else it would have to stop or adjust.

So first step:

Current position (8,4), facing DOWN.

Possible moves without reversing:

- Move LEFT: from (8,4) → (7,4)
- Move RIGHT: but that's away from target
- Move UP: no—current direction is DOWN; cannot reverse immediately.
Wait, can I move in the same direction again? Or does it only disallow reversal.

Ah! The rule says "cannot reverse direction on the first move."

So if you're moving DOWN and keep moving DOWN, that's allowed. So perhaps each MOVE command sets a new direction—unless changed by previous step.

Alternatively, maybe the movement is based on current direction unless changed.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here because of unclear rules about how directions are applied per MOVE command.

But given the problem statement says:

"Current direction: DOWN — One of "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "NONE". "

So perhaps each step, you can choose a new direction (with some restrictions) and move accordingly.

Wait, let's try to model this as choosing a sequence of directions that the snake will follow at each step. Each MOVE command is a new direction; except when current direction was NONE—meaning next can be any.

But rule 3 says cannot reverse direction on first move: so if previous direction is DOWN and you choose UP, it's invalid. But moving LEFT or RIGHT would be okay unless they're forbidden for some other reason (like same as previous).

Wait perhaps each MOVE command sets the next direction of the snake—so if current head position is at (8,4), facing DOWN:

- If I tell it to move UP, that's reversing from DOWN; so invalid.
So can't do UP.

But moving LEFT would be allowed because it's not a reversal. Similarly for RIGHT or NONE.

Wait but according to the example: from (1,1) with direction DOWN, possible moves are RIGHT, LEFT, or none?

No— in the example, they list the possible moves as LEFT, RIGHT, etc., given current position and direction.

Wait no—the MOVE command would be based on movement step. So if you're moving down, can't move up next; else it's allowed.

But perhaps each MOVE is a new desired direction for the snake to face in the next step, so after each step, direction may change unless specified as NONE.

I think I need to model this properly: when the problem says "plan a safe path," that means choosing a sequence of directions (MOVE commands) such that each command directs the snake's movement step by step. Each MOVE is a desired direction for next move; you can't reverse direction on first move.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that after each MOVE command, the snake moves in that new direction unless it was NONE (no change).

But let me clarify with an example: If current head position is (8,4), facing DOWN. The initial move cannot be UP; so possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

Wait but if you tell it to move LEFT again next step, is that allowed?

No—because the previous direction was DOWN, and now moving left would not reverse. So perhaps when moving, each MOVE command sets a new desired direction for movement, subject to current direction constraints.

But this is getting too tangled without precise rules. Maybe I should proceed with an algorithm that ensures that the snake doesn't immediately reverse its direction but can move in any other direction or NONE.

So starting at (8,4), facing DOWN:

First, we need to determine a path towards (6,0) by moving left and down, avoiding body collision.

But given that the body is only at (8,5), which is directly above head. So when the snake moves, it will shift its body accordingly.

Wait no: in this initial state, the body is [(8,5)], so when moving, the tail would be removed unless apple is eaten.

So first step:

Head is at (8,4). Body at (8,5). So current position of the snake is from x=6 to 8? Wait wait no: head is at (8,4), and body cells are [(8,5)]. So that's only one cell behind. So the rest of the body isn't visible yet because it hasn't eaten the apple.

So when moving, the next step would be:

Head moves in desired direction.

If not eating apple, tail is removed; so if new head position is (x', y'), then previous last segment is at current body positions—so for initial step, snake's body was [(8,5)], and after moving, it becomes [prev_segment]. Since no movement that would eat the apple yet, only move.

Wait perhaps in each step:

1. Head moves to new position based on direction command.
2. The tail is removed unless the apple is eaten (which adds a segment).
3. All segments are shifted: body follows previous head's path.

But without eating the apple, the snake just shifts its body backward by one—so only if it's not moving towards an empty space beyond itself.

Wait maybe another approach: each move command determines the direction for next step; but movement must be such that the new position is within grid bounds and does not cause collision with current body except when allowed (i.e., tail can be removed unless eating apple).

Given this, perhaps I should model possible moves as:

At any step, from current head position (x,y) facing direction D, and given no apple eaten yet:

- Determine all possible next directions that don't reverse immediately.
  - If previous direction was DOWN, cannot move UP.
- For each valid direction:
   - Compute new head position: add direction's delta to (x,y)
   - Check if new x and y are within grid bounds (0<=x<10, 0<=y<10).
   - Check that new head is not on any current body cells except when about to eat apple.
- If the new position is valid:
   - Add this direction as a possible next move.

So with initial state:

Current position: (8,4), facing DOWN. Body at [(8,5)].

Possible next directions without reversing from previous step (DOWN): LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

Wait but what's 'NONE'?

If previous command was 'DOWN', and you choose NONE as the new direction, then it would mean not moving? Or perhaps the snake doesn't move if given NONE. But in that case, head remains same position—unlikely to be helpful unless trying to adjust path.

But according to rule 3: "The snake **cannot** reverse direction on the first move." So if previous direction was DOWN and you give another command of any other direction (other than reversal), it's allowed.

Wait perhaps in each step, we can choose a new desired direction for movement, but subject to current direction constraints. For example:

- If last direction was UP: cannot next go DOWN.
- Any other directions are allowed unless blocked by walls or body.

But starting from initial state, with direction DOWN and no previous command—so 'NONE' is allowed as default? Or perhaps in this case, the first move can only be LEFT, RIGHT, or down if not reversing.

Wait I'm getting stuck again. Maybe to simplify: each MOVE command sets a new desired movement for the next step, considering that you cannot reverse direction from previous step's movement (e.g., if moving DOWN now and last was also DOWN—allowed; but previous direction was UP can't go DOWN).

Given initial state is facing DOWN.

Possible moves:

- Move LEFT to (7,4)
- Move RIGHT to (9,4) → x beyond 8+1=9? No, because grid is up to 9. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take x to 9, which is valid.
Wait wait: if current head is at (8,4), then adding direction right (which increases x by 1) takes it to (9,4). Is that allowed? Yes.

But since body cells are only [(8,5)], we need to check for collision after movement.

So from (8,4):

Move LEFT: new head is (7,4). Body becomes [(8,4)] → but wait no. Wait in each step:

When moving left, the tail cell at (8,5) will be removed if not eating apple. So body becomes [prev_body without last element].

But initially, the body cells are only [(8,5)], so after moving left to (7,4), new head is (7,4). Tail was at (8,5)—but since no apple eaten yet, tail is removed.

So now body becomes []? Or wait, initial body is a list of all segments behind. So if the snake's movement results in the head being at (7,4) and previous body was [(8,5)], then after moving left:

- New head is (7,4)
- The tail cell at (8,5) is removed because it wasn't moved into.
So new body cells are [ ... ]? Wait no: if the snake's current body includes all segments behind. So initial state has [(8,5)] as body, meaning that there was a segment at (8,5). When moving left to (7,4), since we're not eating apple, tail is removed.

So after first move LEFT:

- New head: (7,4)
- Body cells now are [from prior body minus new head's previous position? Or just the segments behind.]

Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe in this setup, the snake has a certain length, determined by how many times it has moved forward without eating apple.

But since we don't know if the snake will eat apple yet or not, perhaps each MOVE command is moving one cell at a time without growing.

So initial body cells are [(8,5)] → meaning that before any movement, there's a single segment behind. So when you move to (7,4), that becomes new head; and since it didn't eat the apple yet, tail is removed—so now body is empty except for this step? Or perhaps each time, the snake just moves forward without growing unless eating apple.

Wait no: from example given in problem statement:

Snake moves when command is given. If moving into a cell with food (apple), it grows; else, it doesn't grow and loses tail segment.

But initial state has body cells [(8,5)] → which suggests that the snake's head was at (8,4) before movement—it moved to (7,4). So in this case, when moving left from (8,4) to (7,4), since apple is not eaten yet, the tail segment at (8,5) is removed. Therefore, new body cells would be empty except for new head position.

Wait that seems off because without a tail, it's unclear how the snake can move further unless another movement command is given with proper direction and no collision.

Perhaps each MOVE command moves the head in desired direction, regardless of current body—so if you choose to move LEFT, your new head is (7,4); then, since apple not eaten, previous tail cell at (8,5) is removed. So snake's body now is only [(8,5), ... ]? No.

Wait maybe this model is getting too complicated for me without clear rules on how the body updates after each move.

Alternative approach: treat the snake as a single segment moving in desired direction, with no body—i.e., only tracking head position and ignoring the rest. But that's probably not correct because problem mentions that apple leads to growth (i.e., adding new segments), so maybe the snake is considered as multiple cells connected together.

But given time constraints, perhaps I should proceed by modeling each MOVE command as a step in which:

- Head moves in desired direction.
- Check if new head is within grid and not overlapping any body except for eating apple.

So let's model each possible step with this simplified approach, focusing on getting from (8,4) to (6,0):

Current position: (8,4), facing DOWN. Body at [(8,5)].

Possible moves:

1. Move LEFT: new head (7,4). Check if within grid—yes. Check for collision: does (7,4) collide with any body cells? Currently only (8,5)—so no. So allowed.
2. Move RIGHT: new head at (9,4). Within grid? Yes. No collision yet. Allowed.
3. Move UP: can't because previous direction was DOWN; reverses.
4. Move DOWN: same as current direction, but according to rule 3, you cannot reverse immediately if last command was DOWN.

Wait no—if the last command was DOWN and now giving another DOWN is allowed? Or since it's not reversing from a different direction.

Ah! Maybe only UP can't be done after DOWN; other directions are fine. So in this case:

From facing DOWN, you can do LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE (no movement).

Wait but if current direction was something else, like RIGHT, then next step could do any except LEFT?

No—the rule is about the previous command's direction.

So assuming that each MOVE command sets new desired direction for movement. If previous command resulted in moving DOWN, next step cannot move UP; other directions are allowed unless blocked by walls or body.

Therefore:

First step from (8,4), facing DOWN—possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, NONE.

Let's choose the best possible path towards apple at (6,0). So prefer to move left and down as much as needed.

But initial position is such that moving UP would be invalid. But we're already moving in DOWN direction; so can't reverse immediately.

Wait no—previous command was none, current facing is DOWN—so next step can choose any except UP.

So perhaps first step:

Move LEFT to (7,4).

Now head at (7,4), body cells were [(8,5)] before move. After moving left, new head is (7,4). Since no apple eaten yet, tail segment from previous position (the snake's last moved cell) is removed.

Wait but how do we track the rest of the body?

This seems complicated; perhaps for this problem, it's sufficient to model each step as moving the head in a direction without considering the entire body—only checking if new head is valid and not colliding with any existing body segments except when eating apple.

But given that initial state has only one cell behind (8,5), after first move left:

- New head: (7,4)
- Body cells are [(8,5)] → but now since we moved to (7,4), the previous position was (8,5). Did it collide? No.

Wait no—because when moving from (8,4) to (7,4), body segments that were in front would shift. Wait maybe I should model the snake as a line of cells where each step moves one cell forward without overlapping with any part of itself except for apple.

But perhaps given time constraints, let's proceed with an algorithm:

1. Determine all possible directions that can be taken from current position and direction.
2. For each direction:
   a. Compute new head position.
   b. Check if new head is within grid bounds.
   c. Check if new head collides with any existing body cells (without considering apple).
3. Among these valid moves, choose the one that brings us closer to target.

So first step:

From (8,4), facing DOWN; possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, NONE.

Check each direction's validity and impact on path towards (6,0):

- Move LEFT: new head at (7,4). From here, need to reach apple. So from (7,4) can move left again or down.
  - Next steps would be similar but with updated position.

But I'm not sure if moving LEFT is the best step because perhaps another direction brings us closer in fewer steps.

Alternatively:

From (8,4), could we choose a different initial direction?

Wait wait no—current facing is DOWN. So can't move UP; so first move must be LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

If moving LEFT takes head to (7,4); moving RIGHT would take head to (9,4). Which is farther leftwards? Neither is more towards the target than the other in x-direction; but perhaps after that step, moving down would help.

But let's see:

After first move LEFT to (7,4), current direction remains DOWN. So next possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

Wait no—if you chose to move LEFT as first command, your new head is at (7,4); and the previous direction was DOWN—so for next step:

- You cannot reverse; so can't move UP if last movement wasn't UP. Wait wait, after moving LEFT from facing DOWN, which is allowed.

But what's the effect on current direction? Since you moved in a different direction than your last command. So now, previous command was MOVE left, new heading is DOWN. So next step cannot reverse to right or something else—wait I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each move as setting a desired direction, and movement can be any direction except immediate reversal.

So if current direction is D, next step can't be opposite(D). Otherwise allowed.

But in the initial state:

Current head at (8,4), facing DOWN. So previous command was NONE? Or undefined?

Perhaps it's better to think that each move sets a new desired direction, and movement is made in that direction unless restricted by rules.

Given this uncertainty, perhaps I can try a BFS approach—trying all possible valid moves from current state until reaching target or detecting if path exists.

But for now, given time constraints, maybe the minimal path would involve moving left as much as needed to reach x=6, then down towards y=0. So let's see:

From (8,4):

- Move LEFT: (7,4)
- Then move LEFT again: (6,4) → which is still at y=4.
Wait apple is at (6,0); so need to get from (6,4) down to (6,0).

So steps would be:

1. Move LEFT twice to reach x=6, y=4.

2. Then move DOWN four times to reach y=0.

Total moves: 6.

But let's check if this path is blocked by the snake's own body.

At each step, after moving left once from (8,4) → new head at (7,4); no collision with any body except perhaps itself. Then move left again→ (6,4). Then down four steps:

(6,4) → (6,3) → (6,2) → (6,1) → (6,0).

Each step needs to ensure that new head is not colliding with previous positions.

But wait—after first left move: body cells are [(8,5)] and new head at (7,4). Then second left move takes us to (6,4); so body becomes [from prior: (8,5), after moving left twice → new body would be [(7,4), (8,5)]? Or maybe the snake is modeled as a single segment moving.

This part is getting too unclear for me. Given time constraints, perhaps it's better to accept that minimal number of moves from (8,4)→(6,0) is 6 steps: two lefts and four downs.

But wait another approach: the Manhattan distance between head position and apple is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. From (8,4) to (6,0): |8-6| + |4-0|= 2+4=6. So minimal steps without considering snake's body would be 6.

But with the constraint that we can't reverse direction from previous step immediately, perhaps it's possible in more than 6 steps if required movement is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move diagonally through down-right or left-down directions, but since each step only changes one coordinate at a time (as per LEFT and DOWN commands), no diagonal moves are allowed.

Thus, the minimal number of steps would be 2 lefts and 4 downs: total 6 steps. But we have to check if snake's body blocks any path.

Wait in this case, initial position is head=8,4; tail=8,5 (since body cells=[(8,5)]).

When moving left from 8,4 → new head at 7,4; no collision as previous body was [8,5], which isn't overlapping with 7,4. Then move left again to 6,4—no problem.

Now the snake's body is [(8,5), (7,4)]? Or something else?

Wait perhaps each MOVE command moves the head one cell and shifts the rest of the body behind it. So initial state:

Head:8,4; Body: [8,5].

After first move LEFT → Head:7,4; Body becomes [8,4], since previous head was 8,4.

Then second move LEFT → Head:6,4; Body becomes [7,4]. Now no collision with any body except the initial segment.

Wait but wait, when you move left again from 7,4 (head), your new position is 6,4. The previous head was at 7,4, so in moving to 6,4, do I have a collision with any existing body cells? Current body after second left is [8,5,7,4], but the snake's current body would be [(8,5), (7,4)] since each step shifts.

Wait no—probably not. Each MOVE command causes the head to move one cell and removes the previous tail position if not eating apple.

So from initial state:

- Head:8,4; Body: [8,5].

Move LEFT → Head:7,4. Since we didn't eat apple, tail (8,5) is removed? Or does it stay?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this without clear rules on how the snake's body updates.

Given time constraints and to avoid getting stuck in modeling details, maybe the answer is that it takes 6 steps: moving left twice then down four times.

But let me think again:

- Current position: (8,4), facing DOWN. To reach (6,0):

Firstly, move LEFT as much as possible until x=6, which requires two steps (from 8→7→6).

Then from y=4 to y=0 needs four downward steps.

Total steps:2+4=6.

But is there a possibility that some of these moves are blocked by the snake's body?

Wait when moving left twice:

1. First move LEFT → head at (7,4); previous body was [(8,5)].

   No collision; proceed.

2. Second move LEFT→ head at (6,4); now body is [7,4], since tail cell moved from 8,4 to 7,4? Or wait:

Wait initial position: Head=8,4; Body=[8,5].

Move LEFT → new head=7,4; old head=8,4. Since no apple eaten yet, the body is updated by removing the last element (old tail was at 8,5). So after first move, body becomes [8,5] without any change? Or does it shift?

This seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps each MOVE command just moves the head in desired direction and shifts the rest of the snake behind. So when moving LEFT from head=8,4 to 7,4:

- The new head is (7,4)
- The body cells are updated by adding a new cell at the end corresponding to previous head position.

Wait no—maybe after each move, the entire snake shifts forward, so that's why it's difficult.

But without precise rules on how the body updates, perhaps I should proceed with assuming that each MOVE command only moves the head one cell in desired direction and doesn't affect other parts of the body except for checking collision at new position.

Thus, moving left twice to x=6 is safe because initial body was behind, so no overlap. Then four steps down from (6,4) are also safe as long as we don't have any segments blocking the path in y-direction.

Given that the initial snake's body after two lefts would be [8,5,7,4] or similar—wait perhaps with each move, the head moves and the tail is removed unless apple is eaten. But since no apple is eaten until reaching it, maybe the snake's body just shifts forward without changing.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving down from (6,4), the current path doesn't have any obstacles because the only body segment is at (8,5) initially but after moving left twice and then down four times, there's no collision.

Thus, I think it's possible to reach the apple in 6 steps: two lefts and four downs.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine a path for a snake from its current position (8,4) facing downward towards an apple located at (6,0). The snake can move in four directions—left, right, up, or down—but cannot reverse direction immediately after a move. Additionally, the snake's body must not overlap itself except when moving into the apple.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (8,4) facing downward with its body segments given as [(8,5)]. This indicates that behind it is a segment from which it can move.
2. **Determine Moves**: From each position, we consider moves in all possible directions except for the immediate reverse of the previous direction. The valid moves are checked to ensure they do not collide with any existing body segments (except when moving into the apple).
3. **Path Calculation**: We aim to reach the apple at (6,0) by moving left as much as needed and then down towards the target. This approach minimizes the number of steps required.

### Solution Code
```python
def find_min_moves():
    from collections import deque

    # Initial state: position (8,4), facing DOWN, body is [(8,5)]
    current_pos = (8, 4)
    apple_pos = (6, 0)
    directions = ['left', 'right', 'down']  # since after initial down, can't move up next

    visited = set()
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((current_pos[0], current_pos[1], False))
    moves = []

    while queue:
        x, y, is_down = queue.popleft()

        if (x == apple_pos[0] and y == apple_pos[1]):
            print("Number of moves required:", len(moves))
            return

        for direction in directions:
            new_x, new_y = None, None
            if direction == 'left':
                new_x = x - 1
                new_y = y
            elif direction == 'right':
                new_x = x + 1

### Explanation
1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at (8,4) with a body segment at (8,5). This indicates that the head can move left into this position.
2. **Direction Handling**: The snake can move left or right to change its x-coordinate and down to decrease its y-coordinate towards the apple.
3. **Avoid Collisions**: Each potential move is checked against existing body segments to avoid collisions except when moving into the apple.
4. **Path Calculation**: By moving left twice and then down four times, we reach the apple in a minimal number of steps without violating any movement constraints.

This approach ensures that the snake reaches the apple efficiently while adhering to all given rules.

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the head now at (8, 4) to eat the apple at (6, 0).

RULES:
- Text at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 is less important than the text at the end.
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
