# Evolutionary Algorithms for Snake Game AI

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing evolutionary algorithms, specifically genetic algorithms, in the Snake Game AI project.

## 🧬 **Overview**

Evolutionary algorithms represent a family of optimization techniques inspired by biological evolution. In the Snake Game AI context, these algorithms evolve populations of agents to discover optimal game-playing strategies through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.

## 🎯 **Genetic Algorithm Approaches**

### **1. With DEAP Framework**
- **Library**: Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP)
- **Advantages**: 
  - Mature, well-tested framework
  - Built-in genetic operators
  - Multi-objective optimization support
  - Extensive documentation and examples
- **Use Case**: Rapid prototyping and research-oriented implementations

### **2. Custom Implementation (Hand-coded)**
- **Approach**: Built from scratch without external frameworks
- **Advantages**:
  - Full control over genetic operations
  - Snake Game-specific optimizations
  - Educational value for understanding GA mechanics
  - Lightweight implementation
- **Use Case**: Production deployments and educational demonstrations

## 🏗️ **Architecture Design**

### For v0.03, we should add the dashboard folder.
