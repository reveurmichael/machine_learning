========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move RIGHT 4 times (to reach x=5) and DOWN 5 times (to reach y=1). Starting with RIGHT avoids reversing direction and moves toward the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent RIGHT moves continue aligning horizontally. Once at x=5, moving DOWN aligns vertically toward the apple. Each move checks for collisions with the body, which shifts safely as the snake progresses. After reaching the apple, a DOWN move is still legal, ensuring no immediate trapping."
