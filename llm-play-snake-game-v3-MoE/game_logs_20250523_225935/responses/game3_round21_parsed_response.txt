{"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT", "UP"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (5, 7) and needs to move in a way that avoids collisions while eventually reaching the apple at (2, 4). First, we move RIGHT to get one cell closer to the apple horizontally. Then, since there is no viable option moving directly UP or DOWN due to the current position of the snake's body, we decide to go LEFT to avoid collision and position ourselves for a future movement towards the apple. Finally, we move UP twice to reach the apple."}
