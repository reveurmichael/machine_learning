========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is currently at (5,5) and needs to reach the apple at (1,1). I need to plan a safe path for the snake to move without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds. 

First, let's understand the current state. The head is at (5,5), and the direction is NONE, meaning any initial move is allowed except reversing if there were a previous direction, but since it's NONE, all directions are possible. However, the movement rules say that once a direction is chosen, the next move can't be the opposite.

The apple is at (1,1). The Manhattan distance between (5,5) and (1,1) is 8, so we need a path that covers this distance efficiently while avoiding collisions with the body. Since the initial body is empty, we don't have to worry about body segments blocking the way right now.

I think the optimal path would involve moving left four times and down four times. However, I need to ensure that each move doesn't reverse direction in a way that causes immediate collision or traps the snake.

Let me plan the moves:

1. Start by moving LEFT to reduce the x-coordinate. From (5,5) to (4,5).
2. Then, continue moving LEFT to (3,5), then (2,5), and finally (1,5). Now at (1,5), we need to move down four times.

Wait, but after each left move, the body grows if it's eating an apple. Oh wait, no, the apple is at (1,1), so when moving down from (1,5) to (1,4), etc., I have to ensure that the snake doesn't collide with its own body.

Wait, but in this case, the initial body is empty, so after each move, the body will just follow. So as long as the head moves towards the apple without reversing direction, it should be fine.

Let me outline the moves:

1. LEFT: (5,5) → (4,5)
2. LEFT: (4,5) → (3,5)
3. LEFT: (3,5) → (2,5)
4. LEFT: (2,5) → (1,5)
5. DOWN: (1,5) → (1,4)
6. DOWN: (1,4) → (1,3)
7. DOWN: (1,3) → (1,2)
8. DOWN: (1,2) → (1,1)

This path seems straightforward. Each move is a left followed by downs, ensuring the snake doesn't reverse direction and grows as it moves towards the apple.

Wait, but after each LEFT move, the direction changes from NONE to LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT. Since we're only moving LEFT four times and then DOWN four times without reversing, this should be safe.

I also need to check if after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move left. After reaching (1,1), the body will have grown, but since the moves end here, it's okay as the problem doesn't require further steps.

So, the sequence of moves would be four LEFTs and then four DOWNs.

{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move left four times to reach column 1, then move down four times to reach the apple at (1,1). This path avoids collisions and ensures each move is safe."
}
```
