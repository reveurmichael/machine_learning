========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": [],
"reasoning": "The snake's body forms a vertical line from (4,2) to (4,9), blocking the leftward path to the apple at (3,3). Any attempt to move left into (3,3) would collide with the body segment at (4,3), which is not the tail and remains in place during normal movement. No safe path exists to reach the apple without collision."
