========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from (5,5) to eat the apple at (9,4). The grid is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right.

First, the head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (9,4). So, I need to calculate the direction and number of moves required. Looking at the x-coordinate: 5 to 9 means moving right four times. For the y-coordinate: 5 to 4 means moving down once. But since movement in one direction affects the other, I have to plan a path that doesn't cause collisions with the body or walls.

The current direction is "NONE", so any first move is allowed except for reversing, but since it's NONE, all directions are possible. However, the next moves can't be opposite of the previous direction.

Let me consider the shortest path: moving right four times and down once. But I need to make sure that each step doesn't cause the head to collide with any body segments or go out of bounds.

The snake's current body is empty, so it's just the head. So initially, there are no body segments in the way. That makes things easier for the first few moves.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5).
2. Then RIGHT again to (7,5).
3. Another RIGHT to (8,5).
4. And another RIGHT to (9,5).
5. Now, I need to move DOWN once to reach (9,4).

Wait, but moving down from (9,5) would take me to (9,4), which is the apple's position. So that's perfect.

So the moves would be: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN.

I should check for any possible collisions. Since there are no body segments except the head, and each move is within bounds, this seems safe. Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so the new body will include the old positions, but since we're moving towards the apple without any blocking body parts initially, it's okay.

Another thing to consider: After eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn. But since we've reached the apple in five moves, the next move after that would depend on where the tail is. However, as per the rules, when the snake eats the apple, the body grows without removing the tail, so the next move should still have space.

So I think this path works.
</think>

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves right four times to align horizontally with the apple and then down once to reach it, avoiding any collisions as there are no body segments present initially."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (9, 4). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
