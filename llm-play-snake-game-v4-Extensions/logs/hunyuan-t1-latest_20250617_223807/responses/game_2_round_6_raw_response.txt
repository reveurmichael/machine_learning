{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move up 4 times to reach y=5 (from y=1) and right once to reach x=8 (from x=7). Moving up first avoids collision with the body (initially along x=8-9, y=1-4) and stays within bounds. After each up move, the body shifts up, leaving the path clear. The final right move reaches the apple at (8,5) without colliding with the body, which is now positioned along x=7-8, y=1-5."
