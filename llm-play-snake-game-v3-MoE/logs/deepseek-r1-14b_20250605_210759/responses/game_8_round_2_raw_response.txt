========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (9,7) to eat the apple at (1,2). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (9,7), and the body has one segment at (9,6). The direction is currently "UP", which means if I choose a direction that's not DOWN (since you can't reverse), I have to pick UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, since the current direction is UP, next move can't be DOWN.

First, let me visualize the grid. The head is near the top-right corner, and the apple is at (1,2), which is towards the bottom-left of the grid. So, the snake needs to move left and down quite a bit.

But wait, how? Because from (9,7), moving left would take it to (8,7). But let me think about possible paths.

Since the snake can't reverse direction on the first move, if it's currently going UP, the next move can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see what each option does.

If I choose LEFT: new head would be at (8,7). Then, in the body update, since we're not eating an apple yet, the tail (9,6) will move to (9,5). So after moving left, the snake's body becomes [(9,7), (9,6)] and the head is at (8,7).

Wait, but the body segments are behind the head. Oh right, the body list provided is from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So in this case, it's just [(9,6)], which is one segment.

Now, the next step: after moving left, we check for collisions. The new head at (8,7) should not collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it moves. But since the body will shift, the tail is about to move from (9,6) to somewhere else, so as long as the new head isn't on a cell that's occupied by a body segment that won't be moving away.

Wait, in this case, after moving left, the body becomes [(9,7), (9,6)], and then if we don't eat an apple, the tail is removed. So actually, when checking for collision, the new head must not collide with any body segments except possibly the tail's current position, which will be vacated.

But in this case, after moving left to (8,7), the body list before movement was [(9,6)]. The new head is at (8,7), which isn't part of the body yet. So that should be safe.

So, choosing LEFT seems okay for the first move.

Now, from there, I need to plan a path towards the apple. Let's see: after moving left once, the head is at (8,7). Now, perhaps we can continue moving left towards the bottom-left, but wait, the apple is at (1,2), which is much lower and more to the left.

Alternatively, maybe I should move down first. But since the current direction is UP, if I chose LEFT as the next move, that's fine. Then, in subsequent moves, can I change directions?

Wait, no. The movement rules say you can't reverse. So once I choose a direction, the next move can't be the opposite. For example, if I go LEFT first, then my current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT.

But let me think: after moving LEFT to (8,7), the new head is at (8,7). The body list becomes [(9,7)], because we added the old head and removed the tail (since we didn't eat an apple yet).

Wait, no. Wait, when you move, you compute the new head, check for collision, then update the body.

So initial state:

Head: (9,7)

Body: [(9,6)]

Direction: UP

After moving LEFT:

new_head = (8,7). Check if it's valid. It is.

Then, insert old head into body list, so body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6) ].

Since new_head != apple, we remove the tail. So body becomes [(9,7)].

Wait no: wait, in step 3a, you insert the old head into the front of the BODY list. So after moving LEFT:

new_head is (8,7).

BODY before movement was [(9,6)], but during movement update:

- Insert old head (9,7) at front → body becomes [(9,7), (9,6)].

Then, since new_head != apple position, remove tail: so body becomes [ (9,7) ].

Wait no: after inserting the old head into the front of BODY, which was [(9,6)], it becomes [(9,7), (9,6)]. Then, if not eating apple, remove the last element. So body is now [ (9,7) ].

But then the new HEAD is (8,7). So the full snake is [ (8,7), (9,7) ].

Wait that doesn't make sense because the body was [(9,6)] before movement. After inserting old head, it's [ (9,7), (9,6) ], then remove tail, so it becomes [ (9,7) ]. So the snake is now HEAD at (8,7), and body at (9,7).

But that can't be right because the body would have to be adjacent to the head. Wait, no: the body was [(9,6)], which is behind the head at (9,7). After moving LEFT to (8,7), inserting the old head makes the body [ (9,7) ].

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me recheck the movement rules:

Step 3a: Insert old head into front of BODY list → becomes BODY1.

So initial BODY is [(9,6)]. After inserting old_head (9,7), the new BODY is [(9,7), (9,6)].

Then, step 3c: if not eating apple, remove last element → so BODY becomes [(9,7)].

But that can't be right because then the body would be at (9,7), which is adjacent to the new head at (8,7). Yes, because x differs by 1. So it's okay.

So after moving LEFT once, the snake's body is [ (9,7) ].

Now, next move: direction is now LEFT. Because previous direction was UP, but we moved LEFT, so current direction becomes LEFT.

Wait no: the movement rules say that the direction is updated to the chosen direction. So if I choose LEFT as the next move, then after moving, the current direction is LEFT.

So for the second move, from (8,7), current direction is LEFT, and can't choose RIGHT next.

But wait, in this case, we moved LEFT once, so the new direction is LEFT, meaning the next move cannot be RIGHT.

Hmm. But I'm not sure about that. Wait, no: each move's direction becomes the new current direction, except when choosing NONE? Or is "NONE" only for initial moves?

Wait, according to movement rules:

If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed.

But in our case, initial direction is UP, so after moving LEFT, the new direction is LEFT.

So next move can't be RIGHT.

Now, from (8,7), I need to decide where to go. Let me consider possible directions: UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

Wait, no: current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT. So options are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

But moving LEFT again would take us to (7,7). But perhaps that's not the best path towards the apple at (1,2).

Alternatively, maybe I should start moving down towards the apple.

Wait, but from (8,7), if I move DOWN, that's y decreasing by 1: new head at (8,6). Let me check if that's possible.

So, movement to DOWN:

new_head = (8,6).

Check collision: current body is [(9,7)], and the new head is at (8,6). Are any of these positions in the body except possibly the tail?

In this case, after moving LEFT once, the body is [ (9,7) ], so the tail is (9,7), but when we move DOWN, the new head is (8,6).

So collision check: does (8,6) coincide with any body cell except the tail's current position? The body is [(9,7)], which is different from (8,6). So no collision.

Then, update body:

Insert old head (8,7) into front → body becomes [ (8,7), (9,7) ].

Since new_head != apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (8,7) ].

So after moving DOWN, the snake is at HEAD (8,6), and body [(8,7)].

But wait, no: when you move to (8,6), the body before movement was [(9,7)], then inserting old head gives [ (8,7), (9,7) ], but since we didn't eat apple, remove last → [ (8,7) ].

Wait, that can't be right. Because the new head is at (8,6), and the body is at (8,7). But those are adjacent, so it's okay.

Now, the snake has moved to (8,6), and the next move would have current direction DOWN.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe moving further left isn't the best idea. Perhaps I should start moving down more.

Wait, but let me think of a different approach: perhaps the first move should be DOWN instead of LEFT.

Because from (9,7), if I move DOWN to (9,6), which is where the body is currently. Wait no: because the body is [(9,6)], and the head is at (9,7). So moving DOWN would take the head to (9,6), which is the same as the body's position. That would cause a collision.

Wait, yes! Because when you move down from (9,7) with direction DOWN, new_head is (9,6). But before movement, the body was [(9,6)], so in collision check, does the new head collide with any body segments except possibly the tail?

In this case, the new head would be at (9,6), which is exactly where the body's only segment is. So that would cause a collision and thus invalid move.

So moving DOWN from (9,7) is not allowed in the first step because it would collide with the body.

Therefore, first move can't be DOWN; must be LEFT or UP? Wait, no: current direction is UP, so can choose UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. But let's see:

If I choose UP as the next move, new_head would be (9,8). Let me check if that's within bounds. The grid is 1-based, right? Or 0-based?

Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify, but assuming it's 1-based, (9,7) is near the top-right corner. So moving UP would take us beyond y=7 to y=8, which may be outside the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is size 9x7 or something else? Hmm, not sure. But if we assume that y ranges from 1 to N, and current head is at (9,7), then moving UP would take it to (9,8). So if the grid's maximum y is 7, that's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps y can go up to higher numbers, but let's say for safety, moving UP might not be allowed because it could cause out-of-bounds. Alternatively, perhaps it's allowed as long as the coordinates are within 1-9 or whatever.

But regardless, from (9,7), moving UP may not be a good idea if it's near the top. So maybe better to move LEFT first.

So back to plan: first move is LEFT to (8,7). Then next move could be DOWN or further LEFT.

Let me try moving DOWN after that.

From (8,7), direction is LEFT.

If I choose DOWN as next move:

new_head = (8,6).

Check collision with body [ (9,7) ]: no, because (8,6) != (9,7). So safe.

Update body: insert old head (8,7) → [ (8,7), (9,7) ]. Remove last element if not eating apple → [ (8,7) ].

So now, snake is at (8,6), with body segment at (8,7).

Next move: direction is DOWN. So can't choose UP next.

From (8,6), possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT? Wait no: current direction is DOWN, so next move can be any except UP.

Wait, movement rules say you can't reverse direction immediately after a move. So if current direction is DOWN, the next move cannot be UP.

So from (8,6), I can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

Hmm, but moving further down towards the apple may make sense.

But let's see: moving DOWN again to (8,5).

Check collision: body is [ (8,7) ], so new head at (8,5). No collision. Proceed.

Insert old head into body → [ (8,6), (8,7) ]. Remove last element → [ (8,6) ].

Now, snake is at (8,5), with body segment at (8,6).

This seems tedious, but perhaps the best way is to move all the way down and then left.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is needed. Let me think about the path from (9,7) to (1,2). The shortest path would be moving left 8 times and down 5 times, but that's too simplistic without considering the snake's body.

Wait, no: perhaps I should plan a route that allows the snake to grow as it moves towards the apple. But since we're not eating any apples yet, the snake is just moving around with its current length of 2 (head + one segment).

So after first move LEFT: head at (8,7), body at (9,7). Then, perhaps move DOWN twice.

Wait, no: let me try to plan step by step:

Move 1: LEFT → (8,7), body becomes [ (9,7) ]

Move 2: DOWN → (8,6), body [ (8,7) ]

Move 3: DOWN → (8,5), body [ (8,6) ]

And so on until reaching y=2.

Then, perhaps start moving left towards x=1.

But each time we move down or left, the snake's head moves and the body follows, but only keeping one segment behind.

Wait, no: after each move where you don't eat an apple, the tail is removed. So in this case, since we're not eating any apples, the snake remains at length 2 (head + one body). Unless I can find a way to grow it by moving over its own path, but without an apple, that's impossible.

Wait, no: unless you move into a position where your old head is now part of the body. Wait, let me think: when you move, you insert the old head into the front of the body list, then remove the last element if not eating.

So each time you move without eating an apple, the body's length remains the same as before.

Wait no:

If initial length is 2 (head + 1), after moving once without eating, the body becomes [old_head], so length is 2 again? Or does it stay at 1?

Wait, in movement step 3a: insert old head into front of BODY. So if body was empty before, it would become [old_head]. But in our case, initial body after move is [(9,7)], then next moves may vary.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Move LEFT: head (8,7), body [(9,7)]

2. Move DOWN: head (8,6), body [ (8,7) ]

3. Move DOWN: head (8,5), body [ (8,6) ]

4. Move DOWN: head (8,4), body [ (8,5) ]

5. Move DOWN: head (8,3), body [ (8,4) ]

6. Move DOWN: head (8,2), body [ (8,3) ]

Now at x=8, y=2.

Then, need to move left all the way to x=1.

But each time moving LEFT:

7. Move LEFT: head (7,2), body [ (8,2) ]

8. Move LEFT: head (6,2), body [ (7,2) ]

9. Move LEFT: head (5,2), body [ (6,2) ]

10. Move LEFT: head (4,2), body [ (5,2) ]

11. Move LEFT: head (3,2), body [ (4,2) ]

12. Move LEFT: head (2,2), body [ (3,2) ]

13. Move LEFT: head (1,2), which is the apple.

Wait, but after moving to (1,2), we need to eat the apple. So let's see:

When moving into (1,2), new_head is at (1,2). Check collision with body segments except tail.

Body before movement was [ (3,2) ]? Wait no: in step 6, when head was at (8,2), after that move, the body is [ (8,3) ]?

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me recount:

After move 6: head is (8,2), body is [(8,3)].

Then, moving LEFT to (7,2):

Insert old_head (8,2) into body → [ (8,2), (8,3) ]

Since new_head != apple, remove last element → [ (8,2) ]

So now, head at (7,2), body [(8,2)].

Then move LEFT again: to (6,2).

Insert old_head (7,2) into body → [ (7,2), (8,2) ]

Remove tail → [ (7,2) ]

Head is now (6,2), body [(7,2)]

Continuing this way:

Move 7: head (5,2), body [ (6,2) ]

Move 8: head (4,2), body [ (5,2) ]

Move 9: head (3,2), body [ (4,2) ]

Move 10: head (2,2), body [ (3,2) ]

Move 11: head (1,2), which is the apple.

Now, when moving to (1,2), new_head is at apple's position. So during this move:

- Compute new_head = (1,2).

- Check for collision with body segments except tail. The body before movement was [ (3,2) ]? Wait no: after move 9, head is at (3,2), body [(4,2)].

Wait I'm getting lost in tracking the body positions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that each move without eating an apple keeps the body length as it is. So from step 1 onwards, the snake is moving with a fixed body size of 2 (head + one segment).

Therefore, when moving towards (1,2), as long as the path doesn't cause the head to collide with its own body, it's possible.

But this seems complicated. Maybe an alternative approach would be better: find a path where after each move, the snake can reach the apple without colliding with itself and allowing growth by eating the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps I should outline the steps as:

1. Move LEFT to (8,7)

2. Move DOWN repeatedly until y=2.

3. Then move LEFT all the way to x=1.

But each time moving down and left without growing would require careful planning to avoid self-collision.

Wait, when moving down from (9,7) to (9,6), we saw earlier that it's impossible because body is at (9,6). So perhaps better to move LEFT first.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the snake grow by eating an apple in the process. But in this problem statement, the snake starts without any food; it just needs to move towards the apple and then eat it.

So the plan would be:

- Move in such a way that the head reaches (1,2) without colliding with its own body.

Assuming that's possible, once at (1,2), the snake can eat the apple, grow, and solve the problem.

Therefore, one possible sequence is as follows:

Move 1: LEFT → (8,7)

Body becomes [(9,7)]

Move 2: DOWN → (8,6)

Body becomes [(8,7)]

Move 3: DOWN → (8,5)

Body becomes [(8,6)]

...

Continue moving down until y=2.

At that point, move left towards x=1.

Each time moving without collision.

Finally, move into (1,2) where the apple is located. At this point, since it's a valid move (no self-collision), the snake can eat the apple, thus solving the problem.

So, summarizing, the path would involve:

- Moving LEFT once to get out of the initial position.

- Then moving DOWN repeatedly to reach y=2.

- Then moving LEFT all the way to x=1.

This requires a total of 7 moves down (from y=7 to y=2) and 8 moves left (from x=9 to x=1), but considering the starting move, it's 1 + 5 + 8 = 14 steps? Or perhaps more precisely, moving from y=7 to y=2 is 5 steps down (since y decreases by 1 each time).

Wait, no: from y=7 to y=6 is step 2, then to y=5 step3, etc., so to get from y=7 to y=2 requires 5 moves down.

Then, moving left from x=8 to x=1 requires 7 moves (from 8 to 7 to ... to 1).

But wait, initial position after move 1 is x=8. So from x=8 to x=1 is 7 steps left.

So total moves: 1 (left) +5 (down) +7 (left) =13 moves.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscounting because each down move happens in sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact number of moves isn't as important as ensuring that the path doesn't collide with itself and reaches the apple.

Therefore, a possible solution is:

Move 1: LEFT → (8,7)

Move 2: DOWN → (8,6)

Move 3: DOWN → (8,5)

Move 4: DOWN → (8,4)

Move 5: DOWN → (8,3)

Move 6: DOWN → (8,2)

Now at (8,2). Then:

Move 7: LEFT → (7,2)

Move 8: LEFT → (6,2)

Move 9: LEFT → (5,2)

Move 10: LEFT → (4,2)

Move 11: LEFT → (3,2)

Move 12: LEFT → (2,2)

Move 13: LEFT → (1,2) ← apple location

Now, at this point, the snake's head is at (1,2), which is where the apple is. Assuming that it's allowed to move here without colliding with its own body.

After moving to (1,2), the snake can eat the apple, grow, and thus solve the problem.

Therefore, the sequence of moves would be LEFT, DOWN five times, then LEFT seven times.
</think>

The solution involves a series of moves where the snake first navigates down and then leftward to reach the apple's position without colliding with its own body. The step-by-step moves are as follows:

1. Move LEFT to (8,7)
2. Move DOWN five times to (8,2)
3. Move LEFT seven times to (1,2)

By following these steps, the snake reaches the apple at (1,2) and can consume it, successfully solving the problem.
