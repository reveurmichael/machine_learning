343
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,469

and then we'll step in and just trace

344
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
and then we'll step in and just trace
 

345
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,830
and then we'll step in and just trace
that same curve

346
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
that same curve
 

347
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,670

on both sides
 

359
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,749
on both sides
and then we'll round out the bottom of

360
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
and then we'll round out the bottom of
 

361
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,670
and then we'll round out the bottom of
the feet starting from the heel and

up the top of the foot so we're going to

370
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
up the top of the foot so we're going to
 

371
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,390
up the top of the foot so we're going to
curve up

511
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,790

and out

512
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
and out
 

513
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,030
and out
and do the opposite on the outside

514
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040

 

515
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,630

now let's draw the top of the arm going

516
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
now let's draw the top of the arm going
 

517
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,269
now let's draw the top of the arm going
in behind the ball so we land at the top

518
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
in behind the ball so we land at the top
 

519
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,310
in behind the ball so we land at the top
angle down and out

520
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
angle down and out
 

521
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,150
angle down and out
go out with a straight line in behind

522
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
go out with a straight line in behind

525
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,310

and then we draw the tip of the thumb

526
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
and then we draw the tip of the thumb
 

527
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,150
and then we draw the tip of the thumb
and the fingers to start the very top

and move to the side

534
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
and move to the side
 

535
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,740
and move to the side
and draw three small half circles
