# Reinforcement Learning in Snake Game AI Project

This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing and working with reinforcement learning agents in the Snake Game AI project across different extension versions.

## 🎯 **Reinforcement Learning Overview**

The project implements multiple RL algorithms to demonstrate different approaches to learning optimal Snake game strategies:

- **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**: Value-based learning with experience replay and target networks
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Policy gradient method with clipped surrogate objective
- **A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)**: Distributed training with actor-critic architecture
- **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)**: Off-policy method with maximum entropy objective

### **Why Multiple RL Algorithms?**
- **Comparison Studies**: Different algorithms excel in different scenarios
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates various RL paradigms and techniques
- **Performance Analysis**: Benchmarking different approaches on Snake game
- **Algorithm Evolution**: Shows progression from basic to advanced RL methods

### **Best Practices for RL in Snake Game**

1. **State Representation**: Use multi-channel spatial representation for better feature 
   learning (TODO: I am not sure about this. Double check. We have already csv-schema-1.md and 
   csv-schema-2.md, but this is for csv output files, not for RL, so it might be different.)
2. **Reward Design**: Balance immediate rewards with long-term strategy incentives
3. **Exploration**: Use appropriate exploration strategies (epsilon-greedy, noise injection)
4. **Training Stability**: Employ techniques like target networks, gradient clipping, and experience replay
