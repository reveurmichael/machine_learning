Check attached md files.

Now, make python files in extensions/heuristics-v0.04 work. Most importantly:
- Keep the behaviour of the agents/algorithms unchanged.
- We might be using now a lot of functions in the folder "extensions/common/"
- For this moment, no need for streamlit app.py , no need for replay mode no need for pygame no need for web no need for gui. 
- The VITAL goal, the GRAND GOAL, is to generate jsonl files . Of course, we will be generating game_N.json and summary.json files as well, just like for Task0. This generating game_N.json and summary.json files  functionality should already be very well provided by core folder or game manager. 

Keep in mind: 








Python files in "extensions/common/" folder are expected to be generic and reusable across all extensions, and not restrictive. Generally, they should not be too much ML/DL/RL specific. No need for logging into *.log files; we rely on print statements and files in the "logs/" folder, instead of *.log files.
According to the rules set in `standalone.md`, we should not have such python files in the "extensions/common/" folder as : 
ml_constants.py, 
metrics_utils.py, 
test_utils.py, 
factory_utils.py, 
model_registry.py,
training_defaults.py, 
extension_utils.py
model_validator.py
extension_validator.py
config_validator.py
validation_types.py
I have already removed those files from the "extensions/common/" folder. 
But it is good to have:
dataset_formats.py,
dataset_utils.py (maybe need to make it a little bit simpler? or maybe not), 
csv_schema_utils.py, 
path_utils.py (VERY GOOD, I LIKE IT), 
path_validator.py (overly complex, not good, simplify or remove it), 
validation_rules.py (#TODO the content seems to overlap a lot with dataset_formats.py; please check.)
path_constants.py (VERY GOOD, I LIKE IT), 
For other python files, it's up to you to decide.
Also, after second thoughts, I think there is no real need to force agents to use factory pattern, though it's up to extensions themselves to decide. 
## Bottom line
It's good to have things in the "extensions/common/" folder that are generic and reusable across all extensions, not restrictive, and really simple or relatively simple. Even for thing like validators , validate a little bit, and that's it. Don't be too restrictive, don't be too complex, don't be too ML/DL/RL specific, don't be too harsh.
