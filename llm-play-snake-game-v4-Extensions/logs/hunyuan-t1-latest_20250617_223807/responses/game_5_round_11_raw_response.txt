========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (8,0) with a body extending up to (8,4) and left to (2,4). To reach the apple at (7,6), the path must navigate left and up while avoiding body collisions. Moving LEFT first avoids downward/out-of-bounds risks, then UP moves incrementally up the left side, detouring around the body at (7,4) by shifting left, then continuing UP to (6,6) before moving RIGHT to the apple. This path ensures no collisions and leaves space for a legal next move after eating."
