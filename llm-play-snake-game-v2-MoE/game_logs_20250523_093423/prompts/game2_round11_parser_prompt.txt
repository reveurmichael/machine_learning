BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>We are given snake head at (5,0). Current direction: RIGHT, meaning snake is moving right. Snake's body cells: [(4,0)] so that means the snake occupies positions (4,0) along with head (5,0), but it's not clear if that's tail? Actually they said "body cells: [(4,0)]" which are segments besides head, meaning previous cell is left of head. Apple at (7,7). Grid is 10x10.

We need safe path planning. We need to output JSON with moves array and reasoning field explanation.

The objective: Plan a safe path for the snake from head pos (5,0) to apple pos (7,7), avoiding collisions, ensuring that we can leave legal move after eating the apple.

We must follow rules:
- Allowed moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
- Current direction is RIGHT. Must not reverse direction on first move if current direction is RIGHT then cannot go left? Wait check reversal rule: "The snake cannot reverse direction." That means from current direction "RIGHT", you cannot choose the opposite direction which is LEFT on the next immediate move. But what about subsequent moves? They said "snake cannot reverse direction". But also note that if apple is behind current direction, then we need to detour.

Now check potential path: The snake's head is at (5,0) and its body occupies (4, 0). It is moving to the right. The snake will continue moving in the same direction if no input changes? But since the move planning is our responsibility, maybe we are allowed to plan any moves for the first turn as long as we obey the non reversing rule from the current direction.

Now check potential collisions: The snake's body occupies (4,0). So if the snake remains moving right, new head becomes (6, 0) and then next step would remove tail. But careful: after a move the head position will be new, and the old head becomes part of the body. The tail is removed unless apple eaten. So we must plan path that doesn't cause collision with our own body.

Let's check possible moves:

- Starting at (5,0) moving right:
  * Option 1: Continue going right.
  But then what? Let's simulate a few steps if I continue right until reaching column coordinate 7? Possibly not safe because the snake's body is currently (4,0). After each move, the snake "shifts", meaning head becomes new position and old head becomes body part. But careful: after first move, the tail would be removed. Let's simulate:

At initial state:
Snake: Head = (5,0), Body = [(4,0)].

If we choose move RIGHT, then new head is (6, 0). Then snake's previous head (5,0) becomes body and tail is removed (because apple not eaten). So new snake positions become: Head: (6,0), Body: (5,0) (with body cell from (4,0) being tail? Wait need to check details)
Actually the game update rules: New head = head + direction. Then head becomes a body segment. Tail is removed unless apple eaten.
So new snake positions after move right:
Head: (6, 0)
Body: Old head (5,0) and also old body remains? Actually we must see order of shifting.

I think it's easier to simulate the snake as list of segments from head to tail. The given state is just one segment for body, but then simulation after move:

- Before move: snake = [Head: (5,0), Body: [(4,0)]]. So snake occupies positions [ (5,0), (4,0) ] with order head first.
Then if we choose RIGHT:
   New head becomes (6, 0)
   The previous head becomes body segment. And then the tail is removed (which is last element of snake list).
But careful: Our current "body" list doesn't include tail removal? Let's simulate:

Initial snake state:
Position order: [Head=(5,0), BodySegment1=(4,0)].

After moving RIGHT:
   New head = (6, 0)
   Then add previous head to body. So temporary list becomes [New Head (6,0), Old head (5,0), then tail removal]
But tail is removed from the last element of current snake? Actually how do we update? The typical snake algorithm: newSnake[0] = newHead, and for i in range(len(oldSnake)-1): newSnake[i+1]=oldSnake[i]. So initial list [ (5,0), (4,0) ] becomes after move:
   newSnake[0]=(6,0)
   newSnake[1]=(5,0) from old snake head
   and tail is dropped. But then what happened to the old body cell? It was not moved? Actually check:
Wait, I need to recall typical snake game movement algorithm: 
Given a list snake = [head, second segment, third segment,...] and tail is last element.
When moving, newSnake[0]= head+direction
For i from 1 to len(snake)-1, newSnake[i] = snake[i-1].
Tail removed because newSnake[-1] is not added. 
So initial snake: [ (5,0), (4,0) ].
After move RIGHT:
   new head = (6, 0)
   then newSnake[1]= old snake[0]=(5,0).
Then the tail of the previous state was (4,0) and is dropped because i from 2 does not exist since len(snake)=2. 
So final snake becomes [ (6,0), (5,0) ].

So after one move right, snake = head: (6,0); body segment: (5,0). And note that old position of tail (4,0) is removed from game state.
Now check collisions with body segments. That path might be safe if the apple is not reached.

But we need to get to apple at (7,7). Let's compute Manhattan distances:
Initial head = (5,0), apple = (7,7).
Difference: dx=2, dy=7. So the net required move difference in x: 2 right moves needed. And y: 7 up moves needed. 
The sum of moves is 9 if we go straight? But also need to avoid collisions.

We must check potential path collisions with body segments. The snake's body currently is at (4,0) then after a move becomes (5,0). So if the snake goes right from (5,0) to (6,0), then next move maybe up or something. We can plan route. Let me consider possible safe paths:

The apple is at (7,7). The snake's head is near bottom row at y=0.
We need a path that avoids collision with body segments which are following behind and might block.

Since the snake has only two segments currently, it's relatively simple: head at (5,0) then tail (4,0) initially. After one move right from (5,0), snake becomes [ (6,0), (5,0) ]. 
Let me simulate possible path if we decide to go up after moving right:
Consider potential route: If we continue going right first, then up.
From head (5,0) and current direction is RIGHT. But check reversal rule for first move: cannot reverse current direction so you cannot choose LEFT on the next move because that would be opposite of RIGHT.

Plan route: Option A: Move RIGHT from (5,0) to (6,0). That is allowed because direction remains same? Not sure if that's considered "reverse" or not. The rule said "must not reverse direction on first move." But staying in the same direction isn't reversing.
Then from new head (6,0), next possible moves: can be RIGHT, UP, DOWN; but cannot choose LEFT because it would be reversal of current moving direction? Wait rule 3: "The snake cannot reverse direction" means if you're currently going RIGHT, then going left is forbidden. But what about second move? Actually re-read instructions: "if the direction is 'NONE', any move is allowed." And then constraint says "must not reverse direction on the first move". It might imply that the immediate next move must not be in the opposite direction of the current movement vector (so if you're moving RIGHT, the first move you choose cannot be LEFT). But after that, does reversal become allowed? It's ambiguous. The instruction says: "If the direction is 'NONE', any move is allowed." And then constraint says "Must not reverse direction on the first move". I interpret that as meaning that from initial state with a given current direction, you are not allowed to choose its opposite.
Thus for first move (the one we're planning now), if current is RIGHT, you cannot choose LEFT. So possible moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT itself.

Now think about optimal path to apple:
We want to reach (7,7) with net displacement 2 right and 7 up. But must also check collisions.

Let's consider potential route that goes around the snake's body. The snake's body is currently behind us. Let's simulate a few moves manually:

Option 1: 
Move 1: RIGHT from (5,0) to (6,0). Then snake becomes [ (6,0), (5,0) ].
Now apple = (7,7).

From head (6,0): possible next move? We want eventually to move up. But note that we can't reverse direction if current direction is still RIGHT? But does the new direction become current direction after each move? I assume yes, because it's game state update. So now new direction becomes "RIGHT" as well.
So at (6,0) with snake currently moving right, allowed moves: UP, DOWN, and continue RIGHT are allowed, but NOT LEFT.
Now if we choose RIGHT from (6,0), then head will go to (7, 0). That seems to be going in the direction of apple's x coordinate. But maybe that is good because it covers dx difference quickly.
Let’s consider: Option A1:
Move 2: FROM (6,0) with current direction still RIGHT; choose RIGHT to move from (6,0) to (7,0).
But then after move, snake becomes [ head=(7,0), body=(6,0) ] and tail removed.
Then apple is at (7,7). Now the snake's x coordinate equals apple's x coordinate. And we need to go up 7 units from y=0 to y=7. But wait: if we are at (7,0) and snake moving right, then next move cannot be left because that would reverse direction? But going upward is allowed though.
From (7,0), with current direction still RIGHT, allowed moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT are allowed but not LEFT? Because current direction is RIGHT. So from (7,0), if we choose UP, it's fine.

Then sequence:
Move 3: FROM (7,0) with snake moving right, choose UP to go to (7,1). Then new snake becomes [ head=(7,1), body = (7,0)].
Now apple is at (7,7). And our net required movement from here is 6 up moves needed.

But need to check collisions: The snake's body is currently at (7,0) and it will shift after move. But that is safe as long as we don't run into our own tail which is not blocking our way because the apple is in a different region.
At (7,1), allowed moves with current direction now being UP? Wait careful: When snake changes direction, does it update to new direction immediately? I believe yes. The game update "Current direction" updates to the chosen move's direction after each turn. So then at (7,0) if we choose UP, the new snake will be moving upward.
So then next moves:
Move 4: From head=(7,1), with current direction now being UP, choose UP to go to (7,2). Snake becomes [head=(7,2), body=(7,1)] etc. And so on.

We want to reach apple at (7,7) from (7,?) but wait careful: We already reached x=7 coordinate after move 2 and then moved up. So if we simply go up repeatedly, eventually the head will become (7,7)? Let's see:
At Move 3, snake was at (7,0) moving right; then move 4: UP from (7,1) to (7,2) etc. But note that current direction is now changed to whatever we choose.
So Option A1 plan:

Move sequence:
Step 1: RIGHT: head (5,0) -> (6,0). New snake becomes [ (6,0), (5,0) ].
Step 2: RIGHT: from (6,0) with direction right -> (7,0). New snake becomes [ (7,0), (6,0) ]
Step 3: Now at (7,0) moving right; but we want to turn upward. But turning up is allowed because rule "must not reverse" doesn't apply for turning up if previous direction was right? The reversal rule only applies to the opposite direction of current movement vector. So from RIGHT, LEFT is forbidden, but UP is fine.
Step 3: UP: from (7,0) -> (7,1). New snake becomes [ (7,1), (7,0)] and new direction becomes UP.
Step 4: From head = (7,1) moving up; choose UP to go to (7,2).
Step 5: FROM (7,2) -> (7,3)
Step 6: (7,3) -> (7,4)
Step 7: (7,4) -> (7,5)
Step 8: (7,5) -> (7,6)
Step 9: (7,6) -> (7,7)

Now check collisions:
After step1: snake = [(6,0), (5,0)].
After step2: snake = [(7,0), (6,0)]
After turning up at step3: head becomes (7,1); body remains (7,0). That is fine. Then each subsequent move upward: 
At step4, new snake becomes: [head=(7,2), body=(7,1)].
Step5: [ (7,3), (7,2) ]
Step6: [ (7,4), (7,3)]
Step7: [ (7,5), (7,4)]
Step8: [ (7,6), (7,5)]
Step9: [ (7,7), (7,6)].
So at final step the head reaches (7,7) which is apple position. 
But we need to consider if any move would result in immediate collision with our tail? For instance, after move 2, snake is at (7,0) and body was (6,0). When turning up from (7,0), will the new head be adjacent to body segments that might cause collisions later? Let's check: After move2, snake = [(7,0), (6,0)]. If we choose UP from (7,0), then the new head becomes (7,1) and old head moves into the tail position. There is no collision with (7,0)? But wait, what if turning up results in potential trap? We need to check: 
At step3, when moving up from (7,0) to (7,1), is that cell already occupied by any snake body segment? The snake positions are currently (7,0) and (6,0). So no collision with (7,1).
Then after move3, the snake becomes [head=(7,1), body=(7,0)].
At step4: moving up from (7,1) to (7,2). The snake positions then become [head=(7,2), body=(7,1)]. No collision because (7,1) is now in tail, but that's not a problem.
So seems safe.

But wait, check net displacement:
We need net +2 right and +7 up. But with our moves: Right twice, then Up eight times? Let's recalc: Actually sequence A1:
Step 1: (5,0) -> (6,0): + (1,0)
Step 2: (6,0) -> (7,0): + (1,0). Total so far = (+2,0).
Then step3 onward up moves. But we need total displacement to be (2,7) from starting position? Because apple at (7,7) and start (5,0) means difference is (2,7)? Wait 7 - 0 equals 7, but our net required y movement should be +7, not +8. Let's recalc: Start at (5,0), apple at (7,7). Difference in x: 2, difference in y: 7.
Our plan with two rights gives displacement of (2,0). Then if we move up, after one move up from (7,0) to (7,1), that is + (0,1); then up to (7,2): total up movement becomes +2 relative, but wait, let's recompute carefully:
After step2: head = (7,0). Then if we go up 7 times, that yields final position (7,7) because starting at y=0 and adding 7 equals 7. So you need exactly 7 up moves after reaching x=7.
So sequence would be: 
Step1: Right: head from (5,0)->(6,0)
Step2: Right: head from (6,0)->(7,0)
Then Up repeatedly:
Step3: Up: (7,0)->(7,1)
Step4: Up: (7,1)->(7,2)
Step5: Up: (7,2)->(7,3)
Step6: Up: (7,3)->(7,4)
Step7: Up: (7,4)->(7,5)
Step8: Up: (7,5)->(7,6)
Step9: Up: (7,6)->(7,7)

That totals 2 rights and 7 ups. That gives net displacement of (2,7), which is exactly the needed difference from starting at (5,0)? Wait (5+2=7, 0+7=7). Yes.

So Option A1 yields a valid sequence: [RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP]. But check constraint: "must not reverse direction on the first move." The first move is from current state with direction given. And initial state's current direction is RIGHT, so we are allowed to continue RIGHT because that's not reversing.

But wait, does the plan have any potential collision pitfalls?
Let's simulate snake body positions along Option A1 carefully:
Initial snake: head = (5,0), body = (4,0).
After move 1 (RIGHT): head becomes (6,0); new snake becomes [(6,0), (5,0)]. The cell (5,0) is now occupied by the tail. 
Now check potential collisions in upcoming moves:
At move 2, from (6,0), if we continue right to (7,0). Then snake becomes: head=(7,0), body=(6,0).
Now turn up at move 3. When turning up from (7,0) to (7,1), check collision with snake bodies: Body segments are (7,0) and then the tail of previous state? Let's simulate carefully:
Before move 3, snake = [(7,0), (6,0)]. The cell that will be occupied by new head is (7,1). None of these equals (7,1), so it's safe.
After move 3, snake becomes: head=(7,1), body=(7,0).
Then move 4: from (7,1) upward to (7,2): new snake = [(7,2), (7,1)]. No collision because previous tail is (7,1) and new head is (7,2). 
And so on. All subsequent moves are simply moving up one cell at a time in the same column with no interference since the snake's body will be trailing below. At each move, the new head becomes exactly one row above the old head and tail moves down. There's no possibility of collision because we're not turning around to re-encounter our body segments, as long as there is no wrap-around or anything.
Also check boundaries: The snake is going up from y=0 to y=7 along column 7 in a board presumably bigger than that (we assume it's an unbounded board or board large enough).
So Option A1 seems safe.

But wait, we must also consider the possibility of collision if we try to move straight right first. But in our sequence, we did two rights then up. And check reversal rule on second move: after turn 2, current direction is still RIGHT; but then turning up from (7,0) would be allowed because it's not opposite of RIGHT.
Now, however, the instructions require that "the route must avoid collisions with its own body." Our planned path doesn't cross itself because the snake occupies a contiguous line along row 0 or row 1? Let's check: After move2, snake is at (7,0) and then after move3, head becomes (7,1). The old head (7,0) is behind. There's no collision because the new head is not equal to any body part.
However, we must also consider if turning direction might create a situation where the next cell in the path was occupied by the snake's tail from previous move? Let’s check: At move 3, new head (7,1) - does it coincide with any body part? The previous snake positions are (7,0) and (6,0). So no collision.

What about move 4? From (7,1), moving up to (7,2): the old head becomes (7,1) and then tail moves. No conflict.
So Option A1 is safe as long as board boundaries are not an issue. We assume board is sufficiently large.

Thus a possible sequence of moves: "RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP". That would be 9 moves in total: 2 rights and then 7 ups.
But wait check net displacement calculation:
From (5,0) going right twice gets to (7,0). Then up 7 times gets to (7,7). Yes.

But then we must also obey "must not reverse direction on the first move." We did that because our first move was RIGHT which is same as current direction.

However, could there be a possibility of a shorter sequence? Let's check alternative: What if you go up and then right? But careful with reversal rules: starting direction is RIGHT so you can't choose LEFT. Up is allowed though.
Let’s consider Option B:
Move 1: from (5,0) to (5,1) by moving UP. Is that allowed? Yes, because it's not reversing the current direction which is RIGHT. But wait, "reverse" means if current direction is RIGHT then left is reversed. So up and down are not reverse of right. So move UP is allowed.
Then if you go up again to (5,2), etc. But then how do you get to x=7 eventually? We want to finish at (7,7). Starting from (5,0) going straight up will get you to (5,7) after 7 ups. Then you need to move right twice: but wait, that's two rights in a row if your current direction is up then turning right means turning clockwise? But would that be allowed? It might create collisions though.
Let's simulate Option B:
Initial snake at (5,0) with body = (4,0). 
Move 1: UP from (5,0) -> (5,1); new snake becomes [(5,1), (5,0)].
Move 2: continue up: from (5,1)->(5,2); snake becomes [(5,2),(5,1)].
Then do this until move 7: eventually head at (5,7) with body chain along column 5.
Now to reach x=7, we need two rights. 
But then, if current direction is up, turning right means new direction is RIGHT. But that might be a problem because initial state's direction was RIGHT and the snake's tail might cause collisions?
Let's simulate further:
After move 7: head = (5,7); body is chain from (5,0) to (5,6) along column 5.
Then Move 8: turn right: from (5,7)->(6,7); new snake becomes [(6,7), (5,7), (5,6), ...].
Move 9: continue right: from (6,7)->(7,7); new snake becomes [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7)...].
Check collisions: after move 8, the new head is at (6,7) and body occupies (5,7),(5,6), ... etc. No conflict.
But we must check if turning right is allowed given reversal rule on first move? The first move was UP which does not reverse from RIGHT, so it's allowed.

So Option B yields a sequence: [UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT]. That is 7 ups and then 2 rights. But wait check net displacement:
Start (5,0) -> after 7 ups get to (5,7); then two rights get to (7,7). Yes.

Which sequence is preferable? The problem doesn't mention any cost function like fewer moves or something; it just asks "determine the route". Possibly the shortest route that avoids collision with its own body. Let's compute lengths: Option A has 9 moves total, Option B also 9 moves. Which one is valid though? But wait, which one might cause collisions?
Let's analyze potential self-collisions for Option B:
Initial snake chain: at start: head=(5,0), tail = (4,0). If we move up repeatedly, the snake becomes a vertical line along x=5 from y=0 to y=some. But wait, after moving up repeatedly, will there be any possibility of collision? The snake's body is basically contiguous with no gaps because it just occupies adjacent cells. So after 7 moves upward, the snake's positions are: head=(5,7), then (5,6), (5,5), ... , tail at (5,0). Then if you turn right, new head becomes (6,7) and body shifts so that previous head becomes (5,7) etc. But is there a collision risk? Check the cell to the right of the current head: when turning from up to right, the snake occupies cells along column 5 in row 5-7. The new head (6,7) might be adjacent to some part of its body if that was already occupied by something? Let's simulate Option B more carefully:
After move 1: positions: (5,1), (5,0). 
Move 2: from (5,1)->(5,2); snake = [(5,2), (5,1), (5,0)].
Move 3: head becomes (5,3); snake = [(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0)].
Move 4: head becomes (5,4); snake = [(5,4),(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0)].
Move 5: head becomes (5,5); snake = [(5,5),(5,4),(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0)].
Move 6: head becomes (5,6); snake = [(5,6),(5,5),(5,4),(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0)].
Move 7: head becomes (5,7); snake = [(5,7),(5,6),(5,5),(5,4),(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0)].

Now Move 8: turning right from up means new direction RIGHT. But careful: The rule "must not reverse its current direction" applies to the first move of any route? It says "the snake's route must avoid collisions with its own body and reverse moves are not allowed on the first move." That might be interpreted as: On the very first move, you cannot immediately go in the opposite direction of the snake's current movement. The phrase "reverse moves are not allowed on the first move" might mean that if your initial movement is to the right, then the immediate next move cannot be left (which would be a reversal), but it doesn't restrict subsequent turns from reversing? But maybe it means no reverse at all in the route. Let me re-read: "the snake's body does not allow for any reverse moves on the first move." Possibly it means that the snake can only continue forward or turn, but cannot immediately go backwards relative to its current direction on the very first move. However, the wording is ambiguous.

Actually, let’s read carefully: "The snake must avoid collisions with its own body" and "reverse moves are not allowed on the first move." That suggests that if you're moving in a certain direction initially, you cannot immediately reverse that direction as your next move. It doesn't necessarily mean you can't reverse later; but I think it's likely they intended to disallow any 180-degree turns at all.

But Option B: The snake starts with current movement right? Actually initial state: "given its current orientation and location", perhaps the snake is currently moving right because that is the only direction possible if not specified. But then you have a choice: either continue straight or turn perpendicular. And reverse (left, which would be opposite of right) is disallowed on the first move.

Given that, Option A is safe because it's continuing forward twice and then turning up. Option B is also safe because starting with UP is not reversing relative to RIGHT? Wait, but if the snake is currently moving right, then going straight up is a turn left relative to right (because right rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise is up) but that might be allowed if it's not reverse. But wait, what does "reverse" mean in this context? Reverse would be turning around 180 degrees from its current direction. So if initial direction is RIGHT, then the disallowed move on the first step is LEFT. It doesn't say you can't turn left later; it only says no reverse moves are allowed on the first move. However, I'm not entirely sure if that means that the snake's first move cannot be in a direction opposite to its current movement (which would be left), or does it mean that any reversing of direction is disallowed? The wording "reverse moves" seems ambiguous.

Let’s assume that only immediate reversal on the first move is disallowed. That is, if you're moving right initially, your first move cannot be left; but you could potentially go up as a first move because that's not exactly reverse (which would be left). But wait, what is considered "reverse"? If the snake is oriented horizontally to the right, then its head is facing east. A reversal would mean turning 180 degrees, which is west. So going north or south are allowed, but going west is disallowed on the first move because that's exactly opposite of east.
Therefore Option B: starting with UP as the first move from (5,0) to (5,1) is allowed since it's not west; it's north. But then after moving up repeatedly, you'll eventually have to turn right. That might be a reversal relative to your last direction? No, turning right means from north to east which is allowed if reversal was only disallowed on the first move.
But does that cause collisions with its body? Let's simulate Option B carefully for collisions:
- Initially snake: head=(5,0), tail=(4,0).
- Move 1 (UP): new head becomes (5,1). Snake positions become: [(5,1), (5,0)].
- Move 2 (UP): new head becomes (5,2). Positions: [(5,2),(5,1),(5,0)].
- Move 3 (UP): new head becomes (5,3). Positions: [(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0)].
- ...
- Continue until move 7 (UP): positions become: head=(5,7), then (5,6), ..., tail at (5,0).
Now check if any collisions: the snake's body occupies all cells with x=5 and y from 0 to 7. The new head after move 8 is going to be turning right (east) from north, so new head becomes (6,7). But then note that (5,7) is now the second cell in the snake's body. Is (6,7) adjacent to any part of its body? It might cause a collision if the snake's body occupies (6,7), but it doesn't because all cells are x=5.
- Move 8: turn right from north gives east, so head becomes (6,7). Positions update: new snake = [(6,7), (5,7), (5,6), ... (5,0)].
Now check for collisions. The new head is at (6,7) and its body occupies all cells along column 5 from row 0 to 7 except (6,7) itself obviously. There's no collision because (6,7) is not in the snake's old positions.
- Move 9: continue right from east gives head becomes (7,7). Positions update: new snake = [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), ...].
Check for collisions: the snake occupies (7,7)? It doesn't already exist because previous head was (6,7) and tail is (5,7) etc. So no collision.
Thus Option B is valid.

Between Option A and Option B, which one might be intended? They are both 9 moves long. But wait, what's the minimal number of moves? The Manhattan distance from start to target: start = (5,0), target = (7,7). Manhattan distance = |7-5| + |7-0| = 2+7=9. So the shortest route requires 9 moves if there were no obstacles. But here we have the snake's body as an obstacle that might block some cells. Let's check: Option A: moving right, then right, then up, ... which route exactly? Wait, Option A as I described earlier was: (5,0) to (6,0) to (7,0), then (7,1) to (7,2) to ... eventually (7,7). That path has 9 moves. But wait, count moves: from (5,0) to (6,0): move right; (6,0) to (7,0): move right; then (7,0) to (7,1): up; then (7,1) to (7,2): up; ... up until (7,7). That would be 2 + 7 = 9 moves. Check collisions: Initially snake's body occupies (4,0) which is behind the head if moving right? But after move 1, positions become: head=(6,0), tail remains at (5,0)? Wait, let’s simulate Option A carefully:
Initial: head=(5,0), tail=(4,0). 
Move 1: going right from (5,0) to (6,0). New snake: [(6,0), (5,0)].
Move 2: go right from (6,0) to (7,0). Now snake becomes [(7,0),(6,0),(5,0)]. 
Now move 3: going up from (7,0) to (7,1). Then snake becomes [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Move 4: up to (7,2): positions = [(7,2),(7,1),(7,0),(6,0),(5,0)]
...
Eventually, move 9: up from (7,6) to (7,7). 
Check collisions along the path:
- When moving right initially, the snake's head moves into (6,0), and tail is at (4,0). No conflict.
- Then (7,0) is free because tail is (5,0) but not interfering.
- Then going up: (7,1): Check if it collides with any body part. The snake's body occupies (7,0),(6,0),(5,0). (7,1) is fine.
- Continue similarly; should be safe because the snake's body is following behind and there's no immediate reversal collisions.
So Option A works.

Now, which one did we want? The problem doesn't specify a preference for fewer turns or something. It just asks "determine the route" perhaps meaning that we have to choose a specific route that satisfies these conditions. Possibly the intended solution is to use BFS on a grid with state including snake's body positions and orientation. However, the question is phrased as if it is from an interview or puzzle context.

Given typical puzzles like this one, they often want the shortest path from start to goal while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body. And the provided answer might be the sequence of moves (like R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U if Option A) or some variant that doesn't reverse direction.

Let me re-read the problem statement: "Given a 2D grid game where a snake is moving, determine a route from point A to B avoiding collisions with its own body and considering that reverse moves are not allowed on the first move." It might be a typical puzzle for path planning in state space search.

Wait, but I must consider one more detail: The snake's body is given as an initial list of positions. For example, maybe the snake has head at (5,0) and tail at (4,0)? But then the phrase "its own body" means that if the snake moves into any cell occupied by any segment except for when it's moving forward to consume food? Usually in Snake game, you can move into your own body if you are going to eat food but not usually. But I think here we assume no self-collision allowed.

We must also consider that the snake's route is subject to constraints: The snake cannot reverse direction immediately on its first move; so if it's moving east initially, it cannot move west as its first step.
Given that the initial state isn't fully described (but likely head position at (5,0) and tail at (4,0)?)

Wait, perhaps I should assume a typical scenario: Snake's head is at (5,0), snake is oriented to the right. The goal is at (7,7). And we want a safe path that doesn't cause collisions with the snake's body.

We can do a BFS search on state space where state = (head position, orientation, positions of snake segments) and moves allowed are: continue straight, turn left, or turn right? But then reverse is disallowed on first move but maybe later turns might be allowed if not reversing. The puzzle states "reverse moves are not allowed on the first move." It might mean that you can't immediately reverse direction relative to your current orientation in the very first move, as that would cause immediate collision with the tail.

I should also consider that snake's body will shift after each move. In such problems, typically a BFS is used where state includes the positions of all segments (with head and then tail segments). And when moving, the new head is computed and then the last segment is dropped (unless food is eaten which is not relevant here).
I might try to compute one possible route manually.

Let’s denote moves as: R for right, U for up, L for left, D for down. The snake's initial orientation I assume is to the right because its head at (5,0) and tail at (4,0). So initial state:
Head = (5,0), Tail = (4,0).

We want to reach target: (7,7).

Option A: R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U. Let's simulate Option A step by step:

Initial positions: 
Segment indices from head index 0 to tail last:
H0=(5,0), H1=(4,0).

Move 1 (R): 
New head = (6,0). Remove tail (which is now at (4,0) gets removed? Actually, when moving forward, new snake positions become: new head becomes (6,0); old segments shift: previous head becomes second segment; and last tail is dropped).
So after move 1:
Snake positions: [ (6,0), (5,0) ].
Check collision: None. 
Move 2 (R): 
New head = (7,0). Now snake becomes: [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
No collision? Check cell (7,0) is not in old positions.
Move 3 (U):
New head = (7,1); snake becomes: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Collision check: none of the segments are at (7,1).
Move 4 (U):
New head = (7,2); snake becomes: [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
No collision?
Move 5 (U):
New head = (7,3); snake becomes: [(7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
No collision.
Move 6 (U):
New head = (7,4); snake becomes: [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
No collision.
Move 7 (U):
New head = (7,5); snake becomes: [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
No collision.
Move 8 (U):
New head = (7,6); snake becomes: [(7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
No collision.
Move 9 (U):
New head = (7,7); snake becomes: [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
No collision, and we reached the target. So Option A is valid.

But wait: Are there any constraints regarding not reversing? In Option A, none of the moves are reversals. And the first move is R which is allowed because snake was initially oriented to right so reverse would be L but that's not chosen.
So Option A is a candidate.

Now check Option B: U, then R, etc. But then it might run into issues with self-collision? Let's see if any alternative route exists:
- The Manhattan distance suggests 9 moves are needed.
- In Option A, we did exactly 9 moves.

I need to consider if the snake can move in such a way that its own body blocks some grid cells. We must check intermediate positions relative to the snake's body from previous moves.
In Option A simulation, at each move we computed new head and dropped tail. And it never collided because the snake always moves one cell forward.

I have to be careful: When moving right initially, the snake is effectively turning its "body" behind it. But note that if the snake were to make a turn, sometimes you could get collisions with your own body if not careful.
But Option A is straightforward: Move east two cells then north 7 cells. That route goes along the bottom row from (5,0) -> (6,0)->(7,0), then straight up column 7 from y=1 to y=7.

But wait, check collision when turning upward at (7,0): The snake's body currently occupies: head is at (7,0), second segment at (6,0), third segment at (5,0). So the cell above (7,0) is (7,1); that doesn't conflict with any of these. But then after moving up to (7,1), what's the snake's body? It becomes: head = (7,1), then (7,0) becomes second segment, (6,0) becomes third, (5,0) remains.
Then turning upward from (7,1) is fine. However, I must check potential collisions when the snake's tail might be adjacent to the new head if it has not moved enough times?
Let me simulate move by move:
- Move 3: After two rights, snake positions are [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0)]. Then moving up from (7,0) gives head at (7,1). That cell is not in old positions because they were at x=7,y=0; x=6,y=0; x=5,y=0.
- After move 3, snake becomes: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)]. Then move 4: moving up from head (7,1) gives new head at (7,2). Check if any collision with tail? The old positions are now [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)] and new head is (7,2) so no conflict.
So Option A seems safe.

I think the simplest answer would be: 
"From starting point at (5,0) moving right twice then up seven times." But wait, that's 9 moves total? Actually, it's right-right-up-up-up-up-up-up-up which is 2 + 7 = 9 moves. But target is (7,7), so distance in x is 2 and y is 7.

But wait: Is (7,0) safe for the snake to pass through? We must consider that if the snake's tail might eventually catch up?
Let’s simulate more carefully:

State representation:
We have positions as a list from head to tail. The snake moves by adding new head and removing tail.
Initial state: 
Head: (5, 0), Tail: (4, 0).

After each move:
- Move "R": New head = (head.x+1, head.y). Drop tail.

So Option A route: R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U.
Simulate:

State0: [(5,0), (4,0)].
Move1(R): new head = (6, 0); remove tail => state becomes: [(6,0), (5,0)]. Check collision? (6,0) is not in previous list.
Move2(R): from (6,0), new head = (7,0); then state becomes: [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Move3(U): from (7,0), new head = (7, 1); state becomes: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)]. 
No collision because none of these equal (7,1).
Move4(U): from (7,1) -> (7,2). State becomes: [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Move5(U): new head = (7,3); state becomes: [(7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Move6(U): new head = (7,4); state becomes: [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Move7(U): new head = (7,5); state becomes: [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Move8(U): new head = (7,6); state becomes: [(7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Move9(U): new head = (7,7); state becomes: [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].
Final state's head is at target.

So Option A route works.

I must check if any other constraints exist: "reverse moves not allowed on the first move" means that from initial orientation right, reverse would be left which we are not using. So it's fine.

The answer may simply be: The snake should travel east (R) twice then north (U) seven times to get from point A (5,0) to point B (7,7).

However, is there any possibility that the snake's body might block movement on Option A? Let's check potential pitfalls:
- When moving right, the new head occupies (6, 0) which was not occupied by tail because tail was at (4, 0).
- Then after second move, new head becomes (7,0). But then what if there is a possibility of collision with some part? Not likely.

One potential concern: The snake's body is always behind the head. And when turning upward, the snake might run into its own body if it had not turned early enough to avoid overlapping with tail positions that remain in place. But since Option A goes along the bottom row and then up, there is no collision because the snake essentially "clears" a column as it moves.
I should check: at move 3, when moving upward from (7,0), the next cell above is (7,1). And tail segments are still on row 0. So that's safe.

Thus Option A route is valid.

Therefore answer: The sequence of moves "R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U" works.

Alternatively, if we want to provide coordinates for each segment along the path, we can list:
Step1: Head becomes (6,0)
Step2: Head becomes (7,0)
Step3: Head becomes (7,1)
Step4: Head becomes (7,2)
Step5: Head becomes (7,3)
Step6: Head becomes (7,4)
Step7: Head becomes (7,5)
Step8: Head becomes (7,6)
Step9: Head becomes (7,7) which is the target.

I can also mention that a breadth-first search algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm could be used to solve this kind of problem by treating each state as a node and moves as edges while considering collisions with the snake's body.

I should also note if there are other possible paths. The Manhattan distance from A(5,0) to B(7,7) is 2+7 =9, so any valid route must be exactly 9 moves; Option A uses 9 moves. It's likely the unique solution. However, maybe not: There could be alternative sequences if turning order changed, but it might cause collisions with body segments.

But wait, check possibility of U then R etc. For example, what about move sequence "R, U, R, U, U, U, U, U"? That would have 8 moves, so that's not enough.
What about "U, R, U, R, ..." I'd need to consider the snake's body position relative to its turns.

Given our simulation, Option A is straightforward and valid. So answer: The route is: Move right from (5,0) to (6,0), then right to (7,0); then move up consecutively until reaching (7,7).

Thus answer: "R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U" in that order.

I can mention the route coordinates:
Start at A(5, 0)
After first move: head at (6,0)
After second move: head at (7,0)
Then moves upward: head at (7,1), (7,2), ... until reaching (7,7).

Thus that's our answer.

I can also mention that alternative paths may exist if the snake could choose to turn in a different order, but then they'd likely run into self-collision given the constraints of its body and the grid.

I should check: The problem statement "Snake game route planning" probably requires to compute the sequence from starting position to target while avoiding collisions with snake's own body. So my answer is one possible solution.

I can also describe an algorithmic approach that uses BFS on state space, where each state includes positions of snake segments and direction, ensuring no moves cause overlap with its own body.

Thus final answer: The route is "R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U" (9 moves), or if we want to include coordinates for each move:
Step 1: From A(5,0) go right to B(6,0)
Step 2: From B(6,0) go right to C(7,0)
Step 3: Move up from (7,0) to D(7,1)
Step 4: Move up to E(7,2)
Step 5: Move up to F(7,3)
Step 6: Move up to G(7,4)
Step 7: Move up to H(7,5)
Step 8: Move up to I(7,6)
Step 9: Finally move up to target (7,7).

Yes.

I should also mention that the BFS algorithm would treat each state as a node and check for collisions with snake's body segments. The cost function is usually uniform moves so we can use simple BFS. However, if obstacles are present (other parts of the snake), one must consider them.

Thus final answer: "R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U".

I'll now produce my answer.</think>One correct solution is to have the snake move two steps to the right and then seven steps upward. In other words, starting from point A at (5,0), the snake can take these moves:

 • Step 1: Move Right → New head at (6,0)  
 • Step 2: Move Right → New head at (7,0)  
 • Steps 3–9: Move Up consecutively so that the head reaches (7,1), then (7,2), … and finally (7,7).

This gives you the move sequence: R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U.

Here’s why this works:
 – The Manhattan distance between A(5,0) and B(7,7) is 2 + 7 = 9 moves.  
 – Moving right first avoids any risk of colliding with the snake’s tail (since reversing immediately would be illegal when coming from an eastward direction).  
 – Once at (7,0), moving upward will never cause a collision because the body segments remain behind the head along the bottom row.

A simple breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm that treats each state (the positions of all snake segments and its current direction) as a node can be used to explore such paths. At every move you add the new head position, remove the tail segment, and check that the new head does not overlap any part of the snake’s body.

Thus, one valid route for the snake is:

 R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U

This sequence safely takes the snake from (5,0) to (7,7).
