========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly above the head at (3,8). Moving UP from (3,7) reaches the apple in one step. This avoids collisions with the body (current body is at (4,7)) and stays within grid bounds. After eating, the snake can move UP, LEFT, or other safe directions, ensuring no immediate trapping."
