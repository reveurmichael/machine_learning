 {
      "moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "UP"],
      "reasoning": "The snake starts at (3,3) and needs to move downwards to reach the apple at (1,7). To avoid immediate self-collision, we first make sure the tail does not move. So we move down to (3,4), then left towards an empty cell to (2,4), and finally up to (2,5) where the apple is located. This path ensures safety, follows the rules, and leaves an open path for the next move."
