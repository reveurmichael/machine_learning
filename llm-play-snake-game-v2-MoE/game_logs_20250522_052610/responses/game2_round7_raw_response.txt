========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I need to plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its body or going out of bounds. Let me start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (6, 2), and it's moving RIGHT currently. The body includes cells [(4, 2), (5, 2)], so the snake is two segments long behind the head. The apple is at (5,7).

First, I'll note that the current direction is RIGHT, but since the first move can't reverse, the next move can't be LEFT if the current is RIGHT.

Looking at the coordinates, the apple is to the left and above the snake's head. Specifically, from (6,2) to (5,7), the x decreases by 1 and y increases by 5. So, I need one more LEFT than RIGHT moves and five more UP than DOWN.

The body cells are behind the head at (4,2) and (5,2). Since the snake is moving right, the next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction? Wait, no—the movement rule says you can't reverse. So if current direction is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT. So from RIGHT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

Wait, but after moving, the direction changes based on the move. Oh wait, in the problem statement, it's about the movement—so each move must not reverse the direction. The current direction is RIGHT, so the next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse (since right and left are opposites). So possible moves from the current state are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But the apple is to the left (x decreases) and up (y increases), so perhaps moving UP first.

Let me visualize the grid. The head is at (6,2). The body is behind it at (5,2) and (4,2). So if I move right again, the head would go to (7,2), but that's not towards the apple. Alternatively, moving up from (6,2) takes me to (6,3).

But let's think about possible paths.

Option 1: Move UP first, then LEFT multiple times, then continue UP. But I need to make sure that after each move, the snake doesn't collide with its body.

Wait, but if I move UP, the new head is at (6,3). Then the next move can be LEFT, since previous direction was RIGHT and now moving LEFT would change direction from UP to LEFT? Or wait, movement rules say you cannot reverse direction. So each move must not be the opposite of the current direction.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement rules. Let me check:

Rule 3: The snake cannot reverse direction. If the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. But if the direction is NONE (meaning no previous direction), any move is allowed.

In this case, the current direction is RIGHT, so first move can't be LEFT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

So from (6,2), moving UP takes me to (6,3). Then next move can be LEFT, because after moving UP, the new direction would be UP, and then moving LEFT wouldn't reverse it—LEFT is perpendicular, so it's allowed. Wait no, if current direction is UP, next can't be DOWN. So from UP, possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again.

But I'm trying to get to (5,7). Let me think of the Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |2-7| = 1+5=6 steps needed.

Possible path:

From (6,2), first move can't be LEFT. So options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

If I move UP to (6,3), then from there, next moves could be LEFT towards (5,3). Then continue moving UP each step until y=7.

Let me plan that:

Move 1: UP → (6,3)
Move 2: LEFT → (5,3)
Now direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.
From (5,3), I need to go up. So move UP again.

Wait, but each time the snake moves, the body segments shift. Let me consider how the body grows after eating the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the minimal path and check for obstacles.

The straight path would be moving LEFT once and then UP five times. But can I do that without hitting the body?

Wait, current body cells are [(4,2), (5,2)], so if I move LEFT from (6,2) directly, I'd go to (5,2), which is part of the body—collision.

So moving LEFT immediately isn't possible because it would hit the body. Therefore, need to find a way around that.

So perhaps first move up, then left, then up again, etc., making sure not to step on any body cells after each movement.

Let's try:

Move 1: UP → (6,3)
Now, check if this is safe. The new head is at (6,3), which isn't part of the current body [(4,2), (5,2)], so it's safe.

Then, Move 2: LEFT → (5,3). Now, after moving, the body would update. The old head was (6,3), so the new body is [ (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) ] except the tail may have been removed if no apple is eaten.

Wait, wait—the apple hasn't been eaten yet, so when we make each move, after moving, the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten. So in this case, since we're not eating the apple immediately, after each move, the tail is cut off.

But let's track the body as moves happen:

After first move (UP to 6,3):

The snake's body becomes [ (5,2), (4,2) ] because the head was at 6,2 and moved to 6,3. Wait no—the movement works by the new head is added, and then the tail is removed unless apple is eaten.

Wait, in each step:

- New head = current head + direction.
- Then, if not eating an apple, the tail is removed; else, the body grows (tail remains).

So after moving UP to (6,3), since no apple is eaten yet, the tail (which was 4,2) is cut off. So the new body cells are [5,2], because the previous body was [4,2,5,2]? Wait, initial body is [(4,2), (5,2)], so including the head? Or does the body list exclude the head?

Wait, the input says: "Body cells: [(4, 2), (5, 2)] — List of (x, y) positions occupied by the snake's body (excluding the head)."

So after each move:

- The new head is added.
- If an apple isn't eaten, the tail is removed.

So let's track this step by step.

Initial state:

Head: (6,2)
Body: [(4,2), (5,2)]

After Move 1: UP to (6,3).

New body becomes [ (5,2) ] because after moving, the new head is at (6,3). The old body was [(4,2), (5,2)], and the tail (4,2) is removed. So body is now [(5,2)].

So Move 1: UP to (6,3), body becomes [5,2].

Move 2: LEFT from (6,3) → new head at (5,3).

Check if this is safe. The new head (5,3) isn't in the current body [(5,2)], so it's okay.

After moving, since no apple is eaten yet, tail (5,2) is cut off. So body becomes empty? Because previous body was [5,2], and after adding (6,3), then moving to 5,3—wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the movement process:

Each move step:

1. Calculate new head position.
2. Check for collision: if new head is in body or out of bounds → die.
3. If safe:
   a. Add new head to the front of the body list.
   b. If apple was not eaten at this step, remove tail (last element).
   c. Else, do not remove tail.

In our case, after first move:

- Head moves from 6,2 → 6,3
- Body was [4,2;5,2]
- Add new head to front: [6,3;4,2;5,2]
- Since no apple eaten, remove last element (4,2). So body becomes [6,3;5,2]? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the initial understanding is incorrect. Let me clarify:

The body list in input does not include the head. So initial body cells are [(4,2), (5,2)], and the head is at (6,2).

When moving UP to (6,3):

- The new head is (6,3).
- The old body was [4,2;5,2]. Now, we add the new head to the front, making [6,3;4,2;5,2], but since no apple is eaten, we remove the last cell (5,2) because tail shrinks. So the new body becomes [6,3;4,2].

Wait, that's not correct. Because after moving, the snake's body includes all previous segments except the tail if no apple was eaten.

Alternatively, perhaps each move adds the new head and removes the last cell (tail). So initial body is [(4,2), (5,2)].

Move 1: UP to (6,3).

- New head: (6,3)
- Body becomes [6,3] + previous body except tail?
Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

After each move, the snake's body is updated by adding the new head and then removing the last cell unless an apple was eaten.

So:

Initial state:

Head: (6,2)

Body cells: [(4,2), (5,2)]

Move 1: UP → (6,3). Now, since no apple eaten yet:

- New body is [ (5,2), (6,3) ]? Or wait, the head was at 6,2; after moving up to 6,3, the new head is added, and the tail (4,2) is removed. So body becomes [(5,2), (6,3)]?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me try to model each step:

Move 1: UP → (6,3)

- New head position: (6,3)
- Check collision: Is (6,3) in the body? The body is [(4,2), (5,2)], so no.
- So move is safe.
- Add new head to body list: [(4,2), (5,2), (6,3)]
- Since apple not eaten yet, remove last cell: (4,2) is removed? Or (6,3) becomes the new tail?

Wait, I think when you add the new head, then if no apple was eaten, you remove the last segment of the body.

So:

Initial body: [ (4,2), (5,2) ]

After moving UP to 6,3:

- New head is (6,3)
- Body becomes [ (6,3) ] + previous body → [(6,3), (4,2), (5,2)]?
Wait that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement adds the new head and shifts all body segments forward. So the old head becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed if no apple was eaten.

So after moving:

- New head: (6,3)
- Previous body: [4,2;5,2]
- The new body would be [ (5,2), (6,3) ] because 5,2 moves to where the head was, and 4,2 is now gone since tail is removed.

Wait, that makes sense:

Each move shifts the snake's body forward. So when you move UP from (6,2) to (6,3):

- The new head is at 6,3.
- The old head (6,2) becomes part of the body.
- Then, since no apple was eaten, the tail (4,2) is removed.

So new body is [5,2;6,2]. Because:

Old body: [4,2;5,2]

After adding new head (6,3), it's [4,2;5,2;6,3]. Then remove last element (because no apple), so becomes [4,2;5,2].

Wait that can't be right because 6,3 is the new head and shouldn't be part of the body until after moving.

I think I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe it's better to proceed step by step with each move and track the body accordingly.

Let me try planning a path:

The goal is to reach (5,7) from (6,2). The minimal Manhattan distance is 1 left and 5 up.

So perhaps moving UP first, then LEFT, then continue UP until reaching y=7.

But as I thought earlier, moving directly LEFT would hit the body. So need to find a way around.

Another approach: move UP multiple times, then LEFT, ensuring that after each step, the head doesn't collide with the body.

Let me try:

Move 1: UP → (6,3). Body becomes [5,2].

Because initial body was [4,2;5,2]. After moving to 6,3 and since no apple is eaten, tail (4,2) is removed. So body is now [5,2]?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the body update.

Alternatively, after each move:

- The new head is added.
- If not eating an apple, remove the last segment of the body.

So initial state:

Head: 6,2

Body: [4,2;5,2]

Move 1: UP → (6,3)

- New head: 6,3
- Check collision: no
- Add new head to body: [4,2;5,2;6,3]
- Since no apple eaten, remove last segment (6,3 is the head now, but wait—this doesn't make sense). I think perhaps after moving, the body becomes all previous segments except the tail.

Wait, maybe when you move, the new head is added to the front of the list, and if no apple is eaten, the last element is removed. So:

After Move 1:

- New head: (6,3)
- Body was [4,2;5,2]
- Add new head to front: [6,3;4,2;5,2]
- Remove last element (since no apple): [6,3;4,2]

So body after Move 1 is [ (6,3), (4,2) ].

But then, when moving again:

Move 2: LEFT → (5,3)

- New head: (5,3)
- Check collision with current body [6,3;4,2]. Is (5,3) in there? No.
- Add new head to front: [5,3;6,3;4,2]
- Remove last element (since no apple): [5,3;6,3]

So after Move 2, body is [5,3;6,3].

Move 3: UP → (5,4)

- New head: (5,4)
- Check collision with [5,3;6,3]. No.
- Add to front: [5,4;5,3;6,3]
- Remove last: [5,4;5,3]

Move 4: UP → (5,5)

- New head: (5,5)
- Check collision with [5,4;5,3]. No.
- Add to front: [5,5;5,4;5,3]
- Remove last: [5,5;5,4]

Continue this until reaching y=7.

So after 5 more UP moves:

Move 5: (5,6)

Body becomes [5,6;5,5]

Move 6: (5,7) → target reached!

But wait, we haven't eaten the apple yet. So each move's body is updated as above.

Wait, but how do we eat the apple? We have to be at (5,7), which is the apple's position.

Assuming that after moving to (5,7), the snake eats the apple, so the body doesn't shrink; instead, it grows by adding a new segment at the tail.

So let's see:

After Move 6: UP from (5,6) → (5,7).

- New head: (5,7)
- Check collision with current body [5,6;5,5]. No.
- Add to front: [5,7;5,6;5,5]
- Since we ate the apple at this step, do not remove tail. So body becomes [5,7;5,6;5,5].

Wait, but in reality, when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail, so the body grows by one.

But how does that happen? Let's think:

When you make a move:

- If new head is at apple position:
   - Add to front of body.
   - Do not remove tail (body length increases by 1).
- Else:
   - Add to front of body.
   - Remove last element (tail), so body remains the same length.

So in our case, after Move 6:

- New head: (5,7)
- Check if this is apple's position. Assuming yes.
- So add (5,7) to front → [5,7;5,6;5,5]
- Do not remove tail → body remains [5,7;5,6;5,5].

But the initial moves up to that point would have varying body lengths.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I can proceed step by step:

Let me outline each move with head position and body after move.

Initial:

Head: (6,2)

Body: [4,2;5,2]

Apple at (5,7).

Move 1: UP to (6,3)

- Check collision? No.
- Add to front → [6,3;4,2;5,2]
- Since no apple eaten, remove last element → body becomes [6,3;4,2].

Wait, that can't be. Because if you add new head and then remove the last segment, which was 5,2. So body is now [6,3;4,2]?

But this seems like a problem because when moving again from (6,3), the next move's body would affect collision detection.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that each time you move, your body includes all previous segments except the tail, unless you ate an apple.

So let me try to outline step by step with moves and updated bodies:

Move 1: UP → (6,3)

- Body before move: [4,2;5,2]
- New head: (6,3)
- Check collision? No.
- Add new head to body front: [6,3;4,2;5,2]
- Since no apple eaten, remove last element → [6,3;4,2]

So after Move 1:

Head: (6,3)

Body: [4,2;5,2]? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the body should be [5,2;6,3]?

I think I'm getting stuck on how the body updates. Maybe it's better to look for an alternative approach.

Another idea: Since moving directly left from (6,2) is blocked by body cells (4,2 and 5,2), we need to move UP first to create space.

So perhaps a path like:

UP, LEFT, then UP five times.

But let me check if that's possible without collision.

Wait, but after each move, the body changes. So I have to track it carefully.

Let me try again step by step.

Move 1: UP → (6,3)

- Check collision with body [4,2;5,2]. No.
- New body becomes [5,2;6,3] because we add new head and remove tail? Or is the tail 4,2 removed?

Wait, perhaps when you move, the new head is added to the front, and if no apple is eaten, the last segment is removed. So:

After Move 1:

Body was [4,2;5,2]

Add (6,3) to front → [6,3;4,2;5,2]

Remove last element (since no apple) → [6,3;4,2]

So body after Move 1 is [6,3;4,2].

Wait, but that would mean the snake's body is now [6,3;4,2], which seems disconnected.

But in reality, the snake should be a continuous path from head to tail. So perhaps my model is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the body segments follow the path of the snake's previous positions, and each move shifts them forward. So when moving UP, all body segments move towards the new head.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's better to assume that after each move, except for eating an apple, the tail is removed, so the body length remains the same.

But in our case, initial body has two segments (excluding head), and after moving, if we don't eat an apple, the body remains two segments.

So:

Initial head: (6,2)

Body: [4,2;5,2]

Move 1: UP → (6,3)

- New head: (6,3)
- Check collision with body [4,2;5,2]. No.
- Add new head to front of body → [6,3;4,2;5,2]
- Since no apple eaten, remove last segment (5,2) → body becomes [6,3;4,2]

Wait, but that leaves the body as two segments: 6,3 and 4,2. That seems like a gap.

But perhaps it's allowed in this model.

Move 2: LEFT → (5,3)

- New head: (5,3)
- Check collision with body [6,3;4,2]. No.
- Add new head to front → [5,3;6,3;4,2]
- Remove last segment (4,2) → body becomes [5,3;6,3]

Move 3: UP → (5,4)

- New head: (5,4)
- Check collision with [5,3;6,3]. No.
- Add to front → [5,4;5,3;6,3]
- Remove last segment (6,3) → body becomes [5,4;5,3]

Move 4: UP → (5,5)

- New head: (5,5)
- Check collision with [5,4;5,3]. No.
- Add to front → [5,5;5,4;5,3]
- Remove last segment (5,3) → body becomes [5,5;5,4]

Move 5: UP → (5,6)

- New head: (5,6)
- Check collision with [5,5;5,4]. No.
- Add to front → [5,6;5,5;5,4]
- Remove last segment (5,4) → body becomes [5,6;5,5]

Move 6: UP → (5,7)

- New head: (5,7)
- Check collision with [5,6;5,5]. No.
- Add to front → [5,7;5,6;5,5]
- Since we ate the apple at (5,7), do not remove tail → body becomes [5,7;5,6;5,5]

So now, the snake has successfully eaten the apple and grown by one segment.

Thus, the path is:

UP, LEFT, UP, UP, UP, UP.

That's a total of 6 moves.

Wait, but in terms of steps, it's Move 1: UP, then Move 2: LEFT, then four more UPs. So that's six moves in total.

But perhaps I can do it in fewer moves by taking a different path?

Alternatively, maybe moving right first? But initial position is (6,2), and body blocks (4,2;5,2). Moving right would go to (7,2), which is clear, but then how to proceed?

Let me try that approach.

Move 1: RIGHT → (7,2)

- Check collision with [4,2;5,2]. No.
- Add to front → [7,2;4,2;5,2]
- Remove last segment (5,2) → body becomes [7,2;4,2]

Move 2: UP → (7,3)

- Check collision with [7,2;4,2]. No.
- Add to front → [7,3;7,2;4,2]
- Remove last segment (4,2) → body becomes [7,3;7,2]

Move 3: LEFT → (6,3)

- Check collision with [7,3;7,2]. No.
- Add to front → [6,3;7,3;7,2]
- Remove last segment (7,2) → body becomes [6,3;7,3]

Move 4: LEFT → (5,3)

- Check collision with [6,3;7,3]. No.
- Add to front → [5,3;6,3;7,3]
- Remove last segment (7,3) → body becomes [5,3;6,3]

Now, we can move UP towards the apple.

Move 5: UP → (5,4)

- Check collision with [5,3;6,3]. No.
- Add to front → [5,4;5,3;6,3]
- Remove last segment (6,3) → body becomes [5,4;5,3]

Move 6: UP → (5,5)

- Check collision with [5,4;5,3]. No.
- Add to front → [5,5;5,4;5,3]
- Remove last segment (5,3) → body becomes [5,5;5,4]

Move 7: UP → (5,6)

- Check collision with [5,5;5,4]. No.
- Add to front → [5,6;5,5;5,4]
- Remove last segment (5,4) → body becomes [5,6;5,5]

Move 8: UP → (5,7)

- Eats apple. Body becomes [5,7;5,6;5,5].

So that took 8 moves, which is worse than the previous approach.

Therefore, moving first up then left seems better with only 6 moves.

But wait, let me recount:

In the first approach:

Move 1: UP → (6,3)

Body after Move 1: [6,3;4,2]

Move 2: LEFT → (5,3)

Body after Move 2: [5,3;6,3]

Move 3: UP → (5,4)

Body after Move 3: [5,4;5,3]

Move 4: UP → (5,5)

Body after Move 4: [5,5;5,4]

Move 5: UP → (5,6)

Body after Move 5: [5,6;5,5]

Move 6: UP → (5,7) and eat apple.

So total moves: 6.

That seems efficient.

Alternatively, is there a way to do it in fewer moves?

Wait, perhaps the initial move could be LEFT twice?

But from (6,2), moving LEFT would go to (5,2), which is blocked by body cell (5,2). So can't do that.

Thus, the minimal path seems to be UP, then LEFT, then four UPs: total of 6 moves.

So the answer is 6 moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required for a snake starting at position (6,2) with its body occupying positions (4,2) and (5,2) to reach and eat an apple located at (5,7). The snake can move up, down, left, or right one cell at a time.

### Approach
The key strategy is to navigate the snake around its own body to reach the target position. Since moving directly left from the starting position is blocked by the snake's body, the optimal path involves first moving upward to create space and then proceeding towards the target. Here are the steps:

1. **Move Up**: From (6,2) to (6,3). This move avoids collision with the snake's body.
2. **Move Left**: From (6,3) to (5,3). This further moves the head away from the body.
3. **Continue Moving Up**: From (5,3) upwards through positions (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), and finally reaching (5,7).

Each move shifts the snake's body segments accordingly, ensuring no collision until the final position where the apple is eaten.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the moves required for the snake to reach the apple.

def main():
    # Initial positions
    head = (6, 2)
    body = [(4, 2), (5, 2)]
    target = (5, 7)

    # Path planning
    path = [
        ('UP', (6,3)),
        ('LEFT', (5,3)),
        ('UP', (5,4)),
        ('UP', (5,5)),
        ('UP', (5,6)),
        ('UP', (5,7))
    ]

    # Simulate each move
    for move in path:
        direction, new_head = move
        print(f"Move: {direction}")
        # Update head and body accordingly
        head = new_head
        # The body would update by adding new_head to front and removing tail if not eating apple

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (6,2) with its body occupying cells (4,2) and (5,2).
2. **First Move (UP)**: Moving up to (6,3) avoids collision.
3. **Second Move (LEFT)**: From (6,3) to (5,3), moving left safely away from the body.
4. **Subsequent Moves (UP)**: Continuing upwards each time, ensuring no collision with the snake's body until reaching the target.

This approach ensures that the snake efficiently navigates around its own body and reaches the apple in the minimum number of moves, which is 6 in total.
