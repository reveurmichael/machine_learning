========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (9,7). The current direction is "NONE", which means my first move can be any of UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. 

First, let me understand the grid. It's a 10x10 grid, so coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. The head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (9,7). So, I need to move right four times and up two times because moving right increases x and moving up increases y.

But wait, since the grid is 10x10, from (5,5) to (9,7) would require moving right 4 steps and up 2 steps. That makes sense because 9-5=4 in x-direction and 7-5=2 in y-direction.

Now, considering the snake's body. The body is given as an empty list, which means it's just the head—so no body segments behind it. That simplifies things because I don't have to worry about collision with my own body yet.

The first move can be any direction except reversing. Since the current direction is NONE, all moves are allowed. So, I need to choose a path that gets me to the apple without getting stuck or colliding.

Looking at the apple's position, it's in the top-right area. The snake needs to go right four times and up two times. But since movement can be done in any order as long as the overall steps match, perhaps moving mostly right first and then up would work.

But wait, I should also consider that after each move, the body will follow. If I grow too long, I might block my own path. Since the body is empty now, it's safe to start moving towards the apple without worrying about collision for a few steps.

Let me think of possible moves:

1. First, move RIGHT four times to reach x=9, then UP two times. But that would require six moves. Let me see if there's any obstacle. The initial body is empty, so no problem.

Wait, but after moving right once, the body will be [(5,5)] because it was the head before. Then when I move again, the body will add the new position.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient way is to plan a path that first moves towards the apple, ensuring each step doesn't lead into a collision.

But since the initial body is empty, moving right four times and then up two times should work without any issues. Let me simulate this:

- Start at (5,5), direction NONE.
- Move RIGHT: head becomes (6,5). Body is now empty because it's just the head; no segments yet.
- Next move RIGHT: (7,5). Again, body is [(6,5)] but since I'm moving right again, which doesn't collide with anything.
- Third move RIGHT: (8,5).
- Fourth move RIGHT: (9,5).
- Now, to get up two steps. First UP: (9,6), then another UP: (9,7) where the apple is.

Wait a second, after moving right four times, I'm at (9,5). Then moving up twice gets me to (9,7). That seems correct.

But wait, when I move from (9,5) to (9,6), that's safe because there's no body yet. Similarly, moving to (9,7) would eat the apple. But after eating, the snake grows by one segment, so the body will add the previous head position without removing the tail.

But wait, when I'm at (9,5) and choose UP, that becomes the new head. The body was empty before, but since we're moving towards the apple, let's see:

Wait, no, actually, after each move, if not eating an apple, the body shifts. But in this case, when I reach (9,7), that is the apple, so the body will grow.

But wait, the initial body is empty, so when I make the first four rights, each time, the body adds the previous head. So:

Move 1: RIGHT to (6,5). Body becomes [ (5,5) ].
Move 2: RIGHT to (7,5). Body becomes [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. Wait no—actually, according to movement rules, when you move normally, the body is updated by inserting old head at front and then possibly removing tail.

Wait, in the example given, after moving LEFT from (4,4) with body [(4,3)], the new body becomes [ (4,4), (4,3) ] but then if not eating apple, remove the tail—so body is [ (4,4) ].

So applying that to our case:

Starting at (5,5), body empty.

Move RIGHT: new head (6,5). Since it's a normal move (not eating apple yet), body becomes [ (5,5) ]. So after first move, body has [(5,5)].

Second move: RIGHT again. New head (7,5). Body is now [ (6,5), (5,5) ], but since not eating apple, remove tail (5,5)—so body is [ (6,5) ].

Wait no—step 3a says insert old head at front of the BODY list. So for each move:

After moving RIGHT first time:
- Insert old head (5,5) into front → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Since not eating apple, remove tail → body is empty because initial body was empty.

Wait no—no, wait: step 3 says after inserting the old head at front of BODY list, if not growing, then remove last element. So in this case:

Initial S is [ (5,5) ] as head and body empty.

Move RIGHT:
- New head is (6,5).
- Since it's a normal move (not apple), insert old head into front → body becomes [(5,5)].
- Then remove tail because not eating apple. But the tail was nothing before—so body remains empty after removal?

Wait that doesn't make sense. Wait, in movement update step 3:

a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1).

b. If new_head == apple position, grow: do not remove tail.

c. Otherwise, move normally: remove last element of BODY.

So, initial state: HEAD is (5,5), BODY is empty.

After moving RIGHT:

- New head is (6,5).
- Insert old head into front → BODY becomes [ (5,5) ].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → but the body has only one element. So after removal, body becomes empty again.

So each move appends the previous head to the body and then removes it unless an apple is eaten.

Wait that can't be right because in the example given when moving LEFT:

After moving LEFT from (4,4) with body [(4,3)], new head is (3,4). Insert old head → body becomes [ (4,4), (4,3) ], then remove tail because not eating apple, so body becomes [ (4,4) ].

So applying that to our case:

Move 1: RIGHT from (5,5) → (6,5). Insert (5,5) into front of empty body → body is [(5,5)]. Then, since no apple eaten, remove tail → but the body has only one element, so it's removed. So after first move, body is empty.

Wait that seems odd. Because in the example, when moving LEFT from a two-segment snake, the body becomes longer because they inserted and didn't remove (since they ate an apple). But in our case, each move adds the previous head to the front but then removes it if no apple is eaten, leading to body remaining empty.

But that can't be right. Because when you're moving without eating, the body should follow the path of the previous head. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding step 3.

Let me re-read step 3:

Update body positions (assuming no collision and within bounds):

a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list → becomes BODY1.

b. If new_head == apple position, grow: do not remove tail this turn.

c. Otherwise, move normally: remove last element of BODY.

So for each normal move:

BODY is updated by adding the old head to front and then removing the last element unless we ate an apple.

In our initial case, moving from (5,5) with empty body:

Move 1: RIGHT → new_head (6,5).

a. Insert old_head (5,5) at front of BODY → [ (5,5) ].

b. Not eating apple → remove last element → so body becomes empty again.

So after first move, the body is empty, and head is (6,5). That seems like no progress in body growth unless we eat an apple.

Wait that can't be right because then the snake's body never grows unless it eats an apple. Which makes sense.

So, to make the body longer, you need to eat apples. Otherwise, each move only shifts the head and removes the old head from the body.

Hmm, but in the example given when eating an apple:

S = [HEAD (5,5), BODY1 (5,4), BODY2 (5,3)] → new_head (6,5). Since it's equal to apple position, step 3b says grow: do not remove tail. So after inserting old head, the body becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)], and since we ate an apple, we don't remove the last element → so body remains three elements.

But in our case, without eating apples, each move only adds and then removes the previous head. So body is empty after each move unless we eat an apple.

So that suggests that in order to get a longer body, you need to eat more apples. But in this problem, we have only one apple at (9,7). So once we reach there, we can grow by one segment.

But let's think about the path:

We need to go from (5,5) → right 4 times and up twice.

So possible steps:

1. Move RIGHT four times: from (5,5) → (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5).

After each of these moves, the body is empty because we're not eating apples yet.

Then, move UP two times to reach (9,7). Each UP move would add the previous head position but then remove it unless we eat an apple.

Wait, when moving from (9,5) to (9,6), that's a normal move. Body inserts (9,5) into front → body is [(9,5)], then since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty again.

Then moving UP again to (9,7). This time, new_head is (9,7), which is the apple. So step 3b applies: grow without removing tail.

So after inserting old head (9,6) into front of BODY (which was empty), we get [(9,6)], and since eating apple, do not remove → body remains [(9,6)].

But wait, initial state before moving UP:

- Head is at (9,5). Move UP to (9,6).

No, sorry. Let's retrace:

After four RIGHT moves, head is at (9,5), body empty.

First UP move: new_head is (9,6). Insert old head (9,5) into front → body becomes [(9,5)]. Since not eating apple yet? Wait, but the apple is at (9,7), so when we move to (9,6), that's just another step towards it.

So after first UP move:

- Head: (9,6)
- Body: inserted old head (9,5) → [(9,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element (which is only one) → body becomes empty again.

Wait no—the movement to (9,6) would have new_head at (9,6). The apple is at (9,7), so we haven't eaten yet. So after moving UP, the body becomes [(9,5)], then remove it because no apple eaten, leading to empty body again.

Then second UP move: from (9,6) → (9,7).

Now, new_head is (9,7), which is the apple's position. So:

a. Insert old head (9,6) into front of BODY → body becomes [(9,6)].

b. Since new_head == apple, do not remove tail. So body remains [(9,6)] after this move.

So now, after eating the apple at (9,7), the body is [ (9,6) ] because we inserted (9,6) and didn't remove anything.

But wait, the initial head was (9,5). Then moved to (9,6), then to (9,7).

Wait, no. Let's correct:

Move 1: RIGHT → (6,5), body empty.

Move 2: RIGHT → (7,5), body [ (6,5) ] → but since not eating apple, remove → body empty.

Similarly for each move until after four rights, head is at (9,5), body empty.

Then:

Move 5: UP → (9,6). Insert old_head (9,5) into front of BODY → [(9,5)]. Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty again.

Wait no—step a says insert old_head to front of the BODY list. So after moving UP from (9,5), new head is (9,6). Inserting (9,5) into front: body was empty before this move, so now it's [(9,5)].

But since we didn't eat an apple, step 3c applies: remove last element of BODY → which is (9,5). So after that move, body is empty again.

Move 6: UP → (9,7), which is the apple. Insert old head (9,6) into front of empty BODY → [(9,6)]. Since we ate an apple, step 3b applies: do not remove last element. So body remains [(9,6)] after this move.

So after six moves, the snake's head is at (9,7), having eaten the apple, and its body has one segment at (9,6).

But wait, the initial problem didn't mention any other apples or obstacles, so as long as we reach (9,7) in two UP moves after four RIGHT moves, it should be okay.

So the total number of moves would be 4 (RIGHT) + 2 (UP) = 6 moves. But let's check if this is the minimal path.

Is there a shorter way? Well, moving diagonally isn't possible since each move is either UP or RIGHT. So no, six moves are required.

But wait, perhaps I can mix the order of moves to reduce collision risk with future body segments, but in this case, since we start with an empty body, it's safe to go straight.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first then RIGHT? Let me see:

From (5,5), move UP twice first: (5,6) and (5,7). Then move RIGHT four times. That would require the same number of moves but in a different order. However, this path might lead to more body segments that could block the way.

But since starting with an empty body, it doesn't matter whether I go right or up first—the result is the same in terms of collision risk because there are no body parts yet.

Wait, let's think again: moving UP first would make the head move towards (5,7), then when moving RIGHT four times, the body would be behind. But since we're starting with an empty body, it's still safe either way.

But considering that the apple is at (9,7), which is higher up than our starting position in both x and y directions. So logically, going right first makes sense because we need to cover more ground in the x-direction before dealing with y.

So perhaps the minimal path is four rights then two ups.

Now, let me think about whether this sequence would work without any collisions:

- Move RIGHT → (6,5)
- Move RIGHT → (7,5)
- Move RIGHT → (8,5)
- Move RIGHT → (9,5)
- Move UP → (9,6)
- Move UP → (9,7) (apple eaten)

At each step, the body is either empty or a single segment that's removed after the move unless an apple is eaten.

Therefore, this path seems safe and collision-free.

But let me check if any of these moves could lead to a collision:

Since we start with an empty body, moving right four times doesn't cause any collision because there are no segments behind. Similarly, when moving up twice from (9,5), the only possible collision would be with the body segment left at (9,6). But since after moving UP once, the body is [ (9,5) ], but then we remove it upon not eating an apple.

Wait, in step 3:

After each move where you don't eat an apple, you insert the old head and then remove the tail. So when moving from (9,5) to (9,6), which isn't eating an apple, the body becomes [ (9,5) ], then is removed.

So after that first UP move, the body is empty again. Then moving UP to (9,7) would insert (9,6) and keep it because we ate an apple.

Therefore, there's no collision during any of these moves except when eating the apple—where the previous head becomes part of the body.

So in conclusion, the sequence of four rights followed by two ups will lead the snake to eat the apple at (9,7) without colliding with its own body.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple located at a specific coordinate on a grid. The snake can move in four directions, and each move affects the snake's body segments behind it unless it eats an apple, which allows the snake to grow.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Grid and Movement**: The grid is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. The snake starts at (5,5), and the apple is at (9,7). The goal is to move the snake's head to (9,7).

2. **Determine Required Movements**: To reach (9,7) from (5,5), the snake needs to move right 4 times (to increase the x-coordinate from 5 to 9) and up 2 times (to increase the y-coordinate from 5 to 7).

3. **Plan the Path**: The optimal path involves moving right four consecutive times to reach column 9, then moving up twice to reach row 7. This ensures that the snake's head reaches the apple without unnecessary detours.

4. **Handle Body Segments**: Each move affects the snake's body segments behind it. If the snake eats an apple, its body grows by one segment; otherwise, the oldest segment is removed. Since we start with no body segments, moving right first ensures safe traversal without immediate collision risks.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code simulates the snake's movement towards the target.
# Each move updates the head position and handles body segments accordingly.

def main():
    # Initialize the snake's starting position and body (empty initially)
    head = (5, 5)
    body = []
    target = (9, 7)

    # Calculate the required movements
    moves = [
        'RIGHT',  # Move right four times
        'RIGHT',
        'RIGHT',
        'RIGHT',
        'UP',     # Move up two times
        'UP'
    ]

    for move in moves:
        # Update head position based on the direction
        if move == 'RIGHT':
            new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
        elif move == 'UP':
            new_head = (head[0], head[1] + 1)
        
        # Check if the new head is at the target position (apple location)
        if new_head == target:
            print("Eaten apple! New body segment added.")
            body.append(head)  # Add the old head to body
        else:
            # Remove the oldest segment if not eating an apple
            if body:
                body.pop(0)
        
        # Update the head position
        head = new_head
        
        print(f"Move: {move}, Head at {head}, Body: {body}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The snake starts at (5,5) with an empty body.
2. **Movement Loop**: Each move in the predefined sequence directs the snake's head to a new position.
3. **Apple Check**: If the new head position matches the target (9,7), the snake eats the apple, and the old head is added to the body without removing any segments.
4. **Body Management**: Without eating an apple, the oldest segment of the body is removed to prevent unnecessary growth and potential collisions.

This approach ensures the snake efficiently reaches the target by moving right four times and then up twice, avoiding collisions with its own body throughout the journey.
