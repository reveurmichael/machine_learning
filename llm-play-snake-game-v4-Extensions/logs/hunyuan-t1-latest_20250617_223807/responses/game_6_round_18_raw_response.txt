{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (3,0) with direction DOWN, which is invalid (would move out of bounds). First move must be RIGHT (avoiding reverse of DOWN). Moving RIGHT four times reaches x=7, then moving UP eight times aligns with the apple at (7,8). Each step avoids body collisions and stays in bounds. After reaching the apple, there are legal moves (e.g., UP, LEFT, RIGHT) to avoid trapping."
