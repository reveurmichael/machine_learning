00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,150

today I'm going to build five Lego

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,160
today I'm going to build five Lego
 

3
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,750
today I'm going to build five Lego
Bridges using different techniques to

4
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:02,760
Bridges using different techniques to
 

5
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,030
Bridges using different techniques to
see which one can hold up the best

6
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,040
see which one can hold up the best
 

7
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,150
see which one can hold up the best
against weighted Lego cars but first

8
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
against weighted Lego cars but first
 

9
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,550
against weighted Lego cars but first
let's see how much weight Lego can hold

10
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:07,560
let's see how much weight Lego can hold
 

11
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,350
let's see how much weight Lego can hold
before it breaks starting with 5 lb 10

12
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:10,360
before it breaks starting with 5 lb 10
 

13
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,430
before it breaks starting with 5 lb 10
lb 20 25 are you kidding 30

14
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:14,440
lb 20 25 are you kidding 30
 

15
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,550
lb 20 25 are you kidding 30
lb uh 35 lb I'm all out of

16
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,560
lb uh 35 lb I'm all out of
 

17
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,910
lb uh 35 lb I'm all out of
Weights as you see Lego can hold up a

18
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
Weights as you see Lego can hold up a
 

19
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,910
Weights as you see Lego can hold up a
lot of weight so we're going to build up

20
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:22,920
lot of weight so we're going to build up
 

21
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,390
lot of weight so we're going to build up
some Lego Bridges starting with the most

22
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
some Lego Bridges starting with the most
 

23
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,269
some Lego Bridges starting with the most
basic bridge design an arch bridge it

24
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:26,279
basic bridge design an arch bridge it
 

25
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,790
basic bridge design an arch bridge it
literally just has an arch but ours is

26
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:27,800
literally just has an arch but ours is
 

27
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,830
literally just has an arch but ours is
going to need to be pretty long cuz we

28
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
going to need to be pretty long cuz we
 

29
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,550
going to need to be pretty long cuz we
have a 4T pool of water we're going to

30
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
have a 4T pool of water we're going to
 

31
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,190
have a 4T pool of water we're going to
be driving these vehicles

32
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,200

 

33
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,549

over now that we got a solid foundation

34
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
over now that we got a solid foundation
 

35
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,790
over now that we got a solid foundation
we can start building the arch we're

36
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:39,800
we can start building the arch we're
 

37
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,869
we can start building the arch we're
going to build this in two halves so

38
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
going to build this in two halves so
 

39
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,150
going to build this in two halves so
what I'm going to do is just grab a

40
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
what I'm going to do is just grab a
 

41
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,069
what I'm going to do is just grab a
brick and go out one stud and then we

42
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:45,079
brick and go out one stud and then we
 

43
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,549
brick and go out one stud and then we
can go maybe two out as long as we just

44
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:47,559
can go maybe two out as long as we just
 

45
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,470
can go maybe two out as long as we just
increase the number we can get an arch

46
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:49,480
increase the number we can get an arch
 

47
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,549
increase the number we can get an arch
going I'm just going to keep building

48
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
going I'm just going to keep building
 

49
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,790
going I'm just going to keep building
and hopefully we'll get something strong

50
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:51,800
and hopefully we'll get something strong
 

51
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,950
and hopefully we'll get something strong
enough to drive the cars over as you can

52
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:53,960
enough to drive the cars over as you can
 

53
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,709
enough to drive the cars over as you can
see we're getting some Headway here now

54
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:55,719
see we're getting some Headway here now
 

55
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,910
see we're getting some Headway here now
we're overlapping on this side by three

56
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:56,920
we're overlapping on this side by three
 

57
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,430
we're overlapping on this side by three
studs and pretty soon I'm just going to

58
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:58,440
studs and pretty soon I'm just going to
 

59
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,509
studs and pretty soon I'm just going to
do a band that goes across so Arch will

60
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:00,519
do a band that goes across so Arch will
 

61
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,990
do a band that goes across so Arch will
just be on the sides the science behind

62
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
just be on the sides the science behind
 

63
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,389
just be on the sides the science behind
this is actually super unique every

64
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:03,399
this is actually super unique every
 

65
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,429
this is actually super unique every
layer you go down it divides the weight

66
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
layer you go down it divides the weight
 

67
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,510
layer you go down it divides the weight
into the layers below it so any pressure

68
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
into the layers below it so any pressure
 

69
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,550
into the layers below it so any pressure
up top is divided all the way down kind

70
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:09,560
up top is divided all the way down kind
 

71
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,990
up top is divided all the way down kind
of similar to how a heavy object becomes

72
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,000
of similar to how a heavy object becomes
 

73
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,070
of similar to how a heavy object becomes
lighter when you have a friend to move

74
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
lighter when you have a friend to move
 

75
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,270
lighter when you have a friend to move
it with you if we build it like this

76
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
it with you if we build it like this
 

77
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,630
it with you if we build it like this
it'll be really strong so now we just

78
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
it'll be really strong so now we just
 

79
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,590
it'll be really strong so now we just
got to build one more of these and we

80
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
got to build one more of these and we
 

81
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,550
got to build one more of these and we
connect it with a road up top and test

82
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:17,560
connect it with a road up top and test
 

83
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,950
connect it with a road up top and test
it

84
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
it
 

85
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,990
it
out okay so we have the bottom part of

86
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,000
out okay so we have the bottom part of
 

87
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,990
out okay so we have the bottom part of
the arch bridge then I'm just going to

88
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
the arch bridge then I'm just going to
 

89
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,190
the arch bridge then I'm just going to
take the top of this bridge and snap it

90
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
take the top of this bridge and snap it
 

91
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,789
take the top of this bridge and snap it
down on top of here then we just got to

92
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
down on top of here then we just got to
 

93
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,749
down on top of here then we just got to
gently push this down on the edges here

94
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:26,759
gently push this down on the edges here
 

95
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,270
gently push this down on the edges here
that should snap in so here we have the

96
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,280
that should snap in so here we have the
 

97
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,030
that should snap in so here we have the
first Bridge the arch bridge all set up

98
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,040
first Bridge the arch bridge all set up
 

99
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,310
first Bridge the arch bridge all set up
I have the Lego Corvette as the first

100
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,320
I have the Lego Corvette as the first
 

101
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,550
I have the Lego Corvette as the first
car of the video and I've done two

102
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
car of the video and I've done two
 

103
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,270
car of the video and I've done two
things first I've built this little

104
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:34,280
things first I've built this little
 

105
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,710
things first I've built this little
adapter for the top here and that's

106
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:35,720
adapter for the top here and that's
 

107
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,630
adapter for the top here and that's
going to allow us to put different

108
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
going to allow us to put different
 

109
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,350
going to allow us to put different
weights on the car so we can see how

110
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,360
weights on the car so we can see how
 

111
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,630
weights on the car so we can see how
much weight each one of these Bridges

112
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:39,640
much weight each one of these Bridges
 

113
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,030
much weight each one of these Bridges
can handle and then the second thing is

114
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
can handle and then the second thing is
 

115
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,910
can handle and then the second thing is
I've built up this winch system using a

116
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:42,920
I've built up this winch system using a
 

117
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,630
I've built up this winch system using a
LEGO motor and a worm gear and that will

118
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
LEGO motor and a worm gear and that will
 

119
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,030
LEGO motor and a worm gear and that will
actually pull it across so if we touch

120
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,040
actually pull it across so if we touch
 

121
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,630
actually pull it across so if we touch
our little clip there we got to get our

122
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:47,640
our little clip there we got to get our
 

123
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,030
our little clip there we got to get our
ooot crash test dummy inside the vehicle

124
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,040
ooot crash test dummy inside the vehicle
 

125
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,109
ooot crash test dummy inside the vehicle
if we just Crush just a little bit like

126
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:52,119
if we just Crush just a little bit like
 

127
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,550
if we just Crush just a little bit like
that all right here we go let's test I'm

128
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
that all right here we go let's test I'm
 

129
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,190
that all right here we go let's test I'm
going to turn this on click the Switch

130
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
going to turn this on click the Switch
 

131
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,350
going to turn this on click the Switch
and we're going to see if it can pull it

132
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,360
and we're going to see if it can pull it
 

133
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,149
and we're going to see if it can pull it
across oh my gosh it's a nerve-wracking

134
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
across oh my gosh it's a nerve-wracking
 

135
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,910
across oh my gosh it's a nerve-wracking
is it going to move it's going it's

136
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
is it going to move it's going it's
 

137
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,429
is it going to move it's going it's
moving I'm so nervous I'm so nervous it

138
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:02,439
moving I'm so nervous I'm so nervous it
 

139
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,149
moving I'm so nervous I'm so nervous it
has to make it all the way across for it

140
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
has to make it all the way across for it
 

141
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,109
has to make it all the way across for it
to

142
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119

 

143
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,150

count all right we made it all the way

144
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,160
count all right we made it all the way
 

145
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,869
count all right we made it all the way
across let's up it to 10

146
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:11,879
across let's up it to 10
 

147
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,949
across let's up it to 10
lb okay it's moving oh no I don't think

148
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
lb okay it's moving oh no I don't think
 

149
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,229

it's going to work I think it's going to

150
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
it's going to work I think it's going to
 

151
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,509
it's going to work I think it's going to
crash right when it gets to the

152
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:18,519
crash right when it gets to the
 

153
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,430
crash right when it gets to the
middle steer it back okay 10 lbs in the

154
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
middle steer it back okay 10 lbs in the
 

155
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,309

middle of the bridge both wheels are not

156
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:23,319
middle of the bridge both wheels are not
 

157
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,550
middle of the bridge both wheels are not
happy right now they are not rolling

158
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
happy right now they are not rolling
 

159
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,430
happy right now they are not rolling

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,440
under that
 

161
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,830
under that
weight dude this little winch is working

162
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:28,840
weight dude this little winch is working
 

163
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,830
weight dude this little winch is working
perfectly it just pulled 10 lb

164
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:30,840
perfectly it just pulled 10 lb
 

165
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,430
perfectly it just pulled 10 lb
successfully across this bridge the arch

166
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
successfully across this bridge the arch
 

167
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,150
successfully across this bridge the arch
bridge is a complete success as you can

168
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,160
bridge is a complete success as you can
 

169
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,030
bridge is a complete success as you can
see our U guy he's totally fine so let's

170
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
see our U guy he's totally fine so let's
 

171
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,150
see our U guy he's totally fine so let's
build up the next bridge and test the

172
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
build up the next bridge and test the
 

173
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,670
build up the next bridge and test the
next car for the next bridge I want to

174
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
next car for the next bridge I want to
 

175
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,790
next car for the next bridge I want to
build a tensegrity bridge which has

176
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:41,800
build a tensegrity bridge which has
 

177
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,149
build a tensegrity bridge which has
never been done before because it's

178
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:43,159
never been done before because it's
 

179
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,750
never been done before because it's
super unsafe and wouldn't work in real

180
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:44,760
super unsafe and wouldn't work in real
 

181
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,270
super unsafe and wouldn't work in real
life but it might work in Lego so the

182
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,280
life but it might work in Lego so the
 

183
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,589
life but it might work in Lego so the
first thing we got to do is build up a

184
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
first thing we got to do is build up a
 

185
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,110
first thing we got to do is build up a
road and then we'll build a tensity part

186
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
road and then we'll build a tensity part
 

187
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,190
road and then we'll build a tensity part
Underneath

188
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
Underneath
 

189
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,309
Underneath
It All right so now that we got the road

190
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:53,319
It All right so now that we got the road
 

191
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,910
It All right so now that we got the road
for the second bridge done it looks a

192
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:54,920
for the second bridge done it looks a
 

193
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,470
for the second bridge done it looks a
lot like the road for the first bridge

194
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
lot like the road for the first bridge
 

195
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,869
lot like the road for the first bridge
but now we're going to build the

196
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:57,879
but now we're going to build the
 

197
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,949
but now we're going to build the
tensegrity things that are going to

198
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
tensegrity things that are going to
 

199
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,070
tensegrity things that are going to
actually hold this up if you're not

200
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
actually hold this up if you're not
 

201
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,550
actually hold this up if you're not
familiar with the term tensegrity it's

202
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:01,560
familiar with the term tensegrity it's
 

203
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,589
familiar with the term tensegrity it's
this concept where you have two

204
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:02,599
this concept where you have two
 

205
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,670
this concept where you have two
platforms and three ropes and they link

206
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,680
platforms and three ropes and they link
 

207
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,789
platforms and three ropes and they link
together in such a way where it looks

208
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:05,799
together in such a way where it looks
 

209
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,670
together in such a way where it looks
like the top platform is floating so I'm

210
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
like the top platform is floating so I'm
 

211
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,390
like the top platform is floating so I'm
thinking we build a tensegrity on each

212
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:09,400
thinking we build a tensegrity on each
 

213
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,350
thinking we build a tensegrity on each
side of the bridge so it'll technically

214
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
side of the bridge so it'll technically
 

215
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,990
side of the bridge so it'll technically
be floating and possibly wobbly so we're

216
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
be floating and possibly wobbly so we're
 

217
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,789
be floating and possibly wobbly so we're
going to start with a base plate for the

218
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:15,799
going to start with a base plate for the
 

219
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,110
going to start with a base plate for the
bottom so let's build a quick base on

220
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
bottom so let's build a quick base on
 

221
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,270
bottom so let's build a quick base on
top of

222
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
top of
 

223
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,110
top of
this and I'm going to attach some

224
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
this and I'm going to attach some
 

225
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,910
this and I'm going to attach some
Technic bricks right here separated by a

226
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:22,920
Technic bricks right here separated by a
 

227
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,070
Technic bricks right here separated by a
couple of plates and that way we can put

228
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
couple of plates and that way we can put
 

229
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,910
couple of plates and that way we can put
the hook in it put two plates and

230
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
the hook in it put two plates and
 

231
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,470
the hook in it put two plates and
another techic brick and now this should

232
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:27,480
another techic brick and now this should
 

233
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,350
another techic brick and now this should
stand up

234
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,360
stand up
 

235
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,350
stand up
straight nice we just got to build a

236
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,360
straight nice we just got to build a
 

237
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,910
straight nice we just got to build a
sing up to be a little taller and then

238
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
sing up to be a little taller and then
 

239
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,030
sing up to be a little taller and then
go out in this

240
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,040

 

241
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,630

direction

242
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
direction
 

243
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,710
direction
now so now that we have this first hook

244
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
now so now that we have this first hook
 

245
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,229
now so now that we have this first hook
we just need to make another one that we

246
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
we just need to make another one that we
 

247
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,869
we just need to make another one that we
will invert and put upside down then

248
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:43,879
will invert and put upside down then
 

249
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,070
will invert and put upside down then
we'll build up a simple base on top

250
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,080
we'll build up a simple base on top
 

251
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,789
we'll build up a simple base on top
using plates and Link together the whole

252
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
using plates and Link together the whole
 

253
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,350
using plates and Link together the whole
thing with

254
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,360

 

255
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,350

ropes now that we got this we just need

256
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:52,360
ropes now that we got this we just need
 

257
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,229
ropes now that we got this we just need
to tie it together with ropes here and

258
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
to tie it together with ropes here and
 

259
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,869
to tie it together with ropes here and
then on every corner and theoretically

260
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:55,879
then on every corner and theoretically
 

261
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,830
then on every corner and theoretically
this top

262
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:56,840
this top
 

263
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,350
this top
part that was legitimate I'm so tired

264
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
part that was legitimate I'm so tired
 

265
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,030
part that was legitimate I'm so tired
theoretically this top part will float

266
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
theoretically this top part will float
 

267
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,630
theoretically this top part will float
so I've cut all these ropes and these

268
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
so I've cut all these ropes and these
 

269
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,350
so I've cut all these ropes and these
just slide onto here so if we hang this

270
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
just slide onto here so if we hang this
 

271
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,149
just slide onto here so if we hang this
top part by these four ropes as you can

272
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:07,159
top part by these four ropes as you can
 

273
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,470
top part by these four ropes as you can
see it doesn't float that's not how it

274
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,480
see it doesn't float that's not how it
 

275
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,190
see it doesn't float that's not how it
works so what we actually have to do is

276
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
works so what we actually have to do is
 

277
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,710
works so what we actually have to do is
take this rope here and tie it onto that

278
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:13,720
take this rope here and tie it onto that
 

279
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,310
take this rope here and tie it onto that
and then once we do that as you can see

280
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
and then once we do that as you can see
 

281
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,670
and then once we do that as you can see
there we have our floating tensity look

282
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:18,680
there we have our floating tensity look
 

283
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,789
there we have our floating tensity look
it's completely floating like just check

284
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
it's completely floating like just check
 

285
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,350
it's completely floating like just check
that out you could float it that's so

286
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,360
that out you could float it that's so
 

287
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,110
that out you could float it that's so
cool and my thought is we could just put

288
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,120
cool and my thought is we could just put
 

289
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,030
cool and my thought is we could just put
each side of the bridge on top of that

290
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,040
each side of the bridge on top of that
 

291
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,310
each side of the bridge on top of that
like that we got to make these arms a

292
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,320
like that we got to make these arms a
 

293
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,749
like that we got to make these arms a
little stronger but that is super

294
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:28,759
little stronger but that is super
 

295
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,990
little stronger but that is super
promising now just build one one more of

296
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
promising now just build one one more of
 

297
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,029
promising now just build one one more of
these and we'll put it on each side of

298
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:31,039
these and we'll put it on each side of
 

299
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,350
these and we'll put it on each side of
the

300
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360

 

301
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,550

bridge I have absolutely no faith in

302
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:35,560
bridge I have absolutely no faith in
 

303
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,270
bridge I have absolutely no faith in
this bridge but we're going to take our

304
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
this bridge but we're going to take our
 

305
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,230
this bridge but we're going to take our
top and just uh put it right on top of

306
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
top and just uh put it right on top of
 

307
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,029
top and just uh put it right on top of
here it's falling apart already guys

308
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:43,039
here it's falling apart already guys
 

309
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,830
here it's falling apart already guys
this is the wobbly Bridge ever so here

310
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
this is the wobbly Bridge ever so here
 

311
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,350
this is the wobbly Bridge ever so here
it is we have our tensity bridge I have

312
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:48,360
it is we have our tensity bridge I have
 

313
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,310
it is we have our tensity bridge I have
no idea how this is going to work I'm

314
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
no idea how this is going to work I'm
 

315
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,629
no idea how this is going to work I'm
not going to put any weight on this one

316
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:51,639
not going to put any weight on this one
 

317
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,830
not going to put any weight on this one
because I don't even think the car will

318
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:52,840
because I don't even think the car will
 

319
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,710
because I don't even think the car will
make it across but we'll grab OT we'll

320
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
make it across but we'll grab OT we'll
 

321
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,629
make it across but we'll grab OT we'll
put him in the passenger side he doesn't

322
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
put him in the passenger side he doesn't
 

323
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,390
put him in the passenger side he doesn't
fit perfectly inside the cars but he

324
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
fit perfectly inside the cars but he
 

325
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,350
fit perfectly inside the cars but he
fits well enough to test and then we'll

326
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,360
fits well enough to test and then we'll
 

327
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,670
fits well enough to test and then we'll
take our hook like that will a bridge

328

use in Lego crash tests it's really fun
 

383
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,029
use in Lego crash tests it's really fun
to build and it's totally posable so you

too that's 10 secrity on to the next

392
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
too that's 10 secrity on to the next

Bridge so the next bridge I want to

394
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:21,479
Bridge so the next bridge I want to
 

395
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,070
Bridge so the next bridge I want to
build is called a trust bridge and the

396
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,080
build is called a trust bridge and the
 

397
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,589
build is called a trust bridge and the
cool thing about this bridge is all the

398
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:24,599
cool thing about this bridge is all the
 

399
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,589
cool thing about this bridge is all the
structure is on top of the bridge so

400
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:26,599
structure is on top of the bridge so
 

401
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:27,710
structure is on top of the bridge so
there's really nothing under it to keep

402
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720
there's really nothing under it to keep
 

403
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,990
there's really nothing under it to keep
it from falling down and the way it

404
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,000
it from falling down and the way it
 

405
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,710
it from falling down and the way it
accomplishes that is by using triangles

406
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
accomplishes that is by using triangles
 

407
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,110
accomplishes that is by using triangles
for example you can see here if I build

408
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,120
for example you can see here if I build
 

409
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,070
for example you can see here if I build
two shapes on the Square all these

410
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
two shapes on the Square all these
 

411
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,589
two shapes on the Square all these
points can actually hinge so when you

412
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:35,599
points can actually hinge so when you
 

413
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,950
points can actually hinge so when you
put pressure on it it collapses but on

414
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:37,960
put pressure on it it collapses but on
 

415
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,629
put pressure on it it collapses but on
the triangle none of these points can

416
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:39,639
the triangle none of these points can
 

417
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,270
the triangle none of these points can
move around so as soon as you apply any

418
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
move around so as soon as you apply any
 

419
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,710
move around so as soon as you apply any
pressure on it it is extremely sturdy

420
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:43,720
pressure on it it is extremely sturdy
 

421
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,350
pressure on it it is extremely sturdy
from any angle so for the trust Bridge

422
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
from any angle so for the trust Bridge
 

423
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,629
from any angle so for the trust Bridge
we're going to combine a bunch of these

424
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
we're going to combine a bunch of these
 

425
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,990
we're going to combine a bunch of these
all the way down which will turn our

426
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
all the way down which will turn our
 

427
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,150
all the way down which will turn our
floppy Bridge into a sturdy structure so

428
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
floppy Bridge into a sturdy structure so
 

429
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,189
floppy Bridge into a sturdy structure so
first I'm just going to build up a quick

430
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
first I'm just going to build up a quick
 

431
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,350
first I'm just going to build up a quick
Road for this and then we'll attach the

432
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,360
Road for this and then we'll attach the
 

433
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,870
Road for this and then we'll attach the
trusses to the sides always like to

434
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:53,880
trusses to the sides always like to
 

435
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,950
trusses to the sides always like to
start these off the same way just a

436
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
start these off the same way just a
 

437
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,990
start these off the same way just a
bunch of 16 x 16 plates which I can lock

438
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,000
bunch of 16 x 16 plates which I can lock
 

439
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,510
bunch of 16 x 16 plates which I can lock
together with

440
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,520
together with
 

441
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,790
together with
tiles you have no idea how loud it is

442
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
tiles you have no idea how loud it is
 

443
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,010
tiles you have no idea how loud it is
when I just have to build all these

444
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,020

 

445
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,749

Bridges so we got our two Bridge pieces

448
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
Bridges so we got our two Bridge pieces
 

449
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,029
Bridges so we got our two Bridge pieces
and now as you can see it's very very

450
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:10,039
and now as you can see it's very very
 

451
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,309
and now as you can see it's very very
floppy so I'm going to line this with

452
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:11,319
floppy so I'm going to line this with
 

453
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,790
floppy so I'm going to line this with
two layers of Technic bricks and then

454
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
two layers of Technic bricks and then
 

455
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,990
two layers of Technic bricks and then
I'll add some to the sides as well so we

456
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll add some to the sides as well so we
 

457
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,550
I'll add some to the sides as well so we
can attach the trusses and then as you

458
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:15,560
can attach the trusses and then as you
 

459
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,670
can attach the trusses and then as you
can see what it's doing is it's just

460
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:16,680
can see what it's doing is it's just
 

461
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,869
can see what it's doing is it's just
coming up right there so the whole point

462
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:17,879
coming up right there so the whole point
 

463
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,110
coming up right there so the whole point
of using these is we need to connect

464
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
of using these is we need to connect
 

465
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,510
of using these is we need to connect
them so what I like to do just grab some

466
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:20,520
them so what I like to do just grab some
 

467
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,589
them so what I like to do just grab some
of these three long pins and then since

468
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:22,599
of these three long pins and then since
 

469
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,710
of these three long pins and then since
we're already connected to the plates I

470
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:23,720
we're already connected to the plates I
 

471
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,150
we're already connected to the plates I
just like to push it

472
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,160
just like to push it
 

473
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,430
just like to push it
through from the outside sometimes I use

474
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
through from the outside sometimes I use
 

475
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,029
through from the outside sometimes I use
my hammer and you just got to make sure

476
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
my hammer and you just got to make sure
 

477
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,469
my hammer and you just got to make sure
you put four four in each brick so that

478
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
you put four four in each brick so that
 

479
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,150
you put four four in each brick so that
it has two points of connection on each

480
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
it has two points of connection on each
 

481
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,510
it has two points of connection on each
thing just got to do this all the way

482
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:38,520

 

483
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,510

down so now we need to integrate these

484
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,520
down so now we need to integrate these
 

485
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,990
down so now we need to integrate these
Technic bricks onto the sides here and

486
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
Technic bricks onto the sides here and
 

487
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,350
Technic bricks onto the sides here and
while we could just do that it probably

488
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
while we could just do that it probably
 

489
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,430
while we could just do that it probably
should cuz it'll be easier I want to

490
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,440
should cuz it'll be easier I want to
 

491
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,589
should cuz it'll be easier I want to
cover up all these colored things so I'm

492
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
cover up all these colored things so I'm
 

493
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,990
cover up all these colored things so I'm
going to use some bricks and then we'll

494
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,000
going to use some bricks and then we'll
 

495
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,189
going to use some bricks and then we'll
sandwich our Technic brick like that and

496
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
sandwich our Technic brick like that and
 

497
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,110
sandwich our Technic brick like that and
that'll give us a way to attach the

498
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,120
that'll give us a way to attach the
 

499
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,350
that'll give us a way to attach the
trusses inside there which should make

500
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
trusses inside there which should make
 

501
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,149
trusses inside there which should make
it pretty

502
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:54,159

 

503
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,309

strong so now we got our Bridge built up

504
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
strong so now we got our Bridge built up
 

505
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,149
strong so now we got our Bridge built up
and as you can see it is very wobbly

506
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:58,159
and as you can see it is very wobbly
 

507
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,270
and as you can see it is very wobbly
let's build up some trusses so we're

508
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
let's build up some trusses so we're
 

509
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,469
let's build up some trusses so we're
going to take two of these we're just

510
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
going to take two of these we're just
 

511
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,749
going to take two of these we're just
going to connect each end like this and

512
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:02,759
going to connect each end like this and
 

513
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,070
going to connect each end like this and
now we have our triangle structure the

514
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
now we have our triangle structure the
 

515
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,350
now we have our triangle structure the
bottom part of this is going to snap

516
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
bottom part of this is going to snap
 

517
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,070
bottom part of this is going to snap
right into the

518
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,080

 

519
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,830

bridge as you can see the rest of this

520
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
bridge as you can see the rest of this
 

521
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,189
bridge as you can see the rest of this
is bending a lot and this part is just

522
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:12,199
is bending a lot and this part is just
 

523
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,830
is bending a lot and this part is just
totally not so now we just continue this

524
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
totally not so now we just continue this
 

525
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,270
totally not so now we just continue this
technique all the way down on both sides

526
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
technique all the way down on both sides
 

527
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,790
technique all the way down on both sides
and I think that'll really really make

528
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
and I think that'll really really make
 

529
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,070
and I think that'll really really make
this strong check that out you can see

530
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,080
this strong check that out you can see
 

531
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,629
this strong check that out you can see
here on the top layer I'm just adding a

532
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
here on the top layer I'm just adding a
 

533
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,110
here on the top layer I'm just adding a
single lift arm or a couple that are

534
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,120
single lift arm or a couple that are
 

535
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,149
single lift arm or a couple that are
latched together to lock everything

536
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:28,159

 

537
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,749

together all right check this

538
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:30,759
together all right check this
 

539
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,269
together all right check this
out that is a flat bridge and that is

540
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
out that is a flat bridge and that is
 

541
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,790
out that is a flat bridge and that is
looking really really strong look at

542
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
looking really really strong look at
 

543
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,909
looking really really strong look at
that this one I'm super hopeful for it's

544
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:36,919
that this one I'm super hopeful for it's
 

545
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,949
that this one I'm super hopeful for it's
like the strongest one I built so far

546
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
like the strongest one I built so far
 

547
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,469
like the strongest one I built so far
for this bridge we have the red pickup

548
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
for this bridge we have the red pickup
 

549
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,509
for this bridge we have the red pickup
truck we're going to put it right here

550
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
truck we're going to put it right here
 

551
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,709
truck we're going to put it right here
and then I just built this little thing

552
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
and then I just built this little thing
 

553
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,350
and then I just built this little thing
into the bed so we could put our weights

554
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,360
into the bed so we could put our weights
 

555
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,910
into the bed so we could put our weights
on top I think he'll actually fit in

556
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
on top I think he'll actually fit in
 

557
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,509
on top I think he'll actually fit in
here you guys oh now there's a giant

558
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
here you guys oh now there's a giant
 

559
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,870
here you guys oh now there's a giant
door mechanism in the way well we can

560
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:49,880
door mechanism in the way well we can
 

561
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,509
door mechanism in the way well we can
get half of OT in there I'm pretty

562
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
get half of OT in there I'm pretty
 

563
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,630
get half of OT in there I'm pretty
confident in this one so I'm going to

564
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
confident in this one so I'm going to
 

565
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,269
confident in this one so I'm going to
start it at 10 lbs here we go the trust

566
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:56,279
start it at 10 lbs here we go the trust
 

567
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,790
start it at 10 lbs here we go the trust
bridge is such a cool technique oh it's

568
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:57,800
bridge is such a cool technique oh it's
 

569
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,910
bridge is such a cool technique oh it's
moving will it make it across the only

570
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
moving will it make it across the only
 

571
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,230
moving will it make it across the only
thing I'm a little worried about is the

572
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,240
thing I'm a little worried about is the
 

573
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,430
thing I'm a little worried about is the
plates on the bottom cuz they're 16x 16

574
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
plates on the bottom cuz they're 16x 16
 

575
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,990
plates on the bottom cuz they're 16x 16
plates that's the only weak spot I think

576
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,000
plates that's the only weak spot I think
 

577
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,630
plates that's the only weak spot I think
the sides will stay

578
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
the sides will stay
 

579
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,310
the sides will stay
together I love OT in there just

580
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,320
together I love OT in there just
 

581
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,069
together I love OT in there just
chilling here he goes it's in the middle

582
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:11,079
chilling here he goes it's in the middle
 

583
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,430
chilling here he goes it's in the middle
of the bridge oh it's kind of bending

584
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:12,440
of the bridge oh it's kind of bending
 

585
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,350
of the bridge oh it's kind of bending
right here something's about to snap oh

586
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,360
right here something's about to snap oh
 

587
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,750
right here something's about to snap oh
no oh no no the trusters have come off

588
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
no oh no no the trusters have come off
 

589
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,030
no oh no no the trusters have come off
the side

590
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
the side
 

591
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,710
the side
but did we break the winch no it just

592
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:21,720
but did we break the winch no it just
 

593
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,670
but did we break the winch no it just
came off oh man I'm going to call that a

594
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:24,680
came off oh man I'm going to call that a
 

595
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,069
came off oh man I'm going to call that a
fail there's no way that car was getting

596
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:27,079
fail there's no way that car was getting
 

597
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,870
fail there's no way that car was getting
across after that so hey but honestly lb

598
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:29,880
across after that so hey but honestly lb
 

599
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,350
across after that so hey but honestly lb
took it to the very middle of the bridge

600
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
took it to the very middle of the bridge
 

601
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,990
took it to the very middle of the bridge
and you can see I was just about to say

602
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,000
and you can see I was just about to say
 

603
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,430
and you can see I was just about to say
you can see the triangles haven't broken

604
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:34,440
you can see the triangles haven't broken
 

605
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,430
you can see the triangles haven't broken
but check out the

606
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:36,440
but check out the
 

607
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,389
but check out the
damage BL bl's good half the man he used

608
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:39,399
damage BL bl's good half the man he used
 

609
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,590
damage BL bl's good half the man he used
to be yeah you can see the plates and

610
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
to be yeah you can see the plates and
 

611
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,269
to be yeah you can see the plates and
the tiles just snapped here and then

612
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
the tiles just snapped here and then
 

613
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,870
the tiles just snapped here and then
these came off the sides but it worked

614
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
these came off the sides but it worked
 

615
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,230
these came off the sides but it worked
pretty well so that's a trust bridge for

616
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
pretty well so that's a trust bridge for
 

617
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,590
pretty well so that's a trust bridge for
you the next one though is going to

618
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
you the next one though is going to
 

619
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,790
you the next one though is going to
actually use motors to work so let's

620
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:49,800
actually use motors to work so let's
 

621
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,509
actually use motors to work so let's
check out that one so the next bridge I

622
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
check out that one so the next bridge I
 

623
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,990
check out that one so the next bridge I
want to build is a draw bridge which is

624
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,000
want to build is a draw bridge which is
 

625
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,829
want to build is a draw bridge which is
basically just a bridge that opens up

626
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:54,839
basically just a bridge that opens up
 

627
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,310
basically just a bridge that opens up
that way ships can go underneath it so I

628
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
that way ships can go underneath it so I
 

629
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,710
that way ships can go underneath it so I
think I'm going to repurpose our winch

630
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:57,720
think I'm going to repurpose our winch
 

631
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,590
think I'm going to repurpose our winch
system and build a couple more of these

632
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
system and build a couple more of these
 

633
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,069
system and build a couple more of these
for each side so we'll basically have a

634
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:01,079
for each side so we'll basically have a
 

635
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,509
for each side so we'll basically have a
base with a large tower that comes up

636
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:02,519
base with a large tower that comes up
 

637
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,790
base with a large tower that comes up
and then we'll have a rope attached to

638
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:03,800
and then we'll have a rope attached to
 

639
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,550
and then we'll have a rope attached to
that that'll actually bring up the other

640
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:05,560
that that'll actually bring up the other
 

641
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,230
that that'll actually bring up the other
side of the bridge I'm kind of Unsure

642
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:07,240
side of the bridge I'm kind of Unsure
 

643
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,630
side of the bridge I'm kind of Unsure
how we're going to make this hold up the

644
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
how we're going to make this hold up the
 

645
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,829
how we're going to make this hold up the
weight in the middle so let's start by

646
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
weight in the middle so let's start by
 

647
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:17,269
weight in the middle so let's start by
building a

648
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279

 

649
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,670

base guys big brain move so there's

650
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
base guys big brain move so there's
 

651
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,910
base guys big brain move so there's
going to be so much weight on the center

652
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:20,920
going to be so much weight on the center
 

653
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,150
going to be so much weight on the center
of the bridge and we don't want it to

654
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
of the bridge and we don't want it to
 

655
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,509
of the bridge and we don't want it to
collapse since it's not attached we're

656
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
collapse since it's not attached we're
 

657
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,069
collapse since it's not attached we're
going to put weights on the edges to

658
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:25,079
going to put weights on the edges to
 

659
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,430
going to put weights on the edges to
kind of counterweight it so we'll build

660
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:26,440
kind of counterweight it so we'll build
 

661
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,230
kind of counterweight it so we'll build
like 10 lb in each side of this and that

662
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
like 10 lb in each side of this and that
 

663
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,550
like 10 lb in each side of this and that
should at least give it a good chance

664
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:33,560

 

665
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,790

now to make the bridge actually able to

666
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
now to make the bridge actually able to
 

667
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,069
now to make the bridge actually able to
attach to this what I'm going to do is

668
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
attach to this what I'm going to do is
 

669
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,509
attach to this what I'm going to do is
integrate some Technic bricks in the

670
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
integrate some Technic bricks in the
 

671
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,590
integrate some Technic bricks in the
sides here there we go and then we build

672
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
sides here there we go and then we build
 

673
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,829
sides here there we go and then we build
up the bridge we'll just make sure to

674
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:40,839
up the bridge we'll just make sure to
 

675
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,750
up the bridge we'll just make sure to
include some techn connections on it now

676
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:42,760
include some techn connections on it now
 

677
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,269
include some techn connections on it now
for the actual Tower structure I think

678
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:44,279
for the actual Tower structure I think
 

679
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,790
for the actual Tower structure I think
I'm going to build up two long arms at a

680
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm going to build up two long arms at a
 

681
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,030
I'm going to build up two long arms at a
technic brick kind of like I did for the

682
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
technic brick kind of like I did for the
 

683
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,430
technic brick kind of like I did for the
tensegrity that way we can mount the

684
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:48,440
tensegrity that way we can mount the
 

685
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,829
tensegrity that way we can mount the
winch system to the

686
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:54,839

 

687
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,509

top this may not be pretty but it will

688
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
top this may not be pretty but it will
 

689
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,949
top this may not be pretty but it will
be functional you got to build up one

690
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
be functional you got to build up one
 

691
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,629
be functional you got to build up one
more of those on this

692
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:01,639
more of those on this
 

693
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,590
more of those on this
side so to make the winch on this thing

694
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
side so to make the winch on this thing
 

695
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,949
side so to make the winch on this thing
so it actually works I'm going to use a

696
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
so it actually works I'm going to use a
 

697
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,230
so it actually works I'm going to use a
worm gear we should be able to feed an

698
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
worm gear we should be able to feed an
 

699
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,790
worm gear we should be able to feed an
axle through somewhere to a motor to get

700
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:07,800
axle through somewhere to a motor to get
 

701
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,790
axle through somewhere to a motor to get
that motorized sh this long axle

702
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:11,800
that motorized sh this long axle
 

703
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,269
that motorized sh this long axle
through see now we take these guys and

704
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
through see now we take these guys and
 

705
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,269
through see now we take these guys and
go through just like that and we should

706
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
go through just like that and we should
 

707
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,470
go through just like that and we should
be able to connect this

708
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
be able to connect this
 

709
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,670
be able to connect this
that okay that piece goes there now we

710
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:22,680
that okay that piece goes there now we
 

711
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,230
that okay that piece goes there now we
turn this on this thing spins and we'll

712
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,240
turn this on this thing spins and we'll
 

713
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,550
turn this on this thing spins and we'll
make our winch actually pull something

714
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
make our winch actually pull something
 

715
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,350
make our winch actually pull something
up now we need to attach two ropes to

716
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:28,360
up now we need to attach two ropes to
 

717
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,910
up now we need to attach two ropes to
this axle and then once we attach it to

718
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
this axle and then once we attach it to
 

719
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,550
this axle and then once we attach it to
the bridge we will have a functioning

720
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:31,560
the bridge we will have a functioning
 

721
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,190
the bridge we will have a functioning
draw bridge last thing before we connect

722
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
draw bridge last thing before we connect
 

723
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,910
draw bridge last thing before we connect
this all together is just the bridge

724
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:34,920
this all together is just the bridge
 

725
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,509
this all together is just the bridge
part the important part and then

726
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:36,519
part the important part and then
 

727
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,389

specifically because I want to and not

728
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
specifically because I want to and not
 

729
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,670
specifically because I want to and not
because they make base plates in that

730
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
because they make base plates in that
 

731
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,750
because they make base plates in that
color we're going to use green and once

732
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
color we're going to use green and once
 

733
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,910
color we're going to use green and once
we got our Technic bricks and our base

734
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:42,920
we got our Technic bricks and our base
 

735
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,150
we got our Technic bricks and our base
plates in place we just need to lock

736
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
plates in place we just need to lock
 

737
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,710
plates in place we just need to lock
down a bunch of bricks on top of it and

738
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:45,720
down a bunch of bricks on top of it and
 

739
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,069
down a bunch of bricks on top of it and
add some Technic in the middle to make

740
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:47,079
add some Technic in the middle to make
 

741
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,670
add some Technic in the middle to make
it strong so it doesn't fold guys leave

742
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:48,680
it strong so it doesn't fold guys leave
 

743
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,190
it strong so it doesn't fold guys leave
a like if you appreciate how many bricks

744
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,200
a like if you appreciate how many bricks

I've had to place this video honestly

746
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:52,279
I've had to place this video honestly
 

747
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,590
I've had to place this video honestly
it's kind of normal for the tips of my

748
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
it's kind of normal for the tips of my
 

749
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,910
it's kind of normal for the tips of my
fingers to have little indentations

750
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:54,920
fingers to have little indentations
 

751
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,230
fingers to have little indentations
where the studs are it's so much fun

752
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
where the studs are it's so much fun
 

753
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,430
where the studs are it's so much fun
though

754
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:06,440

 

755
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,590

all right we got the first one done up

756
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
all right we got the first one done up
 

757
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,110
all right we got the first one done up
here I'm thinking it might work all I

758
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
here I'm thinking it might work all I
 

759
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,230
here I'm thinking it might work all I
got to do is duplicate this and we'll

760
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
got to do is duplicate this and we'll
 

761
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,470
got to do is duplicate this and we'll
test it

762
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:11,480
test it
 

763
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,389
test it
out we're going to put our weights on

764
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:13,399
out we're going to put our weights on
 

765
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,110
out we're going to put our weights on
the inside of this here so we're going

766
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
the inside of this here so we're going
 

767
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,710
the inside of this here so we're going
to do 20 lbs in each now with those

768
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:17,720
to do 20 lbs in each now with those
 

769
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,069
to do 20 lbs in each now with those
weights in

770
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
weights in
 

771
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,790
weights in
place so sus all we have to do is just

772
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
place so sus all we have to do is just
 

773
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,230
place so sus all we have to do is just
use this little remote and that tells

774
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
use this little remote and that tells
 

775
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,750
use this little remote and that tells
the IR receivers in the winches to

776
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
the IR receivers in the winches to
 

777
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,150
the IR receivers in the winches to
unravel it

778
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
unravel it
 

779
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,430
unravel it
nice

780
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440

 

781
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,230

hey boom here we go the next vehicle we

782
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
hey boom here we go the next vehicle we
 

783
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,189
hey boom here we go the next vehicle we
have for this is the Porsche convertible

784
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:36,199
have for this is the Porsche convertible
 

785
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,069
have for this is the Porsche convertible
it's convertible now because I had to

786
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
it's convertible now because I had to
 

787
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,350
it's convertible now because I had to
take the top off to put the weight thing

788
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
take the top off to put the weight thing
 

789
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,870
take the top off to put the weight thing
on we're going to put OT inside like

790
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:41,880
on we're going to put OT inside like
 

791
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,710
on we're going to put OT inside like
this and what I'm going to do is just

792
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:43,720
this and what I'm going to do is just
 

793
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,430
this and what I'm going to do is just
put this up slightly on each side that

794
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
put this up slightly on each side that
 

795
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,590
put this up slightly on each side that
way when it gets to the middle I'm

796
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:46,600
way when it gets to the middle I'm
 

797
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,189
way when it gets to the middle I'm
hoping the tension will push these down

798
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:48,199
hoping the tension will push these down
 

799
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:50,430
hoping the tension will push these down
enough to whe to be flat but it won't

800
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:50,440
enough to whe to be flat but it won't
 

801
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,629
enough to whe to be flat but it won't
break and now you just clip this

802
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
break and now you just clip this
 

803
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,189
break and now you just clip this
underneath the car for this one I'm

804
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:54,199
underneath the car for this one I'm
 

805
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:57,870
underneath the car for this one I'm
going to start with 2.5 lb here we go

806
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:57,880
going to start with 2.5 lb here we go
 

807
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,389
going to start with 2.5 lb here we go
start winding it up it'll go across I

808
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
start winding it up it'll go across I
 

809
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,470
start winding it up it'll go across I
think it might be able to make it over

810
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:01,480
think it might be able to make it over
 

811
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,150
think it might be able to make it over
the Gap but I'm a little nervous that it

812
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,160
the Gap but I'm a little nervous that it
 

813
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,870
the Gap but I'm a little nervous that it
just won't line up right oh no it's

814
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
just won't line up right oh no it's
 

815
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,949
just won't line up right oh no it's
creaking it's going down come on you can

816
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:07,959
creaking it's going down come on you can
 

817
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:15,389
creaking it's going down come on you can
do it you can do it

818
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:15,399

 

819
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,509

no it's still going wait it can bring it

820
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:18,519
no it's still going wait it can bring it
 

821
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,629
no it's still going wait it can bring it
out of the water it's pulling it out of

822
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
out of the water it's pulling it out of
 

823
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,189
out of the water it's pulling it out of
the water well I mean to be perfectly

824
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:23,199
the water well I mean to be perfectly
 

825
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,430
the water well I mean to be perfectly
honest half of it still there so there's

826
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:26,440
honest half of it still there so there's
 

827
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,590
honest half of it still there so there's
that there it goes dude this winch is

828
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
that there it goes dude this winch is
 

829
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,350
that there it goes dude this winch is
awesome this is so

830
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
awesome this is so
 

831
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,030
awesome this is so
cool

832
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
cool
 

833
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,269
cool
hey all right we made it across the

834
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
hey all right we made it across the
 

835
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,269
hey all right we made it across the
bridge but half of it fell so

836
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
bridge but half of it fell so
 

837
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,910
bridge but half of it fell so
technically it's a fail some would say

838
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:38,920
technically it's a fail some would say
 

839
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,910
technically it's a fail some would say
I'm a failure this bridge is half

840
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:40,920
I'm a failure this bridge is half
 

841
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,870
I'm a failure this bridge is half
successful you guys and my favorite car

842
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
successful you guys and my favorite car
 

843
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,350
successful you guys and my favorite car
is still alive which is the best part

844
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,360
is still alive which is the best part
 

845
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,910
is still alive which is the best part
let's build the next one the next bridge

846
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
let's build the next one the next bridge
 

847
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,509
let's build the next one the next bridge
I want to build is a suspension bridge

848
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
I want to build is a suspension bridge
 

849
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,790
I want to build is a suspension bridge
the Golden Gate Bridge is actually a

850
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
the Golden Gate Bridge is actually a
 

851
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,230
the Golden Gate Bridge is actually a
suspension bridge it's basically just a

852
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
suspension bridge it's basically just a
 

853
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,910
suspension bridge it's basically just a
long road with pillars in the middle and

854
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
long road with pillars in the middle and
 

855
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,470
long road with pillars in the middle and
then reverse arches that are all

856
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:53,480
then reverse arches that are all
 

857
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,550
then reverse arches that are all
connected to hold the bridge together so

858
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:55,560
connected to hold the bridge together so
 

859
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,670
connected to hold the bridge together so
first I'm going to build a road with

860
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:56,680
first I'm going to build a road with
 

861
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,269
first I'm going to build a road with
Technic bricks along the sides like we

862
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:58,279
Technic bricks along the sides like we
 

863
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,749
Technic bricks along the sides like we
did for the last one and that's really

864
00:13:59,749 --> 00:13:59,759
did for the last one and that's really
 

865
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,749
did for the last one and that's really
easy and then we're going to build the

866
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:01,759
easy and then we're going to build the
 

867
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,189
easy and then we're going to build the
suspension arches which we'll have to

868
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
suspension arches which we'll have to
 

869
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,829
suspension arches which we'll have to
attach to two large pillars I'm just

870
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:04,839
attach to two large pillars I'm just
 

871
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:05,509
attach to two large pillars I'm just
going to do what I did for the

872
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
going to do what I did for the
 

873
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,550
going to do what I did for the
drawbridge basically build two long

874
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:07,560
drawbridge basically build two long
 

875
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,150
drawbridge basically build two long
pillars that come up out of Technic what

876
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
pillars that come up out of Technic what
 

877
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,310
pillars that come up out of Technic what
I'm doing here is just building up a

878
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm doing here is just building up a
 

879
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,629
I'm doing here is just building up a
shell on the outside of the Technic

880
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:13,639
shell on the outside of the Technic
 

881
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,389
shell on the outside of the Technic
structure that way it'll be a lot

882
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:15,399
structure that way it'll be a lot
 

883
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:22,110
structure that way it'll be a lot
stronger I ran out of red Technic bricks

884
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,120

 

885
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,189

so my thought is we just build it down a

886
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:24,199
so my thought is we just build it down a
 

887
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,670
so my thought is we just build it down a
little bit further and that will attach

888
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
little bit further and that will attach
 

889
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,030
little bit further and that will attach
to the legs which will just go

890
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,040
to the legs which will just go
 

891
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,670
to the legs which will just go
underneath

892
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680

 

893
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,230

so as you can see this is uh a little

894
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,240
so as you can see this is uh a little
 

895
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,629
so as you can see this is uh a little
bit wobbly which the whole point of

896
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
bit wobbly which the whole point of
 

897
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,269
bit wobbly which the whole point of
suspension bridge we actually make it so

898
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:36,279
suspension bridge we actually make it so
 

899
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,829
suspension bridge we actually make it so
it's not wobbly

900
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
it's not wobbly
 

901
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,030
it's not wobbly
anymore what we're going to do is use a

902
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,040
anymore what we're going to do is use a
 

903
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,269
anymore what we're going to do is use a
bunch of these Technic lift arms and

904
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:42,279
bunch of these Technic lift arms and
 

905
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,230
bunch of these Technic lift arms and
attach them to the sides to make ropes

906
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
attach them to the sides to make ropes
 

907
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,949
attach them to the sides to make ropes
that will Arch around and go to the

908
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:45,959
that will Arch around and go to the
 

909
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,310
that will Arch around and go to the
other side and we just snap all these

910
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,320
other side and we just snap all these
 

911
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,629
other side and we just snap all these
together with these little Technic

912
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639

 

913
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,670

pins look we're getting the triangle

914
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:52,680
pins look we're getting the triangle
 

915
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,590
pins look we're getting the triangle
shape again that is how triangles

916
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:56,600

 

917
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,790

work okay now that we have the Arches on

918
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
work okay now that we have the Arches on
 

919
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,389
work okay now that we have the Arches on
there my thought is we just literally

920
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
there my thought is we just literally
 

921
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,629
there my thought is we just literally
take some lift arms and attach them at

922
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
take some lift arms and attach them at
 

923
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,069
take some lift arms and attach them at
different intervals if we grab some Lego

924
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
different intervals if we grab some Lego
 

925
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,550
different intervals if we grab some Lego
axles you can actually put these on the

926
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:05,560
axles you can actually put these on the
 

927
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,189
axles you can actually put these on the
inside of These

928
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199

 

929
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,230

Bricks now we're getting something going

930
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:11,240
Bricks now we're getting something going
 

931
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,949
Bricks now we're getting something going
there check it out I think the looseness

932
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
there check it out I think the looseness
 

933
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,509
there check it out I think the looseness
of these Technic bricks is going to be a

934
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:14,519
of these Technic bricks is going to be a
 

935
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,430
of these Technic bricks is going to be a
problem because these can literally just

936
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:16,440
problem because these can literally just
 

937
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,629
problem because these can literally just
pull up so we're going to need to put

938
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:17,639
pull up so we're going to need to put
 

939
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,150
pull up so we're going to need to put
another layer of bricks over that and

940
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,160
another layer of bricks over that and
 

941
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,670
another layer of bricks over that and
then build it up on the sides but I

942
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:20,680
then build it up on the sides but I
 

943
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,829
then build it up on the sides but I
think once we get that locked down it

944
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
think once we get that locked down it
 

945
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,550
think once we get that locked down it
should be a lot stronger and hopefully

946
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:23,560
should be a lot stronger and hopefully
 

947
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,829
should be a lot stronger and hopefully
when we put it over the pool it'll

948
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
when we put it over the pool it'll
 

949
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,389
when we put it over the pool it'll
actually hold

950
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
actually hold
 

951
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,069
actually hold
together all right and now that we have

952
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
together all right and now that we have
 

953
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,189
together all right and now that we have
the structure of our Bridge all we got

954
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
the structure of our Bridge all we got
 

955
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,670
the structure of our Bridge all we got
to do is build two pillars down to the

956
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:30,680
to do is build two pillars down to the
 

957
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,069
to do is build two pillars down to the
floor under these two

958
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:35,079

 

959
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,309
