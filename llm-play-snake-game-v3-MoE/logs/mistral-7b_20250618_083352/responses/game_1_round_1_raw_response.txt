 {
      "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP"],
      "reasoning": "The snake is initially at (5,5) and needs to move two units to the right and then one unit up to reach the apple at (7,5). This path avoids any initial collisions with walls or body segments and ensures the snake does not hug walls unnecessarily. It also ensures that after eating the apple, the snake will be able to make a legal move next turn since it is not moving into the cell the tail will vacate when it does not move (eating an apple)."
