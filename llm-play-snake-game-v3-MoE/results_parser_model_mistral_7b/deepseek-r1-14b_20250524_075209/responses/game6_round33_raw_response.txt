========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how the snake can move from (0,0) to eat the apple at (1,7). 

First, I'll look at the current state. The head is at (0,0), and the direction is LEFT. But wait, moving left from (0,0) isn't possible because x would become -1, which is out of bounds. So that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial state. Oh, no—the current direction is LEFT, but the head is at (0,0), so if it moves left, it'll die immediately. So the first move can't be LEFT because that would cause a collision with the wall.

So, the snake's current body includes [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]. That means the snake is extending upwards from (0,0) along the same x-coordinate. So the head is at (0,0), and behind it are cells moving to the right.

The apple is at (1,7). The goal is to get there safely without colliding with the body or going out of bounds. 

Let me think about the possible directions the snake can move first. Since the current direction is LEFT, which would take it into a wall if moved, the next move can't be DOWN because that's the reverse direction (since LEFT's opposite is RIGHT? Wait no—LEFT and RIGHT are opposites. So from LEFT, you can't go RIGHT. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up directions. Let me clarify: UP and DOWN are opposites; LEFT and RIGHT are opposites.

Wait, in movement rules, it says cannot reverse direction. If current direction is "UP", you can't choose "DOWN" next. So if the current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT. So first move options are UP or DOWN.

But let's check the initial position: head at (0,0), which is bottom-left corner. Moving UP would take it to (0,1). Moving DOWN isn't possible because y=0 is the minimum; moving down would take it to (0,-1) which is out of bounds, so that's invalid.

So the first move must be UP or LEFT? Wait no—current direction is LEFT, but initial position at (0,0), moving LEFT is impossible. So from current direction LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing. So allowed moves are UP and DOWN. But DOWN would go out of bounds, so only possible move is UP.

Wait, that seems like a problem. Because if the snake's head is at (0,0) facing LEFT, then moving UP is possible but moving LEFT isn't. So first move must be UP.

So let's plan:

Move 1: UP to (0,1). Now the new head is (0,1), and we check for collisions. The body after this move would shift, so the tail would stay if it's an apple or not. Wait, in this case, the apple is at (1,7), which isn't the same as (0,1) yet, so no growth.

So after moving UP, the head is at (0,1). The body cells will update by adding the old head (0,0) to the front of the body list and then removing the tail. So the new body would be [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] because we add (0,0) at the front and remove the last element (1,4). 

Wait no—original body is [ (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) ]. After moving UP, new head is (0,1). So the new body becomes [(0,0)] + original body except tail. Wait, no—the movement rule says:

After inserting old head at front of BODY, if not eating apple, remove the last element.

So initial body after move: insert (0,0) at front → [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) ], then remove tail (1,4) since not eating apple. So new body is [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ].

Wait that seems correct. Now the full snake S would be [(0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]?

Wait no: after inserting old head at front of body list and removing tail if not eating apple. So initial body is [ (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) ].

After moving UP to (0,1):

- Insert old head (0,0) at front → new BODY becomes [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) ]

- Since not eating apple, remove tail: [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]

So the new snake is head at (0,1), body at [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ].

Now, next move: direction was LEFT, so can't choose RIGHT. So possible moves are UP and DOWN? Wait, current direction after first move is now UP?

Wait no—the movement rule says that each move's new head is computed based on the chosen direction. But the current direction for the next move depends on what we choose.

Wait, in the initial state, the current direction is LEFT. So the first move must be either UP or DOWN (can't reverse to RIGHT). After moving UP, the new direction becomes UP. Then, the next moves have to follow the same rule: can't reverse from the previous direction.

So let's proceed step by step.

Move 1: UP → head at (0,1), body as [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]

Now, next move must not be DOWN because current direction is UP. So allowed moves are LEFT and RIGHT.

But wait, can't reverse: from UP, can't choose DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait no—NONE is only when the snake hasn't moved yet. So after first move, direction becomes whatever we choose next.

So for the second move, since current direction is UP, can't choose DOWN. So options are LEFT, RIGHT.

Let's think: from (0,1), moving LEFT would take head to (-1,1) which is invalid. So only possible move is RIGHT or UP?

Wait no—current position after first move is (0,1). From here:

- UP → (0,2)
- DOWN → (0,0) but that's the next body cell, which would cause collision unless it's the tail.
- LEFT → (-1,1) invalid
- RIGHT → (1,1)

Wait, current direction is UP. So for second move, can't choose DOWN.

So possible moves are LEFT and RIGHT, but LEFT is invalid because x=0 can't go left. So only possible move is RIGHT to (1,1).

But wait, the body after first move includes (1,0), which is one cell below the new head position (0,1). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake should turn right after moving up once. Let's think about this.

After first move to (0,1), we're at (0,1). The body now includes (0,0) as the next segment, which is directly below the head. So if we choose to go DOWN from here, that would take us back to (0,0), but since the tail hasn't moved yet, and it's part of the body except for when the tail moves. Wait, no—the collision condition says that new_head can't coincide with any BODYi except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

Wait, in the movement rules: after computing new_head, check collisions using the state before body shifts. So if the new head is at (0,0), which was previously part of the body, but since the body hasn't moved yet, that would be a collision because it's still present except for when the tail moves.

Wait no, in this case, after moving to (0,1), the body becomes [ (0,0), (1,0), ... ] so the new head is at (0,1). If next move is DOWN, that would take it back to (0,0), which is now the first segment of the body. So collision occurs because new_head coincides with a BODYi (since the state before shifting hasn't removed anything yet).

So moving DOWN from (0,1) would cause a collision with (0,0). Therefore, can't move DOWN.

Thus, after moving UP to (0,1), next possible moves are RIGHT and LEFT. But LEFT is invalid as it's out of bounds. So must choose RIGHT.

Move 2: RIGHT → head at (1,1). Now check for collision with body before shifting. The current body is [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]?

Wait no—the body after first move was [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]. So the new head is at (1,1). But in the body, there's already a segment at (1,1). So moving to (1,1) would cause collision with that segment.

Wait, no. Wait, when we insert the old head into the body list after each move. Let me clarify:

After first move (UP), new head is (0,1), and the body becomes [ (0,0) ] + original body except last element. So original body was [ (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) ]. After inserting (0,0) at front, it's [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) ], then remove last element because not eating apple → new body is [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ].

So in the next move, when considering moving to (1,1), which is already part of the body at index 2. So collision would occur because new_head is (1,1) and it's present in BODYi before shifting.

Therefore, can't move RIGHT from (0,1).

Hmm, this seems like a dead end. Maybe I made a mistake in planning the first move.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that first move must be UP is incorrect because of the body positions. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps moving DOWN isn't possible because it's out of bounds. So only possible first move is UP to (0,1). Then next moves have to navigate around the body.

But as we saw, moving RIGHT from (0,1) would cause collision with existing body at (1,1). So what other options are there?

Wait, perhaps after moving UP to (0,1), the snake can turn LEFT? But wait, can't choose LEFT because it's invalid. Or is it possible?

No—because moving LEFT from (0,1) would take x to -1, which is invalid.

So seems like after first move to (0,1), only option is to move UP again to (0,2).

But let's check if that works.

Move 2: UP → head at (0,2). Check collision: current body before shifting is [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ].

New_head is (0,2). Does it collide with any of the BODYi? Let's see:

BODY has (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).

So new_head (0,2) doesn't collide with any of these. So that's safe.

Now, update body: insert old head (0,1) at front → [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ], then remove tail if not eating apple. Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element → new body is [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) ].

So now the snake is head at (0,2), followed by [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) ].

Now, next move: current direction was UP. So can't choose DOWN as next move.

Possible moves: LEFT and RIGHT.

From (0,2), moving LEFT is invalid because x=0. Moving RIGHT to (1,2). Check collision:

Current body before shifting is [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) ].

New_head would be (1,2), which is already the last segment of the body. But since we're moving to it, would that cause a collision?

Wait, according to collision rules: after computing new_head, check if it's in BODYi before shifting.

In this case, new_head is (1,2). The current body includes (1,2) as its last element. So yes, new_head coincides with a BODYi → collision occurs. Therefore, can't move RIGHT.

So stuck again. Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the first move should be to the right? But initial direction was LEFT, which isn't possible because x=0. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait no—the current direction is LEFT, meaning that if you choose a different direction, it's allowed except for RIGHT (since they're opposites).

Wait, movement rule says can't reverse direction. So from LEFT, you can't go to RIGHT. But initial position at (0,0) facing LEFT makes moving LEFT invalid. So first move must be UP or DOWN.

But as we saw, moving DOWN is invalid because it's out of bounds, so only UP remains.

This seems like a tricky situation. Maybe I should consider that the snake can't proceed without changing direction earlier, but perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe after moving UP once, the next move should be RIGHT, even though it causes collision with (1,1), because the body hasn't shifted yet. Wait no—collision is checked before shifting, so if new_head is in any BODYi, including those that will be shifted, then it's a collision.

Wait no—the movement rule says: check collisions using the state before body shifts. So when moving to (1,1), you look at the current body before inserting old head and removing tail. In this case, after first move, the body is [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]. So new_head (1,1) is present in the BODYi → collision.

Therefore, can't move there.

So perhaps the only way to proceed is by moving UP again. Let's see:

Move 2: UP → (0,2). Body after this becomes [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) ].

Now, next move can't be DOWN because current direction is UP. So options are LEFT and RIGHT.

From (0,2):

- Moving LEFT invalid
- Moving RIGHT to (1,2). Check collision: in current body before shifting [ (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) ], new_head is (1,2), which is present → collision.

So can't move there.

Thus, seems like a dead end again. Maybe the snake needs to make a U-turn or something else.

Wait, perhaps after moving UP once and then making another move.

Alternatively, maybe I need to plan multiple moves ahead.

The goal is (1,7). So we're at (0,2) after two moves. Need to get to x=1 and y=7. Maybe the snake should start moving right once it can.

But given the body's position, perhaps we need to move up several times first to get away from the initial column, then turn right.

Let me try:

Move 1: UP → (0,1)
Move 2: UP → (0,2)
Move 3: UP → (0,3)

Now, at (0,3), body is [ (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) ]

Next move can't be DOWN because current direction is UP. So options are LEFT and RIGHT.

From (0,3):

- Moving LEFT invalid
- Moving RIGHT to (1,3). Check collision: in body before shifting [ (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) ], new_head is (1,3). Not present → no collision. So safe.

So move 4: RIGHT → (1,3). Now, update body:

Insert old head (0,3) at front → [ (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) ], then remove tail if not eating apple. Since not eating, remove last element → new body is [ (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0) ].

Now, head at (1,3). Next move: current direction was RIGHT, so can't choose LEFT next.

From (1,3), possible moves are UP and DOWN. But current direction is RIGHT; can't choose LEFT. So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or NONE? Wait no—current direction after moving RIGHT becomes RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT.

Wait, no—the movement rule says you can't reverse from the previous direction. If you were going RIGHT, you can't go LEFT next.

So possible moves: UP and DOWN.

Let's check:

Move 5: UP → (1,4). Check collision with body before shifting [ (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0) ]. New_head is (1,4). Not present → safe.

Proceeding up to (1,4):

Move 5: UP → (1,4)

Body becomes:

Insert old head (1,3) at front → [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0) ], then remove tail (1,0) since not eating apple. So new body is [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) ].

Now at (1,4). Next move can't be DOWN because current direction was UP; can't reverse to DOWN? Wait no—the previous direction was UP, so next can't be DOWN. So allowed directions are LEFT and RIGHT.

Wait no: the rule is you can't reverse direction. So if last move was UP, you can't go DOWN next. So possible moves are LEFT and RIGHT.

From (1,4), moving LEFT to (0,4). Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) ]. New_head is (0,4). Not present → safe.

So move 6: LEFT → (0,4)

Update body:

Insert old head (1,4) at front → [ (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) ], then remove tail (0,0). New body is [ (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) ].

Now at (0,4). Next move can't be RIGHT because last direction was LEFT. So allowed moves: UP and DOWN.

Move 7: UP → (0,5)

Check collision: body before shifting [ (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) ]. New_head is (0,5). Not present → safe.

Proceeding to (0,5):

Move 7: UP

Body becomes:

Insert old head (0,4) at front → [ (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) ], remove tail (0,1). New body [ (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2) ].

Now at (0,5). Next move can't be DOWN. So options: LEFT and RIGHT.

But from (0,5), moving LEFT is invalid. So must move RIGHT to (1,5).

Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2) ]. New_head (1,5). Not present → safe.

Move 8: RIGHT → (1,5)

Update body:

Insert old head (0,5) at front → [ (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2) ], remove tail (0,2). New body [ (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3) ].

Now at (1,5). Next move can't be LEFT. So options: UP and DOWN.

Move 9: UP → (1,6)

Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3) ]. New_head (1,6). Not present → safe.

Proceeding to (1,6):

Move 9: UP

Body becomes:

Insert old head (1,5) at front → [ (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3) ], remove tail (0,3). New body [ (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3) ].

Now at (1,6). Next move can't be DOWN. So options: LEFT and RIGHT.

Move 10: UP → (1,7)

Wait, from (1,6), moving UP to (1,7):

Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3) ]. New_head is (1,7). Not present → safe.

So move 10: UP → (1,7)

Update body:

Insert old head (1,6) at front → [ (1,6), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3) ], remove tail (1,3). New body [ (1,6), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4) ].

Now at destination (1,7). So it took 10 moves.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, perhaps the snake could have turned earlier to reach faster.

Wait, but each move is just one step, so this seems like the minimal number given the constraints.

Alternatively, let me recount:

Moves:

1. UP → (0,1)

2. UP → (0,2)

3. UP → (0,3)

4. RIGHT → (1,3)

5. UP → (1,4)

6. LEFT → (0,4)

7. UP → (0,5)

8. RIGHT → (1,5)

9. UP → (1,6)

10. UP → (1,7)

Yes, 10 moves.

But I think I made a mistake in the move count because each step is one unit, so from y=3 to y=7 requires four steps up, but with some right and left movements. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe after moving to (1,3), instead of going back up, proceed further right and then up.

But let's see:

After move 4: at (1,3)

Move 5: RIGHT → (2,3). But initial body didn't extend that far. Wait, no—the snake can move beyond the previous positions as long as it doesn't collide.

Wait, from (1,3), moving RIGHT to (2,3):

Check collision with current body [ (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0) ] → new_head (2,3) not present → safe.

So move 5: RIGHT → (2,3)

Now at (2,3). Next move can't be LEFT. So options: UP and DOWN.

Move 6: UP → (2,4)

Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) ]. New_head (2,4). Not present → safe.

Proceeding to (2,4):

Move 6: UP

Body becomes:

Insert old head (2,3) at front → [ (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) ], remove tail (0,0). New body [ (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) ].

Now at (2,4). Next move can't be DOWN. So options: LEFT and RIGHT.

Move 7: UP → (2,5)

Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) ]. New_head (2,5). Not present → safe.

Proceeding to (2,5):

Move 7: UP

Body becomes:

Insert old head (2,4) at front → [ (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) ], remove tail (0,1). New body [ (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2) ].

Now at (2,5). Next move can't be DOWN. So options: LEFT and RIGHT.

Move 8: UP → (2,6)

Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2) ]. New_head (2,6). Not present → safe.

Proceeding to (2,6):

Move 8: UP

Body becomes:

Insert old head (2,5) at front → [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2) ], remove tail (0,2). New body [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3) ].

Now at (2,6). Next move can't be DOWN. So options: LEFT and RIGHT.

Move 9: UP → (2,7)

Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3) ]. New_head (2,7). Not present → safe.

Proceeding to (2,7):

But we need to reach (1,7), so this isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps move LEFT back to (1,6).

From (2,6):

Move 9: LEFT → (1,6)

Check collision:

Body before shifting [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3) ]. New_head (1,6). Not present → safe.

Proceeding to (1,6):

Move 9: LEFT

Body becomes:

Insert old head (2,6) at front → [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3) ], remove tail (0,3). New body [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3) ].

Now at (1,6). Next move can't be RIGHT. So options: UP and DOWN.

Move 10: UP → (1,7)

So again, it took 10 moves either way.

But perhaps there's a smarter path with fewer steps by avoiding some backtracking.

Wait, but in the first approach, we went from (1,3) to (1,4), then left and up multiple times. Maybe that was longer than necessary.

Alternatively, after reaching (1,3), go up to (1,7) directly:

From (1,3):

Move 5: UP → (1,4)

Move 6: UP → (1,5)

Move 7: UP → (1,6)

Move 8: UP → (1,7)

That's four moves from (1,3), so total of 4 + previous 4 = 8 moves.

Wait, let me recount:

Moves:

1. UP → (0,1)

2. UP → (0,2)

3. UP → (0,3)

4. RIGHT → (1,3)

5. UP → (1,4)

6. UP → (1,5)

7. UP → (1,6)

8. UP → (1,7)

Yes, that's 8 moves. That seems more efficient.

So perhaps the minimal number of moves is 8.

I think I was complicating it before by moving further right and then backtracking, which added unnecessary steps.
</think>

The snake can reach the destination in a minimum of 8 moves by strategically moving up and right without unnecessary detours.

6. **Move Up**: From (1,4) to (1,5)
7. **Move Up**: From (1,5) to (1,6)
8. **Move Up**: From (1,6) to (1,7)

**Answer:** The snake reaches the destination in \boxed{8} moves.
