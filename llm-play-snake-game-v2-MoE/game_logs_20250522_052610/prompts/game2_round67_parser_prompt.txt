<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the snake from (5,2) to eat the apple at (6,1). Let me start by understanding all the given information and constraints.

First, the snake's head is at (5,2), and it's currently moving DOWN. The body cells are [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]. So the snake is a long line that starts at the head and goes through these points. Wait, but since the direction is DOWN, I should check how the body segments follow.

The apple is at (6,1). The Manhattan distance from the head to the apple is |6-5| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. So ideally, it shouldn't take more than two moves, but considering the snake's movement and collision constraints, maybe more are needed.

Movement rules: The snake can't reverse direction immediately. So if it's currently going DOWN, the first move can't be UP because that would reverse the direction. Wait no—rule 3 says you can't reverse; so from DOWN, next move can't be UP. But in this case, the current direction is DOWN, but when planning moves, since the head is moving, the direction after the first move must not be opposite to the previous direction.

Wait, wait—the problem states that the current direction is DOWN, but I think for movement purposes, the initial state's direction is DOWN. So the next move can't be UP because it's reversing. Wait no: rule 3 says you can't reverse direction on any step except when direction is NONE. So if the snake's current direction is DOWN, the next move cannot be UP.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial direction is given as DOWN, so after moving, each subsequent move can't be opposite to the previous one.

Wait no: Rule 3 says that the snake cannot reverse direction. So if it's moving DOWN and then tries to move UP, that's reversing, which isn't allowed. Similarly for other directions.

But when the direction is NONE (which isn't the case here), any move is allowed.

So in this scenario, since current direction is DOWN, first move can't be UP.

Wait no: The initial direction is DOWN, so first move must not be UP because that would reverse. But wait, if the current direction is DOWN and the next move is RIGHT or LEFT or something else, but in our case, we're at (5,2) and apple is at (6,1), which requires moving right then down or maybe a different path.

Wait, let's look at the coordinates. The head is at (5,2). Apple is at (6,1). So from (5,2), to reach (6,1), I need to move right once and down once. But wait, because y decreases as we go down? Because in the coordinate system, UP increases y by 1, DOWN decreases y by 1.

So from (5,2), moving RIGHT takes x to 6, so (6,2). Then moving DOWN takes y from 2 to 1, so (6,1).

But wait, can I do that? Let's see the path. From head at (5,2), move RIGHT to (6,2). But then, after moving, the body would shift. So after the first move, the new head is at (6,2), and the previous body segments are now in front of it.

Wait, but what about the body? The current body cells are [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]. So when the head moves to (6,2), the tail would normally move unless it's eating an apple. Since in this case, we're not yet eating the apple on the first move.

Wait no—the first move is just moving towards the apple; we eat the apple only once we reach it. So after each move, if the apple isn't eaten, the tail moves as usual.

But let me think step by step.

Current state:

Head: (5,2), direction: DOWN.

Body cells: list from (5,8) down to (5,3). Wait, but how are they ordered? The body is given as a list of positions, excluding the head. So the order would be from the head towards the tail. So the first element is the segment right after the head. So if the snake's direction is DOWN, each subsequent body cell should be in line.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me instead consider the possible moves.

From (5,2), current direction is DOWN, so moving DOWN next would take the head to (5,1). But that's the position of the apple! So wait, apple is at (6,1), not (5,1). Hmm, no—the apple is at (6,1), which is one cell right and one down from (5,2).

So, if I move RIGHT first, then DOWN.

But let me see: moving RIGHT to (6,2) is allowed? Because current direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP. But moving RIGHT is allowed since it's not reversing direction.

Wait no—rule 3 says the snake cannot reverse direction on any step except when direction is NONE. So if the current direction is DOWN, then next direction can't be UP, but other directions are allowed.

So first move could be RIGHT to (6,2). Then, after that, the next move would be DOWN to (6,1), which is where the apple is.

But wait, when moving RIGHT from (5,2) to (6,2), we have to make sure that this new head position doesn't collide with any part of the body. The current body cells are [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]. So when we move to (6,2), is that position occupied by any body cell? Looking at the list: no, because the body cells are at higher y values. The highest y in body is 8, and as we go down, they decrease. But none of them are at (6,2). So that's safe.

After moving to (6,2), the direction would be RIGHT. Now, next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction from RIGHT to LEFT. Wait no: reversing from RIGHT to LEFT is allowed? Or does it count as a reversal?

Wait, according to rule 3, you cannot reverse direction on any step except when direction is NONE. So if the current direction is RIGHT, you can't move LEFT next, because that would be reversing.

But in our case, after moving RIGHT, we'd need to move DOWN. So from (6,2), moving DOWN to (6,1). Is that allowed? Yes, because the previous direction was RIGHT; moving DOWN isn't a reversal.

Wait, but wait: when you change direction, it's only considered a reversal if it's the opposite of the current direction. For example, if you're going DOWN and then go UP, that's reversing. But from RIGHT to DOWN is allowed.

So in this scenario:

Move 1: RIGHT → (6,2)

Then move 2: DOWN → (6,1), which is where the apple is.

But wait, let me check what happens after each move in terms of body segments and collision.

First move: head moves from (5,2) to (6,2). The previous direction was DOWN; new direction is RIGHT. So the movement is allowed because it's not reversing.

Now, the new position (6,2) must be checked against the body. Current body cells are [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]. So (6,2) isn't in any of these, so no collision.

After this move, the body will shift: each segment moves forward. The head was at (5,2). After moving to (6,2), the new body starts with (5,2), then all previous body cells are shifted. Wait, but the body list is [(5,8), ...], which I think represents the segments after the head.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the snake as a list starting from the head and followed by each segment in order.

So current state:

Head: (5,2)

Body: [ (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) ]

Wait, that's 8 body segments. So the full snake is head + these body cells.

When the head moves to (6,2), the new body will be:

The previous head (5,2) becomes part of the body, and each subsequent segment follows.

But in this case, after moving RIGHT, the new body would be:

(5,2), (5,8), (5,7), etc., but that seems off. Wait no—when the snake moves, the body segments follow in order. So when the head moves to a new position, each segment moves into the previous one's place.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the snake as a list where each element is the next part of the body, starting from the head and going towards the tail. So the first element after the head is the next segment in front of the head, then so on until the tail.

So when moving, the new head is added to the beginning, and all other segments shift forward, with the last one (tail) being removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, but in this problem, we're only eating the apple once at the end. So each move that doesn't eat an apple causes the tail to be cut.

So after moving to (6,2), which doesn't eat the apple yet, the body segments would shift:

New head: (6,2)

Body cells become [ (5,2) ] + previous body cells without the last one? Or wait, no—each segment moves into the position of the previous one.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when moving, each part of the snake follows the part in front. So the new head is added at the front, and all other parts move forward accordingly, with the tail being removed unless an apple was eaten.

In this case, since we're not eating the apple yet, after moving RIGHT, the body would be:

New head: (6,2)

Then the previous head position (5,2) becomes part of the body.

The next segments are the original body cells except the tail, which is removed. So the new body list would be [ (5,2), (5,8), (5,7), ..., (5,3) ] minus the last one? Wait no—since we have 8 body cells, after moving, the snake grows only if an apple is eaten.

Wait, in this first move, since we're not eating the apple, the tail will be removed. So the new body would consist of all previous segments except the last one, which is (5,3). Wait no—the initial body has 8 cells. After moving without eating the apple, the snake's length remains the same. So when moving, each segment moves into the next position.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to model it step by step.

Initial state:

Head: (5,2), direction: DOWN

Body: [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]

So the full snake is head at (5,2) followed by these body cells. So from (5,2), moving DOWN would take it to (5,1). But that's not where we want to go; we need to move RIGHT then DOWN.

Wait, but the initial direction is DOWN, so can I change direction on the first move? Because rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. Since the current direction is DOWN, next move cannot be UP. So moving RIGHT or LEFT is allowed as long as it's not a reversal.

So from DOWN, moving to RIGHT is allowed because it's not reversing.

So first move: RIGHT to (6,2).

Now, after this move:

New head position: (6,2)

Previous direction was DOWN; new direction is RIGHT. So next moves can't be LEFT.

The body segments shift:

Each segment follows the one in front. The previous head (5,2) becomes part of the body. Then each subsequent segment moves into the next position.

So the new body cells would be:

(5,2), followed by all the original body cells except the last one? Or wait, no—the initial body is 8 segments after the head. So when moving, the new head is added to the front, and each segment shifts forward, with the tail being dropped if not eating.

So after moving to (6,2) without eating the apple:

New head: (6,2)

Body cells: [(5,2), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]

Because we removed the last segment (5,3) as it's no longer part of the body.

Wait, but that would make the snake length 9 now? Because head + 8 body cells.

But initially, the snake had a head plus 8 body cells. After moving, without eating, it should still have 8 body cells. So perhaps after moving, the new body is all previous body cells except the last one.

Wait no—when you move, each segment moves into the next position. The tail is removed unless an apple is eaten. So in this case, since we didn't eat, the tail (5,3) is dropped.

So new body list is:

(5,2), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)

Now, for the second move: from (6,2), direction is RIGHT. Next move can be any except LEFT.

We need to go DOWN to (6,1) where the apple is.

So move 2: DOWN to (6,1).

Check if this position is safe.

The current body after first move includes (5,8), etc., and none are at (6,1). So no collision.

After moving to (6,1):

New head position: (6,1)

Previous direction was RIGHT; new direction is DOWN. So next move can't be UP.

Since we've reached the apple's position, this would trigger eating it.

So when you eat the apple, the snake grows by one segment without losing the tail.

Wait no—when you eat an apple, you add a new segment to the end (tail) instead of removing it. So after moving and eating, the body increases in length.

But in our case, we've already reached the apple's position with this move, so we need to check if the move is valid, then process the apple.

So after move 2:

New head: (6,1)

Body cells: [(5,2), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), ...? Wait no—after moving to (6,1) and eating the apple, we add a new segment at the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that after two moves, we reach the apple's position without colliding with our own body, so it's valid.

But wait a second—after moving to (6,2), when we move DOWN to (6,1), does any part of the body occupy (6,1)? Let's check.

The body after first move is:

(5,2) → this is the first segment after the head at (6,2)

Then: (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)

So none of these are at (6,1). So it's safe.

Therefore, the moves would be:

1. RIGHT → (6,2)

2. DOWN → (6,1) [apple]

But wait, let me double-check if that's allowed in terms of direction changes.

First move: from DOWN to RIGHT—allowed because it's not reversing.

Second move: from RIGHT to DOWN—allowed because it's not reversing.

So yes, this sequence is valid.

Wait another thing: the apple is at (6,1), which is directly below (6,2). So after moving to (6,2), we can move down into (6,1).

Yes, that makes sense.

But wait—what if there's a snake segment in (6,1) after first move? Let me check again. After the first move, body segments are (5,2), then all previous body except (5,3). So none of them are at (6,1).

Therefore, this path is safe.

Thus, the minimal moves would be two steps: RIGHT and DOWN.

But wait—is that correct? Because from (5,2) moving RIGHT to (6,2), then DOWN to (6,1) where the apple is. So yes, it's a valid path.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple located at a specific target cell on a grid without colliding with any part of its own body. The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), and each move must not reverse the direction immediately after moving in the opposite direction.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake starts at position (5, 2) and needs to reach the apple at (6, 1). The snake's body is a list of segments that follow the head, and we must ensure that each move does not cause the head to collide with any part of its own body.

2. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction immediately. For example, if it moves down, it cannot move up next, but it can move left or right.

3. **Pathfinding Strategy**: We will use a step-by-step approach where each move is checked for safety (i.e., no collision with the body). The goal is to find the shortest path from the starting position to the target cell.

4. **Direction Changes**: Ensure that each direction change does not reverse the previous movement.

### Solution Code
```python
# Define the initial state of the snake and target apple position
start = (5, 2)
target = (6, 1)

# Initial body segments after the head; represents the rest of the snake's body
body = [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]

# List to store the path taken by the head
path = [start]

# Current direction of the snake; initially set to 'down' since the first move is down?
current_direction = None

# Move 1: Move right from start
new_head = (start[0] + 1, start[1])
if new_head not in body and new_head != target:
    path.append(new_head)
    current_direction = 'right'

# After moving right, the snake's body updates; we need to ensure no collision on next move
updated_body = [start] + body[:-1] if new_head != target else [start] + body

# Move 2: Move down from new_head (6,2) to reach target (6,1)
next_direction = 'down'
new_head_final = (new_head[0], new_head[1] - 1)

if new_head_final == target and new_head_final not in updated_body:
    path.append(new_head_final)
else:
    # This would indicate a problem with the initial assumption
    pass

print("Path taken:", path)
```

### Explanation
The solution involves moving the snake's head from its starting position (5, 2) to the target position (6, 1). The steps are as follows:

1. **Initial State**: The snake's head is at (5, 2), and its body segments are given.
2. **First Move**: The snake moves right to (6, 2). This move is valid because it does not reverse the initial direction (which was down).
3. **Second Move**: From (6, 2), the snake moves down to (6, 1) where the apple is located. This move is checked for safety and validity.

The final path taken by the snake's head is [(5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1)], successfully reaching the target without colliding with its body.
