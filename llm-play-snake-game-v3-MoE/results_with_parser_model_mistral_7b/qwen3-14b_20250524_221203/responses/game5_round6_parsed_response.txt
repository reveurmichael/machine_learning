{"moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"], "reasoning": "The reasoning for this path is based on the Manhattan distance between the initial position of the snake (9, 4) and the apple's position (4, 2). By moving towards the apple in a step-by-step manner and avoiding collisions with the snake's body cells, we can find a path that minimizes the number of moves. The chosen path is valid as it results in the snake reaching the apple while following all rules."}
