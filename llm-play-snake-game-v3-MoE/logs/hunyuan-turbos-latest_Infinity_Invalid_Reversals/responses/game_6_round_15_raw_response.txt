========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The apple is located at (3,3), which requires moving left 4 times and up 2 times from the head's current position (7,1). The first two moves are 'LEFT' to avoid reversing direction and to start moving towards the apple. The next two moves are 'UP' to align vertically with the apple. This path avoids collisions with the snake's body and ensures the snake can reach the apple safely."
