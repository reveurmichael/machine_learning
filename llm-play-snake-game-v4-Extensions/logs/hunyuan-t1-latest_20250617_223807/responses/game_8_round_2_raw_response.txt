========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 7 units left (from x=7 to 0) and 3 units down (from y=4 to 1). Starting with LEFT moves avoids reversing the initial DOWN direction and safely navigates left while keeping the body trailing behind. After reaching x=0, moving DOWN adjusts the y-coordinate to reach the apple at (0,1). Each move is checked for collisions with the body (which trails safely behind) and stays within grid bounds. After eating the apple, the snake has space to move next (e.g., DOWN to (0,0) or RIGHT to (1,1)), avoiding immediate trapping."
