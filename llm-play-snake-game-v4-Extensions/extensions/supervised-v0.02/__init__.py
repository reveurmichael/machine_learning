"""
Supervised Learning v0.02 - Multi-Model Framework
--------------------

This extension demonstrates the evolution from neural networks only (v0.01)
to a multi-model, multi-framework supervised learning system. It supports
PyTorch neural networks, tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest),
and graph neural networks (PyTorch Geometric).

Features:
- Multiple model types and frameworks
- Modular training and evaluation scripts
- Dataset integration from heuristics extensions
- Model persistence and benchmarking
- Reuse of Task-0 base classes and common utilities

This extension is a bridge to more advanced ML workflows, enabling
comprehensive benchmarking and comparison of different supervised approaches.
