========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left twice to reach x=2 (from x=4) and down seven times to reach y=2 (from y=9). The initial body is aligned right of the head, so moving left first avoids collision. Subsequent down moves follow the apple's position, with each step checking for safe body positions. After reaching the apple, the snake can continue moving down safely, ensuring no immediate trapping."
