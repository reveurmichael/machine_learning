BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (5,8). So the apple is directly above the head. The current direction is NONE, so the first move can be any direction. But the snake can't reverse direction, but since the initial direction is NONE, that's not an issue here.

First, I need to move the head from (5,5) to (5,8). Since the x-coordinate is the same, the snake needs to move up three times. But wait, the movement rules say that the snake can't reverse direction. But since the initial direction is NONE, the first move can be UP. Let me check the movement steps.

Each move adds the direction vector to the head's position. So moving UP would take the head from (5,5) to (5,6), then again to (5,7), and then to (5,8). That's three UP moves. But I need to make sure that during this movement, the snake doesn't collide with its body. However, the body cells are empty in this case. So the body is empty, meaning the snake is just the head. So moving straight up three times should be safe.

Wait, the body is given as an empty list. So the snake is only the head. Therefore, moving up three times would take the head to the apple. But after eating the apple, the snake's body would grow by one segment. But since the body was empty, after eating the apple, the body would have one segment. However, the problem says that the tail doesn't shrink on the next move if the apple is eaten. So after reaching the apple, the snake would have a body segment at the previous head position.

But the main concern here is the path to the apple. Since there's no body, moving directly up three times is safe. Let me check the coordinates. Starting at (5,5), moving UP once: (5,6). Then again (5,7), then (5,8). That's three moves. The apple is at (5,8), so that's correct.

But wait, the movement rules also state that after eating the apple, the snake must have at least one legal move. After eating the apple, the snake's body would have one segment. Let's think about that. When the head is at (5,8) and the apple is eaten, the body would be the previous positions. Wait, the movement update says that the new head is head + direction, then the head becomes a body segment, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. So when the apple is eaten, the tail remains. But since the snake was just the head before eating the apple, after eating, the body would be the previous head position (5,5), (5,6), (5,7) as the body? Or maybe not. Wait, the snake grows by one segment. So when the apple is eaten, the tail doesn't get removed. So the body length increases by one. So the initial body is empty. After moving to (5,8) and eating the apple, the body would have one segment. Let me think step by step.

Let's simulate each move:

Initial state: head at (5,5), body is empty, apple at (5,8).

Move 1: UP → new head (5,6). Since the apple is not eaten, the body is updated. The head becomes a body segment, and the tail is removed. But since the body was empty, the new body is [(5,5)]. So after first move, body is [(5,5)].

Move 2: UP → new head (5,7). The body becomes [(5,6), (5,5)]. The tail (5,5) is removed? Wait, no. Wait, the movement rule says: "Head becomes body segment. Tail is removed unless apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains)."

So when the apple is not eaten, the tail is removed. So after each move, the body is updated by adding the previous head position and removing the tail.

But in the first move, the head is at (5,5). After moving to (5,6), the new head is (5,6), and the body is [(5,5)], because the tail is removed (since no apple eaten). Wait, but the body was empty before. So adding the previous head (5,5) as the new body segment, and since the tail is removed (which is nothing here), the body is [(5,5)].

Then, moving again to (5,7): the new head is (5,7), the body becomes [(5,6), (5,5)], because the previous head (5,6) is added to the body, and the tail (5,5) is removed? No, wait. Wait, the movement rule says that the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. So when moving, the head becomes the new body segment, and the tail is removed. So for each move, the body is updated by adding the previous head position (now the new body segment) and removing the last element of the body (the tail) unless the apple was eaten.

So in the first move, since the apple is not eaten, the body is [ (5,5) ].

Second move: head is (5,6) → moving to (5,7). The body becomes [ (5,6), (5,5) ]? Wait, no. The body is updated as follows: the head becomes part of the body. So the new body is the previous body (which was [ (5,5) ]) with the new head's previous position (5,6) added to the front. Then, the tail is removed. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me check the movement update again: "New head = head + direction. Head becomes body segment. Tail is removed unless apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains)."

So, when moving, the new head is calculated. Then, the previous head becomes a body segment. The tail is removed (so the body length remains the same) unless the apple was eaten, in which case the tail remains (so body length increases by one).

In the initial state, the body is empty. So after moving to (5,6), the head becomes part of the body. Since the apple is not eaten, the tail is removed. But since the body was empty, adding the previous head (5,5) as a body segment and then removing the tail (which is none). So body is [ (5,5) ].

Then, moving to (5,7): previous head is (5,6), which becomes a body segment. The body is [ (5,6), (5,5) ] but since the tail is removed (apple not eaten), the body is [ (5,6) ]? Wait, no. The body is updated by adding the previous head to the body, and then removing the tail. So the body length is same as before. So initial body length is 0. After first move, body length is 1. Then, when moving again, the body length remains 1. So after moving to (5,7), the body is [ (5,6) ].

Wait, this seems conflicting. Maybe the correct way is that the body is a list of positions. Each move, the new head is added to the front of the body, and the last element is removed unless apple is eaten.

So, initial body is empty. After moving to (5,6), the body becomes [ (5,5) ] (since previous head is added, and no tail to remove because the body was empty).

Then, moving to (5,7), the body becomes [ (5,6), (5,5) ] and then the tail (5,5) is removed, making it [ (5,6) ].

Wait, but if the body is [ (5,5) ] and you add (5,6) to the front, the body becomes [ (5,6), (5,5) ] and then the tail (5,5) is removed, resulting in [ (5,6) ].

So after the second move, the body is [ (5,6) ].

Third move: moving to (5,8). Now, the head is at (5,8), which is the apple's position. So when this move is made, the apple is eaten. Therefore, the tail is not removed. So the body becomes [ (5,7), (5,6) ] (since the previous head (5,7) is added to the front, and the tail is not removed). So the body is [ (5,7), (5,6) ].

Now, after eating the apple, the snake's body is two segments. So the head is at (5,8), and the body is [ (5,7), (5,6) ].

Now, the next move must be a direction that doesn't cause collision. The snake can move in any direction except the reverse of the current direction. Wait, the current direction is UP. So the next move cannot be DOWN. But after eating the apple, the snake has to have at least one legal move. So after reaching the apple, the snake's head is at (5,8), and the body is [ (5,7), (5,6) ].

So possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT, but not DOWN. Let's see:

If the snake moves UP again, the new head would be (5,9), which is within the grid. Then the body would be [ (5,8), (5,7) ], and the tail (5,6) is removed? Wait, no. Because the apple was eaten, the tail is not removed. Wait, in this case, when the apple was eaten, the tail is not removed. So when moving after eating the apple, the tail is not removed. Wait, the movement rule says that the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. So when the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed. Therefore, when the apple is eaten, the body grows by one. So after eating the apple, when the snake moves again, the tail is not removed. Therefore, the body length increases by one. So in the third move, after eating the apple, the body is [ (5,7), (5,6) ] and the head is (5,8). Then, moving again, the new head is (5,8) + direction. Let's say moving UP: new head is (5,9). The body becomes [ (5,8), (5,7), (5,6) ] because the previous head (5,8) is added to the body, and since the apple was eaten, the tail is not removed. So the body length increases by one.

But the problem says that after eating the apple, the snake must have at least one legal move. So when the snake is at (5,8), the body is [ (5,7), (5,6) ]. The next move can't be DOWN (reverse of UP). So the possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. All of which are safe as long as they don't hit the body.

For example, moving UP to (5,9) is safe. Moving LEFT to (4,8) is safe. Moving RIGHT to (6,8) is safe. So there are options. Therefore, the path is safe.

So the moves would be ["UP", "UP", "UP"], which takes the head from (5,5) to (5,8). That's three moves. Let me check if that's correct.

Yes. The initial position is (5,5). After three UP moves, it's at (5,8). Each move is valid, no collision with body (since body is empty initially), and after eating the apple, the next moves are possible.

So the answer should be three UP moves. The reasoning is that since the apple is directly above, and the body is empty, moving straight up is the shortest and safest path. No need for detours. Also, after eating the apple, the snake can move in any direction except down, which is safe.

{
  "moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The apple is directly above the head at (5,8). With no body segments to collide with, moving straight up three times is the shortest and safest path. After eating the apple, the snake will have one body segment, allowing at least one legal move (e.g., UP, LEFT, or RIGHT)."

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (5, 8).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
