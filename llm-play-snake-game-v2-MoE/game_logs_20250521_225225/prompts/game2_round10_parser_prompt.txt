Alright, so I've got this classic Snake game problem to solve. The snake is at position (6,3), facing DOWN. It needs to reach the apple at (9,3). Let me break down what I know and figure out a plan.

First off, the grid is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. The snake can't reverse its direction unless it's NONE. So if it's moving DOWN now, next move can only be UP or NONE. Also, each move involves the head moving in a new direction, and the body follows accordingly.

The apple is directly ahead on the x-axis since both are at y=3. The snake needs to cover 3 units right (from x=6 to x=9). So, logically, it should make three RIGHT moves if possible without any obstacles.

But wait, there's a body of the snake in empty list here—so no existing segments except the head. That simplifies things because initially, the snake is just the head at (6,3). So moving right each time won't cause an immediate collision since there's nothing blocking.

However, after each move, the snake grows if it eats the apple. Right now, before eating, the body is empty, so moving right should be safe until it reaches the apple.

Let me outline a possible sequence:

1. Move RIGHT: Head goes to (7,3). Since the body is empty, no collision.
2. Next move must also be RIGHT because the current direction is RIGHT and we're not allowed to reverse on first move? Wait, rule 4 says that if direction is "NONE", any move is allowed. But since after each move, direction remains the same unless changed.

Wait, initial direction is DOWN. So after moving RIGHT, the snake's head moves right, but its body would have shifted left except for when it eats the apple. Since there's no body yet, maybe all moves are possible as long as they don't go out of bounds or hit walls immediately.

But actually, when moving, the new position becomes the head, and the previous head (now body) is removed unless eating apple. So with no body initially:

First move: RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3). Then body cells would be [(6,3)]. Next direction remains DOWN? Or can it change?

Wait, the initial direction is DOWN. The snake hasn't eaten anything yet. So each move after that will shift all body parts accordingly.

But perhaps the direction stays the same until a decision is made to change or until the apple is eaten. Since we need to reach (9,3), which is 3 units right from current position, moving RIGHT thrice makes sense, provided it doesn't hit any walls or self.

Wait, but the initial head is at (6,3). Moving RIGHT once: x increases by 1, so becomes (7,3). Then again to (8,3), then to (9,3). That's three RIGHT moves. But wait, direction was initially DOWN; after moving right once, can we change direction?

Wait no, the initial direction is DOWN. So first move must be in a different direction if trying to turn.

But actually, rule 4 says that if current direction is not NONE, next move cannot reverse it. Since the snake is currently facing DOWN, next moves can't be UP unless the current position allows turning without reversing.

Wait no, the initial direction is DOWN, so after moving in another direction (like RIGHT), you can change to a new direction as long as you don't reverse immediately.

Hmm, this seems confusing. Let me clarify:

Rule 4: Direction cannot reverse on next move if it's not NONE. So from direction D, next allowed directions are U, R, or same as current unless current is NONE (then any).

So initial direction is DOWN.

First move can be RIGHT, LEFT, UP, or NONE? Wait no—if the snake moves in a different direction than DOWN, except for the case when it's moving NONE. So first move after facing DOWN cannot be DOWN again because that would require same direction, but wait—wait, rule 4 says "cannot reverse"—if reversing is going from one direction to another.

Wait, I think the correct interpretation is: if the snake was moving UP, then next can't be DOWN unless in some way it's allowed. But in this case, since initial direction is DOWN, first move cannot be any other except maybe NONE? Or can change as long as not reversing immediately?

I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model each step, ensuring that the snake doesn't reverse until a certain point unless forced by collision or other constraints.

But to make progress towards (9,3), which is 3 units right from x=6. So if we can move RIGHT three times in a row without any issues, that would be ideal.

However, since initial direction is DOWN, moving RIGHT after facing DOWN is allowed because it's not reversing—unless the rules prohibit changing directions immediately. Wait, rule 2 says valid directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, and NONE. So as long as you don't reverse direction from your current one unless you're going to another.

Wait, perhaps 'reverse' in this context refers to turning around, but actually, moving in a different perpendicular direction is allowed.

Alternatively, the rule says that after each move, if it was not NONE before, next cannot be opposite (like if moving DOWN now, next can't be UP unless you're changing from another path).

This part is unclear. But perhaps for initial steps, we don't need to worry about changing directions because there are no other body parts blocking.

So let's try:

1st move: RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3). Body becomes [(6,3)]. Direction remains DOWN.
2nd move: RIGHT again from (7,3) to (8,3). Body now is [(7,3), (6,3)]. Still no collision. Direction remains DOWN.
Wait, but if it's moving in the same direction each time without turning, can that be? Wait, the problem says that after moving, the body follows.

But when you move RIGHT once, only the head moves right; the previous head is now part of the body at its old position (6,3). So with no collision yet because it's just a straight line?

Hmm. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think in terms of how each move affects the snake.

Each time you make a move, the head moves to the new cell, and all other body segments shift accordingly—except when eating the apple. Since there is no initial body except the head (which will become part of the body after first move), perhaps the snake can extend straight in one direction as it moves without collision.

So moving RIGHT three times would get the head from 6 to 9, and each move's cell becomes a new body segment behind the previous head. So:

1. Move RIGHT: (7,3). Body now is [(6,3)].
2. Next move can be RIGHT again because after first RIGHT, direction was DOWN but changed? Wait no.

Wait initial direction is DOWN, so moving in another direction isn't a reversal of DOWN—so it's allowed unless rule 4 prohibits changing directions immediately?

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to model each step:

Initial state: head at (6,3), body empty.

Move RIGHT:
- Head moves from (6,3) to (7,3).
- Body is now [(6,3)].
- Direction remains DOWN? Or does changing direction affect the next move?

Since initial direction was DOWN, moving in another direction may be allowed as long as not directly reversing. So if you're facing DOWN and then turn LEFT or RIGHT, that's a change of 90 degrees, which isn't considered 'reversing' per rule.

So perhaps after first RIGHT:

- Direction is now RIGHT.
- Next move must be different: cannot go back to DOWN unless allowed?

Wait no—rule says direction cannot reverse on next move. So if you were moving in a certain direction and then change to another, that's not reversing; only when you're directly changing from one opposite direction.

Alternatively, perhaps after each move except NONE, the next direction can be any as long as it is not opposite? Or maybe rule 4 allows all directions except for the immediate reverse.

Wait if initial direction is DOWN and first move was RIGHT (90 degrees), that's allowed. Then second move from RIGHT to DOWN would be a left turn but isn't considered reversing—so also allowed.

But this seems complicated without precise rule interpretation.

Given time constraints, perhaps proceed with moving RIGHT thrice:

1. Move RIGHT: head at (7,3). Direction becomes RIGHT.
2. Next can't move DOWN because that's changing direction from RIGHT to DOWN? Or is it allowed?

Wait Rule 4 says current cannot reverse on next move if not NONE. So in this case, initial direction was DOWN; first move is RIGHT.

So after moving RIGHT (changing to RIGHT), the snake now has a body at (6,3). Next move—can we go DOWN again? Because the previous direction was RIGHT; new direction can be anything except reverse of RIGHT?

Wait no, since direction changed from DOWN to RIGHT. So if you were going RIGHT and then turn DOWN would that be a 'reverse' as in backtracking.

This is really confusing without clear rule on what counts as reversing. If I proceed with moving RIGHT three times:

First move: RIGHT (6→7), body at 6.
Second move: RIGHT again, head to 8, body now includes previous head at 7 and new at 8's tail at 7? Wait no—each time you move, the entire body shifts.

Wait correction: Each time you make a step, the head moves to a new cell. All other segments shift left (or wherever). So after first RIGHT:

- Head is now at (7,3).
- Previous head (6,3) becomes the tail of the next segment.
- Direction was DOWN before but changed? Or does moving in another direction affect the subsequent movement.

This seems too complex without exact rule. Maybe just assume that when you move in a straight line, each step is allowed except for cases where it would cause collision with body segments ahead.

But in this case, moving RIGHT thrice won't collide because:

1st: (6→7)
Body becomes [(6)]
2nd: (7→8), body becomes [(7),(6)]
3rd: (8→9), body becomes [(8),(7),(6)]

No collision occurs as each move only adds to the tail.

Therefore, moving RIGHT thrice is allowed.

But wait—the initial direction was DOWN. How can you turn right and then continue without changing direction?

Wait perhaps after the first move in a different direction than initial, subsequent moves can be in any other direction except direct reverse—so maybe it's acceptable.

Alternatively, another approach: since there are no enemies or obstacles mentioned, the snake just needs to navigate from (6,3) eastward. So simply moving RIGHT thrice gets you to (9,3). That seems straightforward without worrying about changing directions and potential collisions with your own body, as each movement only adds a new tail segment.

So after three moves:

- Each move is RIGHT.
- Body grows by one cell at the end of the snake.
- No collision occurs because it's moving in a straight line.

Thus, solution would be to make three rightward moves: RIGHT x3. So in terms of directions: DOWN is initial direction but turning east after first step, so perhaps changing direction mid-way.

Wait no—the initial direction was down—but if you move east once, then the next steps could continue moving East without issue.

Alternatively, maybe starting with a LEFT or UP would complicate things? No—best to just go straight.

Thus, the minimal path is three moves: RIGHT x3.

But wait, after moving RIGHT for first time:

- Head at (7,3). Body includes previous head at (6,3).
Second move must be direction that doesn't cause collision with existing body. So moving down again from 7 would go to 7→4? That's invalid because it's not in same row.

Wait no—coordinates are (row,column), but I'm getting confused about axes.

Assuming coordinates as (x,y) where x is columns, y rows, or vice versa.

But original position: head at (6,3). So 6 on first axis and 3 second. Let's say it's row-major; so row=6, column=3? Or perhaps not—coordinates can be ambiguous without knowing system.

Wait problem says from position (6,3) to where? No destination given—it just said "east".

So perhaps the snake moves in such a way that each move is only possible if there’s space ahead. So moving east once: head at 7. Then again to 8. Then to 9—no issue.

But how does initial direction affect subsequent moves?

Wait I think without knowing exact rules about changing directions and whether it affects next movement, but since the body isn't blocking forward in straight line path, perhaps three RIGHT moves are allowed regardless of previous direction.

Thus, conclusion is that minimal number of moves is 3: all eastward.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at (6,3) to move it eastwards. The goal is to determine the sequence of moves required for the snake to reach its destination without colliding with its own body.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Movement**: The snake can move in four directions: north, south, east, or west. Each move will cause the head of the snake to move in that direction while all other segments follow behind.
2. **Direction Changes**: Since there are no enemies or obstacles mentioned, we don't need to worry about avoiding them. However, we must ensure that each move does not result in a collision with the snake's own body.
3. **Straight Line Movement**: Moving eastward from (6,3) is straightforward as it allows continuous growth of the snake without any potential collisions, assuming there are no obstacles.

Given these considerations, moving east three times consecutively will suffice to take the snake from position (6,3) to (9,3).

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial direction is DOWN. We need to move the snake east.
moves = ['RIGHT', 'RIGHT', 'RIGHT']
print(' '.join(moves))
```

### Explanation
The solution involves moving the snake three times in the eastward direction:
1. **First Move (RIGHT)**: The snake moves from (6,3) to (7,3). The body of the snake now includes positions [(6,3)].
2. **Second Move (RIGHT)**: The snake moves from (7,3) to (8,3). The body now includes positions [(7,3), (6,3)].
3. **Third Move (RIGHT)**: The snake moves from (8,3) to (9,3). The body now includes positions [(8,3), (7,3), (6,3)].

Each move is valid as it does not result in a collision with the snake's own body since the movement is in a straight line. Thus, three consecutive moves to the east will successfully navigate the snake from its starting position to the destination.
