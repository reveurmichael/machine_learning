Let me analyze the current game state and plan a safe path to the apple at (0,5):

Current situation:
- Snake head at (8,2) facing DOWN (Hâ†“)
- Snake body segment at (7,2)
- Apple at (0,5)
- Board is 10x10 with walls on edges

Constraints:
1. Can't move UP (opposite of current DOWN direction)
2. Must avoid walls and body segments
3. Need to navigate toward top of board where apple is

Safe path considerations:
- First need to change direction from DOWN to either LEFT or RIGHT
- Then need to move upward while avoiding walls
- The apple is 8 rows up and 3 columns to the right

Optimal path plan:
1. First turn RIGHT to start moving horizontally
2. Then move UP several times to reach apple's row
3. Finally move RIGHT to reach apple

Here's the move sequence (15 moves total to reach apple):

1. RIGHT (from current DOWN direction, can't go UP)
2. UP (now facing RIGHT, can go UP)
3. UP
4. UP 
5. UP
6. UP
7. UP
8. UP
9. UP
10. UP (now at row 0, same as apple)
11. RIGHT
12. RIGHT
13. RIGHT (reaches apple at (0,5))

This path:
- Avoids immediate collision by first turning RIGHT
- Takes the most direct vertical path upward
- Then moves horizontally to the apple
- Doesn't hit any walls or body segments
- Completes in 13 moves to reach the apple

Alternative safe paths would involve more horizontal movement first before going up, but this is the most direct route that obeys all movement rules.
