========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I need to plan a path for the snake starting at (5,5) to reach the apple at (8,5). The current direction is NONE, so the first move can be any direction except reversing. 

The head is at (5,5), and the apple is three cells to the right. So the straightforward path would be moving RIGHT three times: from (5,5) → (6,5) → (7,5) → (8,5). 

I should check if this path is safe. The body is currently empty, so no collision issues with the body segments. Each move to the right increases x by 1, which seems simple.

Also, after eating the apple at (8,5), the snake's body will grow. I need to ensure that there's at least one legal move next turn. But since the apple is at the end of the grid (x=8), moving further right isn't possible, but the other directions are still available unless blocked by the body.

Since the initial moves don't involve any reversing and the path is clear, it seems safe to proceed with RIGHT three times.
