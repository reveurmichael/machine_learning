{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 5 times (from x=6 to x=1) and up once (from y=3 to y=4) to reach the apple at (1,4). Moving LEFT first avoids collision with the body (initially at y=4, which is above the head). Each LEFT move shifts the body safely, and after reaching (1,3), moving UP to (1,4) eats the apple without colliding with the body. Post-move, there are legal directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) to ensure survival."
