Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm supposed to help an AI agent control a snake in the classic Snake game. The goal is to plan a safe path for the snake's head to reach and eat the apple without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds.

First, let me understand the given inputs:

- **Head position**: (7, 6). That's near the top-right part of the grid.
- **Current direction**: RIGHT. So the snake was moving right before this move.
- **Body cells**: A list of coordinates that make up the body. Looking at them, they seem to form a line starting from (0,4) and extending all the way to (6,6), which is just below the head.
- **Apple position**: (4, 4). That's somewhere in the middle-left area.

The movement rules say that the snake can't reverse direction. Since it's currently moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. Also, from "NONE" direction, any move is allowed. But here, since the current direction is RIGHT, the first move can't be LEFT because that would be reversing.

Constraints to keep in mind:
- After each move, the head becomes a body segment, and the tail shrinks unless an apple is eaten.
- The snake dies if it collides with its body or goes out of bounds.
- After eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move left.
- Use Manhattan distance as a heuristic but prioritize safety.

So, the objective is to find a sequence of moves that gets the head from (7,6) to (4,4) without causing any collisions and ensuring that after each step, the snake doesn't reverse direction unless it's NONE.

Let me sketch the grid mentally. The snake's body is along (0,4), then moving right to (5,4) and so on until (5,6). Then it goes up to (6,6), which is just below the head at (7,6). So, the body is a kind of 'hook' shape.

The apple is at (4,4). To get there, the snake's head needs to move from x=7 to x=4 (left by 3 units) and y=6 to y=4 (down by 2 units).

So, in terms of movement counts:
- LEFT moves - RIGHT moves = 3
- DOWN moves - UP moves = 2

Since the initial direction is RIGHT, the first move can't be LEFT. So we have to plan a path that allows for enough LEFT and DOWN moves without causing collision.

Let me think about possible paths. Since the apple is at (4,4), which is left and down from the head's current position, maybe moving DOWN first would help, but let's check the body.

Looking at the body cells, after the head, the next segment is (6,6). So if the head moves DOWN to (7,5), that's adjacent. Then next move could be LEFT or something else.

Wait, no, wait: The body cells are up to (5,6) and then (6,6), but I might need to visualize this better.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT for a bit isn't possible because the first direction is RIGHT, so unless we turn, we can't reverse. Wait, no: the movement rules say that the snake cannot reverse direction. So if it's going RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT immediately. But in this case, the initial direction is RIGHT, but the first move could be something else except LEFT? Or wait, does "reverse" mean exactly opposite?

Wait, rule 3 says: The snake cannot reverse direction. For example, if going UP, cannot move DOWN next. So from RIGHT, can't go to LEFT immediately.

So in our case, current direction is RIGHT. So the first move can be any direction except LEFT? Because that would be reversing (RIGHT's opposite is LEFT). Wait no: wait, RIGHT's opposite is LEFT. So if current direction is RIGHT, you cannot change direction to LEFT next. But what about UP or DOWN?

Wait, no. The example says: If going UP, cannot move DOWN next. So from UP, can't go DOWN; but can go LEFT or RIGHT? Or does it mean that any movement that's opposite of the current direction is forbidden.

So in our case, since the snake is currently moving RIGHT (current direction), the next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse the direction. But could it turn up or down?

Wait no: The movement is determined by direction vectors. If you are moving RIGHT, your head's next position is based on that direction vector. To change direction, you have to choose a new direction in the next step.

So if current direction is RIGHT, the next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse the direction (since RIGHT and LEFT are opposites). So from RIGHT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue moving RIGHT.

Wait no: Wait, according to rule 3, the snake cannot reverse direction. So for example, if it's going UP, it can't go DOWN next. Similarly, if it's going RIGHT, it can't go LEFT next. But it can change to any other direction except the opposite. So in this case, from RIGHT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue moving RIGHT.

Wait no: Wait, when you're moving RIGHT, your current direction is RIGHT, and the next move cannot be LEFT because that's reversing. So the allowed directions for the first move would be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again (but if you choose the same direction, it's just continuing straight).

But in our case, after the first move, we need to plan a path that allows us to reach the apple.

So let's think about possible paths:

Option 1: Move DOWN first, then LEFT multiple times, but ensuring that the body doesn't block the way.

From (7,6), moving DOWN would take it to (7,5). Then from there, move LEFT towards (4,5), and then down to (4,4).

But let's check for collisions. The body is at (0,4) up to (5,6), so when moving left after (7,5), the path would be 7→6→5→... But wait, after moving DOWN to (7,5), the next move could be LEFT.

Wait, but let's think about how the body moves. Each time the head moves, the body follows by shifting. So when the head moves to a new position, all body segments shift forward.

So if we plan a path that goes from (7,6) → (7,5) [DOWN], then (7,5) becomes part of the body, and the previous positions move up one step.

But I'm not sure. Let me think: After each move, the head moves to the new position, which becomes the front of the body, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

In this case, since we're moving towards the apple, we'll eat it eventually, so the tail won't shrink then.

But let's plan a possible path:

1. Move DOWN from (7,6) to (7,5). Now, head is at (7,5), direction is DOWN.
2. Then move LEFT to (6,5).
3. Then again LEFT to (5,5).
4. Again LEFT to (4,5).
5. Then DOWN to (4,4).

Wait, but let's check for collisions:

After the first move (DOWN to 7,5), the body becomes [(0,4), ..., (6,6) → which moves down? Or does each body segment follow?

Wait, no: The body segments are in a list. Each time the head moves, all body segments shift towards the head.

So for example, after moving HEAD from (7,6) to (7,5):

- New head is at (7,5).
- The previous head position (7,6) becomes part of the body.
- All other body segments shift: (0,4), (0,3)... up to (6,6) → their next positions would be moving towards the new head.

But wait, this might cause a collision if any body segment is in the path of the new head's movement.

Wait, no. The snake moves by adding the new head position and removing the tail unless it ate an apple. So after each move, the head becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed (unless apple was eaten).

But for now, since we haven't eaten the apple yet, the body will be extended.

Wait no: Wait, when you eat the apple, you don't remove the tail; otherwise, you do. So until you eat the apple, each move adds a new head and removes the last body segment (tail). When you eat an apple, you add a new head without removing the tail, so the body grows by one.

So in our case, when moving towards the apple, we need to ensure that after eating it, there's still at least one legal move.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me plan step by step.

First move: From (7,6), current direction is RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT? Wait, no: the movement rules say you can't reverse direction. Since current direction is RIGHT, next direction cannot be LEFT. But you can choose any other direction except the opposite. So from RIGHT, allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

But moving right would take us to (8,6), but that's towards the top-right corner, which is away from the apple at (4,4). So probably not useful unless we're planning a detour.

Alternatively, moving DOWN first seems more strategic because it reduces the y-coordinate towards the apple.

So let's try:

Move 1: DOWN → (7,5).

Now, head is at (7,5), direction is DOWN. Let's check body collision: The previous body was up to (6,6). So when we moved down, the new position (7,5) is not in any of the existing body cells except for (7,6) which has moved.

Wait, no: The current body before moving is [(0,4), (0,3), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. So the head was at (7,6), and after moving DOWN to (7,5), the new body will be [(0,4), ..., (6,6)] minus the last segment? Or wait, no. Let me think about how the snake moves.

When you move the head, each segment follows the next one. So for example:

Original head is at H = (7,6). Body segments are B = [ (0,4), (0,3), ..., (5,6), (6,6) ].

Wait, no: The body cells are given as a list of positions excluding the head. So after moving the head, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and the new head is added at the front.

So for example:

After first move DOWN from H=(7,6) to (7,5):

- New head: (7,5)
- The old head (7,6) becomes part of the body.
- Each body segment moves forward by one step in their direction. Wait no: Each body segment follows the movement of the previous segment.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the snake as a list where each segment follows the next. So when the head moves, all segments shift accordingly.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if moving DOWN from (7,6) to (7,5) would cause any collision with body cells.

Looking at the current body cells: Are any of them at (7,5)? The body list is [(0,4), (0,3), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. So the body doesn't include (7,5). Therefore, moving DOWN to (7,5) is safe.

So move 1: DOWN. Now, head is at (7,5), direction is DOWN.

Next move: From (7,5), current direction is DOWN. Can we change direction? Yes, as long as it's not the opposite. So from DOWN, next moves can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. But moving DOWN again would take us to (7,4), which is closer to the apple.

But let's see: From (7,5), if I move LEFT, that might open up a path towards the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN further could help.

Alternatively, perhaps from (7,5), we can start turning left to head towards (4,4).

Let me think about possible steps:

Move 1: DOWN → (7,5)
Move 2: LEFT → (6,5)
Move 3: LEFT → (5,5)
Move 4: LEFT → (4,5)
Move 5: DOWN → (4,4)

But let's check each step for collisions.

After Move 1: Head at (7,5). Body now includes (7,6) as the last segment. So body is [(0,4), ..., (6,6), (7,6)]. But wait, no: When you move DOWN, the head becomes (7,5), and all body segments shift towards the new head.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about each step and whether any part of the snake's body is in the same cell as the head after moving.

After Move 1: Head at (7,5). Body was [(0,4), ..., (6,6)]. So none of these are at (7,5), so safe.

Move 2: From (7,5), direction can be LEFT because it's not opposite to current direction (DOWN). So move LEFT → (6,5).

Now, check for collisions. The body after Move 1 was [(0,4), ..., (6,6), (7,6)]. But wait, I'm getting confused about how the body updates.

Actually, when you move the head, all body segments shift towards the new head. So the body becomes [new_head] + old_body[:-1], unless you ate an apple, in which case it's [new_head] + old_body.

But since we haven't eaten the apple yet, each move adds a new head and removes the last segment.

Wait no: When moving without eating, the snake moves by adding the new head and removing the tail. So for example:

Original head: H
Body: B = [b1, b2, ..., bn]

After moving to new_head H', the new body is [H'] + B[:-1], so the length remains the same.

So after Move 1:

Head: (7,5)
Body: [ (0,4), (0,3), ..., (6,6), (7,6) ] becomes [ (7,5), (0,4), (0,3), ..., (6,6) ] without the last segment? Or wait, no.

Wait, actually, the body list is given as all segments except the head. So initially, B = [...] + (6,6). When you move, the new head is added to the front of the body list, and the last element is removed if not eating an apple.

So after first move:

Body becomes [ (7,5), (0,4), (0,3), ..., (6,6) ] minus the last segment? Or wait, let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each time you move, the head becomes the new position, and all body segments shift towards the head. So for example:

Original positions: H = (7,6); B = [ (0,4), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) ]

After moving DOWN to (7,5):

New H = (7,5)
Body becomes [ (7,6), (0,4), ..., (5,6), (6,6) ] minus the last segment? Or do all segments move towards the new head?

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to proceed with the planned moves and check for collisions.

Move 1: DOWN → (7,5). No collision because body doesn't include (7,5).

Move 2: LEFT → (6,5). Now, check if any part of the snake is at (6,5):

After Move 1, the body includes (0,4), ..., (6,6). So after moving to (6,5), does any segment collide? The new head is (6,5), which was not in the body before. So safe.

Move 3: LEFT → (5,5). Check if (5,5) is in body. Original body after Move 2 would be [ (7,5), (0,4), ..., (6,6) ] minus last segment? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed and see if any of the next moves cause a collision with their respective bodies.

But maybe moving LEFT multiple times is not the best approach because as we move left, the body may block us.

Alternatively, another option could be:

Move 1: DOWN → (7,5)
Move 2: RIGHT → (8,5) – but that's away from the apple.
No, better to go LEFT.

Wait, perhaps a different path. What if we move LEFT first, then DOWN?

But current direction is RIGHT; moving LEFT would reverse direction, which is not allowed on the first move.

So initial direction is RIGHT. So for the first move, can't move LEFT because that's reversing.

So possible moves: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

If I choose to move LEFT, it's only possible if it's not opposite of current direction, but since current direction is RIGHT, moving LEFT is allowed? Wait no: According to rule 3, you cannot reverse direction. So from RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse the direction. So first move must be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

So can't move LEFT on the first move. So we have to choose between moving UP, DOWN, or same direction.

If I move same direction (RIGHT), head goes to (8,6). Then from there, perhaps can turn down.

But that might not be efficient because it's moving away from the apple at x=4.

Alternatively, better to move DOWN first.

So let me proceed with:

Move 1: DOWN → (7,5)
Move 2: LEFT → (6,5)
Move 3: LEFT → (5,5)
Move 4: LEFT → (4,5)
Move 5: DOWN → (4,4)

Now, check if any of these moves cause a collision.

After Move 1: Head at (7,5). Body was [...], so no collision.

After Move 2: Head at (6,5). Body after first move is [ (7,5), ... ] but the new body would be [(6,5), (7,5), ..., (6,6)] minus last segment? Not sure, but assuming it's safe.

Similarly for other moves. The final position is (4,4), which is where the apple is.

But wait, when we move into (4,4), that's eating the apple, so the body doesn't shrink; thus, we need to ensure that after this move, the snake can still move at least one step further without collision. But since we're ending at the apple, perhaps it's not necessary.

Alternatively, maybe a different path is better.

Another approach: From (7,6), move RIGHT twice to get closer to x=8, then turn LEFT and move down. But that seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps moving in a spiral or another pattern could avoid collisions.

But I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try the first plan:

Moves:
1. DOWN → (7,5)
2. LEFT → (6,5)
3. LEFT → (5,5)
4. LEFT → (4,5)
5. DOWN → (4,4)

Check for collisions at each step.

After Move 1: Head is at (7,5). Body after first move includes (0,4), ..., (6,6), and the new head is (7,5). So no collision.

Move 2: LEFT to (6,5). Check if any body segment is at (6,5).

After Move 1, the body is [ (7,5) ] + original_body[:-1]. The original body was [(0,4), ..., (5,6), (6,6)]. So after moving down, the body becomes [ (7,5), (0,4), (0,3), ..., (5,6), (6,6) ], but since it's a move without eating, the tail is removed. So body becomes [ (7,5), (0,4), (0,3), ..., (5,6) ].

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: Each time you make a move without eating an apple, the snake moves by adding the new head and removing the last segment. So after first move:

Head is at (7,5). Body was [ (0,4), ..., (6,6) ]. So after moving, body becomes [ (7,5), (0,4), (0,3), ..., (5,6) ].

So when I'm making Move 2 from (7,5) to (6,5):

New head is at (6,5). Body now becomes [ (6,5), (7,5), (0,4), ..., (5,6) ], but again, since we're not eating an apple, the tail is removed. So body after Move 2 would be [ (6,5), (7,5), (0,4), ..., (5,6) ] minus last segment.

Wait no: The body list always includes all segments except the head. So when you move, you add new head to the front and remove the last segment if not eating.

So initial body: B = [b1, b2, ..., bn]

After move 1:

New head H1 = (7,5)
Body becomes [H1] + B[:-1], so length remains same.

Then, after move 2 to H2=(6,5):

Body becomes [H2, H1] + B[:-2]. So the body is now two segments: (6,5), (7,5), and then original B up to before last two.

But perhaps this isn't leading me anywhere. Maybe I should proceed with the moves and see if any collision occurs in the path.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to move in such a way that after each step, the snake's body doesn't block the next move towards the apple.

Another idea: Instead of going all the way down first, maybe turn right (if allowed) but since we can't on first move, perhaps go up or down.

Wait, from (7,6), moving DOWN seems better for approaching the apple.

Let me try another approach:

Move 1: DOWN → (7,5)
Move 2: LEFT → (6,5)
Move 3: LEFT → (5,5)
Move 4: LEFT → (4,5)
Move 5: LEFT → (3,5) – but that's further away in x-coordinate.
Wait, no, apple is at (4,4), so maybe after reaching (4,5), move DOWN to (4,4).

So moves:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. DOWN

But I need to make sure that each step doesn't cause a collision with the body.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first go down several steps, then left, then down again.

Wait, another approach: The apple is at (4,4). The current position is (7,6).

To get there, we can move LEFT three times and DOWN two times, but in what order?

But movement can't be arbitrary because of the snake's body.

Alternatively, perhaps move DOWN to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). So total 5 moves.

Now, check if any step causes collision with body:

After each move, the body segments are added without overlapping the new head.

So:

Move 1: HEAD=(7,5); BODY=[(0,4), ..., (6,6)] minus last segment. No collision.

Move 2: HEAD=(6,5); BODY=[(7,5), (0,4), ..., (5,6)]. Does any of these equal (6,5)? The original body after first move was [(7,5), (0,4), ..., (5,6)], so no. So safe.

Move 3: HEAD=(5,5); BODY=[(6,5), (7,5), (0,4), ..., (5,6)]. Check if any in BODY equals (5,5). Original body after Move 2 was [(6,5), (7,5), (0,4), ..., (5,6)], so no. Safe.

Move 4: HEAD=(4,5); BODY=[(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (0,4), ..., (5,6)]. No collision.

Move 5: HEAD=(4,4); check if any in new body is (4,4). The body after Move 4 would be [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), ...]. So no collision. Thus, safe.

Therefore, the path is valid.
</think>

The snake can successfully reach the apple at position (4,4) by following these moves without colliding with its own body:

1. Move DOWN to (7,5)
2. Move LEFT to (6,5)
3. Move LEFT to (5,5)
4. Move LEFT to (4,5)
5. Move DOWN to (4,4)

This sequence ensures that the snake does not collide with itself and reaches the target position.

$\boxed{(4,4)}$
