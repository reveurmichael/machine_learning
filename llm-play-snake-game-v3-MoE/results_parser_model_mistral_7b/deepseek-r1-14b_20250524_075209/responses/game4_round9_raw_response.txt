========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (2,4), and the apple is at (1,4). So, the head needs to move left because the x-coordinate of the apple is less than that of the head.

First, I notice that the current direction is "LEFT," which means the next move can't be "RIGHT" due to the no-reverse rule. That's important because it restricts our options for the first move.

Looking at the body cells, there's only one segment behind the head at (3,4). So, if we move left to (1,4), that would place the new head directly on the apple. Now, I need to check for collisions. The new head is within bounds since x=1 and y=4 are both valid.

Next, checking the body cells: after moving left, the old head (2,4) becomes the first body segment. Since the new head is at (1,4), it's not colliding with any other body segments except possibly when considering where the tail will move. However, since we're eating the apple, the tail won't move this turn, so no collision occurs.

After moving to the apple, the snake grows by one segment, making the body [(2,4), (3,4)]. Now, I need to ensure that after growing, there's at least one legal move next turn. Since the snake is now longer but still has space around it, and given that we're only taking one step, it should be manageable.

So, moving "LEFT" once will get us to the apple safely.
