Okay, so I have to plan a path for the snake to reach the apple without dying. Let's start by understanding the current state of the game.

The snake's head is at (4,2). The direction is currently "DOWN". The body cells are [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)]. So, the snake is moving down along the y-axis. The apple is at (1,9).

First, I need to figure out where the snake can move next. Since the current direction is "DOWN", which means it's moving towards higher x or lower y? Wait, no—directions are based on coordinate system: UP is y+1, DOWN is y-1, so moving down from (4,2) would take the head to (4,1). But the body segments are at increasing x from 4 to 8 while y remains 3. So, the snake's body is moving right along x-axis from x=4 to x=8, all at y=3.

Wait, actually, looking again: body cells are [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)]. So the head is at (4,2). The body starts right behind the head at (4,3) and extends to the right. So the snake's current position is a horizontal line at y=3 from x=4 to 8.

The goal is to reach (1,9), which is way up and to the left of the head. So, I need to make a plan that allows the snake to turn and move towards the apple without colliding with its body or going out of bounds.

Since the direction is currently "DOWN", the next move could be to go further down, but that might not help since we're trying to go up. Alternatively, maybe turning right or left would allow the snake to start moving upwards.

But wait, can the snake reverse direction? The rules say you cannot reverse unless it's the first move. Since the current direction is "DOWN", on the next move, it can't choose "UP" because that's a reversal. So the possible directions are either stay in place ("NONE"), or continue moving down, left, or right.

Wait, no—actually, according to the rules, you cannot reverse direction on the first move. But after that, you can change direction as long as it's not a reversal. For example, if current direction is "DOWN", next move can be "LEFT" or "RIGHT", but not "UP". So, from "DOWN", possible directions are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "NONE".

So, to get the snake to start moving upwards, it needs to first turn either left or right, then proceed upward. Let me think about how that would work.

First, let's see where the head can move safely. The head is at (4,2). Possible moves from here are:

- DOWN: (4,1)
- LEFT: (3,2)
- RIGHT: (5,2)
- NONE: stay at (4,2)

But since it just started moving down, maybe continuing down isn't helpful yet. Alternatively, turning left or right might allow the snake to start moving upwards towards the apple.

If I choose "RIGHT" as the first move, the head would go to (5,2). But then, the body needs to shift: the old head (4,2) is inserted at the front of the body list, which currently is [(4,3), ...]. So after moving right, the body becomes [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), ..., etc.], and the tail stays or moves depending on whether it eats the apple.

Wait, but moving to (5,2) might cause a collision because the body is at (4,3). The head is now at (5,2), which is not directly adjacent to any body part except possibly the next segment. Wait, no—body segments are [(4,3), (5,3), etc.], so (5,2) is one cell down from (5,3). So moving there wouldn't collide with the body.

But then, after that move, the snake's direction is "RIGHT". Next moves could be continuing right or turning up.

Alternatively, if I choose "LEFT" as the first move, head goes to (3,2). Then the body shifts, and now the snake can start moving left towards the apple. But from (3,2), moving left again would take it to (2,2), etc., but that might not directly lead towards the apple's y-coordinate of 9.

Wait, the apple is at (1,9). So the snake needs to move upwards a lot. So perhaps turning right initially and then moving up would be better.

Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. First move: "RIGHT" from (4,2) to (5,2).
2. Then, change direction to "UP". But wait, can the snake reverse direction after the first move? Yes, because after the first move, it's no longer the initial state. So from "RIGHT", next move could be "UP".

Wait, but I have to consider the movement rules carefully. After each move, the snake can choose any direction except a reversal. So, for example, if current direction is "RIGHT", next move cannot be "LEFT" because that would reverse. But after moving right, the snake can choose to go up, which isn't a reversal.

So, let's say:

1. Move RIGHT to (5,2).
2. Now, direction is "RIGHT". Next move could be "UP".
3. Move UP to (5,3). Wait, but (5,3) is already part of the body? No—the body after the first move would have shifted. Let me think:

After the first move, the body becomes [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), ..., etc.]. So if I then move UP to (5,3), that's where the body is at (5,3). So moving there would cause a collision because the head can't occupy a body segment except possibly the tail.

Wait, according to rule 2: If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies. So, in this case, (5,3) is a body segment, so moving there would be a collision.

Therefore, after the first move, the snake can't just move up to (5,3). It needs another direction.

Alternatively, from (5,2), maybe turning down again? But that's not helpful. Or perhaps moving left.

Wait, but moving left from (5,2) would take it back towards (4,2), which is the head after the first move. That might cause a collision as well.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Alternative idea: After moving right to (5,2), then try to move up as much as possible while avoiding colliding with the body.

But since the snake's body is at y=3 and higher x-values, perhaps turning down isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe after moving right, the snake can turn left or right again to create space.

Wait, let me think about the body positions. After the first move, the head is at (5,2), and the body is [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)]. So the snake's body is a horizontal line from x=4 to x=8 at y=3.

So, if the head is at (5,2), it's one cell below the segment at (5,3). Now, moving up would take it towards (5,4), but that's still below the body. So perhaps the snake can start moving upwards while shifting its body segments.

Wait, but each move involves growing or moving normally. If the head moves to (5,2) and then tries to move up to (5,3), that would be a collision because (5,3) is part of the body.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can start turning upwards by moving in such a way that it creates space for itself.

Another approach: Perhaps the snake needs to first move right as far as possible, then change direction up. But I'm not sure if that's feasible given the initial position.

Wait, perhaps the snake should turn left initially instead of right. Let me consider that:

1. Move LEFT from (4,2) to (3,2).
2. Now, the body becomes [(4,2), (4,3), ...]. So the snake is at x=3, y=2.

Then, perhaps moving UP from there.

But moving UP from (3,2) would take it to (3,3). Is that a collision? Let's see: The body has segments at (4,3), (5,3), etc. So (3,3) is adjacent but not occupied by the body yet. So moving there is safe.

After moving UP to (3,3), the body shifts again. Now, the head is at (3,3). The next move could be UP again, moving to (3,4).

But wait, I need to make sure that after each move, the snake doesn't collide with its own body.

Alternatively, perhaps turning left and then moving up would allow the snake to start moving towards the apple's y=9 position.

Wait, but from (3,2), moving UP leads to (3,3). Then, moving UP again to (3,4), and so on. That seems like a feasible path upwards.

But I also need to consider that the snake's body is at x=4 to 8, y=3. So as the head moves up from (3,2) to (3,3), it's not colliding with the body because the body is at higher x.

Wait, no—the body is at y=3 and x=4-8. The head is moving from y=2 to y=3 at x=3. So there's a gap between x=3 and x=4 at y=3, so that's safe.

So, possible path:

1. Move LEFT to (3,2).
2. Then, move UP repeatedly: (3,3), (3,4), ..., up to y=9.

But the problem is that the snake's body is still moving right along x=4-8 at y=3. So as the head moves up from (3,2) to (3,3), it needs to make space for the rest of the body to shift.

Wait, but when the head moves up to (3,3), the previous position (3,2) becomes part of the body. The next segments would be shifting towards the new head.

So after moving to (3,3), the body would have [(4,2), (4,3), ..., etc.] shifted left because the head is at x=3, y=3.

Wait, no—when the snake moves, the old head position becomes part of the body. So from (4,2) moving to (3,2), the new body starts with (4,2). Then when it moves up to (3,3), the body would be [(4,2), (4,3), ..., (5,3), ..., etc.] but now the head is at (3,3).

So from there, moving up further: (3,4), and so on.

This seems feasible. So the snake can turn left to face upwards and start moving towards the apple's location.

But wait, after turning left to (3,2), moving UP to (3,3) is possible, but then moving UP again would require the body segments to shift accordingly.

Another consideration: The snake needs to make sure that as it moves up, its body doesn't block itself. Since the initial body is at y=3 and x=4-8, moving the head up from (3,2) to (3,3) creates a gap above the body. Then, each subsequent UP move would have the snake's body following behind.

So, let me outline this step-by-step:

1. Initial position: Head at (4,2), body at [(4,3), (5,3), ..., (8,3)].
2. First move: LEFT to (3,2).
   - Body becomes [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (8,3)].
3. Next move: UP to (3,3).
   - Check for collision: Head is at (3,3). Body has (4,3) as the next segment. So no collision.
   - Body shifts: Now the body starts with (4,2), then (4,3) becomes part of the body, and so on. Wait, actually, each time the snake moves, the old head position is added to the front of the body.

So after moving LEFT, the body is [(4,2), (4,3), ..., (8,3)]. Then moving UP to (3,3):

- The new head is at (3,3). Check if this collides with any part of the body. Body segments are from x=4 to 8 at y=3, so no collision.
- Now, the snake's direction is UP, so next move could be continuing UP.

4. Next move: UP to (3,4).
   - Check for collision: Body is still at x≥4, y=3 and below. No collision.
   - The body shifts again, adding the previous head position (3,3) to the front.

5. Continue moving UP repeatedly until reaching y=9.

But wait, each time the snake moves UP, it's adding a new segment to its body. So as it moves up, the body follows behind. But since the apple is at x=1, y=9, the snake needs to move all the way left as well.

Wait, this seems like a problem because the snake's initial position has x from 3 (after first LEFT) up to higher x. To reach x=1, the snake would need to turn left again, but that might require reversing direction, which is not allowed unless it's the first move.

So, after moving up as far as possible, how can the snake turn left without reversing?

Wait, from UP direction, next moves could be LEFT or RIGHT, as long as they aren't reversals. So, from UP, the snake can choose to turn LEFT (which isn't a reversal) to start moving left towards x=1.

Yes! Because from UP, turning LEFT is allowed—it's not a reversal since current direction is UP and next is LEFT.

So, after reaching y=9, the snake needs to move LEFT as much as possible.

Let me outline this:

- After step 3: Head at (3,3), body from x=4 to 8 at y=3.
- Then, move UP repeatedly until y=9:
   - Move UP to (3,4)
   - Continue moving UP until head is at (3,9).
   - Each time, the snake's body shifts left as it moves up because each segment follows behind.
- Now, at (3,9), direction is UP. Next move could be LEFT without reversing.

But wait, at y=9, x=3. To get to x=1, the snake needs to move LEFT multiple times.

Each LEFT move from (x,y) would take it to (x-1,y). So starting from (3,9):

6. Move LEFT to (2,9).
   - Check for collision: Body is at x≥4, y≤9. Wait, body is still moving up as well. Let me think about the body's positions.

Wait, after each UP move, the snake's body shifts left because the head is moving up and left. So, when the head reaches (3,9), the body would be at x=4 to 8, y=9.

So, when moving LEFT from (3,9) to (2,9):

- Check if any part of the body is there. The body is at x=4 to 8, y=9. So no collision.
- Then, move LEFT again: from (2,9) to (1,9).
   - Now, check for collision: At y=9, x=1. Body is at x≥4, y=9. No collision.

Thus, the head can reach (1,9), which is the apple's position.

So, putting it all together:

1. Move LEFT to (3,2).
   - Direction becomes LEFT.
2. Move UP as much as possible:
   - Each move from (3,y) to (3,y+1) until reaching y=9.
3. Once at (3,9), change direction to LEFT (allowed because previous was UP and now turning LEFT is not a reversal).
4. Move LEFT twice: from (3,9) → (2,9) → (1,9).

This seems like a viable path.

But wait, let me verify if the body doesn't block itself when moving up. Each time the head moves up, the previous position becomes part of the body. So, for example:

- After first LEFT: head at (3,2), body from x=4 to 8, y=3.
- Then move UP to (3,3): body is now [(4,2), (4,3), ..., (8,3)] with new head at (3,3).
- Next, move UP again: check if (3,3) collides with any part of the body. The body starts at x=4, so no collision.
- Continue moving up until y=9.

Each time, the body shifts left because each segment follows behind as the head moves up and possibly left.

Wait, actually, when the snake moves UP, it's adding to the front of the body. So from (3,2) → (3,3), the new position is added to the body in front. So the body becomes [(4,2), (4,3), ..., (8,3), (3,3)]. But that doesn't make sense because the snake's body should be connected.

Wait no—when the head moves up, the next segment moves up as well. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Actually, each move involves shifting: when the head moves to a new position, the previous head position becomes part of the body, and the rest of the body shifts accordingly. So, after moving LEFT to (3,2), the body is [(4,2), (4,3), ..., (8,3)].

Then, moving UP to (3,3):

- The new body would be [(4,2), (3,2), (4,3), ..., (8,3)]. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body shifts.

I think each time the head moves, only the tail follows if it's a normal move, or grows if there's a collision. But in this case, since we're not eating the apple yet, it's a normal move, so the tail doesn't grow; the head moves, and the previous position becomes part of the body.

Wait no—actually, when the snake moves normally (not eating), the tail doesn't grow, but the head moves into a new cell, and the rest of the body follows behind. So, each move adds a new segment to the front, or shifts existing ones.

I think I need to clarify this: In snake movement, each time it moves forward, the head goes to the next cell, and all segments follow. The tail doesn't grow unless there's a collision or eating.

Wait no—no growth unless it eats something (which would cause the body to shift). So in normal movement, when the snake moves into a new cell, the rest of the body shifts forward, so each segment moves one cell forward.

But in this case, since we're not eating, the snake is just moving normally, so the tail doesn't grow. The head moves, and the rest follows. So the body's length remains the same unless it eats something or collides.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: When a snake moves forward, each segment behind the head moves one cell forward. So if the snake is straight, moving into a new cell causes all segments to shift forward, but no growth unless there's food or collision.

So in our case, the snake is not growing because it hasn't eaten anything yet. Therefore, when the snake moves LEFT from (4,2) to (3,2), the body follows behind, so the segment at (4,2) becomes part of the body, and the rest shifts accordingly.

Wait no—when moving, the head goes first, then each segment follows behind. So the tail doesn't move forward unless it's growing, which only happens when eating or colliding.

So perhaps I was wrong earlier—the snake's body length remains constant unless it eats something (which causes growth) or collides (causing retraction).

Therefore, in normal movement without eating or collision, the tail doesn't grow. The head moves into a new cell, and each segment follows behind, shifting forward as much as possible.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think differently: Each time the snake moves, it's adding a new segment to the front. So, after moving LEFT to (3,2), the body is [(4,2), (5,2), ..., (8,2)], but that doesn't make sense because the snake can't extend beyond its own length.

Wait no—probably, in normal movement without eating, the snake's body shifts as a whole. So if it moves into a new cell, the entire body follows behind, making each segment move one cell forward.

Therefore, when moving LEFT from (4,2) to (3,2), all segments shift left by one cell, so the tail at (8,2) moves to (7,2), etc. But that would require the snake's length to be 6 units, which is not specified here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach: To get the head to (1,9), the snake needs to move left from its starting position at x=4, y=2.

But perhaps it's better to consider that as long as the snake doesn't collide with itself or run into walls, it can keep moving in the chosen direction. So the key is finding a path where the snake's body remains connected without blocking itself.

So, back to the initial idea: Move LEFT first to (3,2), then move UP until y=9, then turn LEFT again to get to x=1 at y=9. This should work because each movement doesn't cause the snake to block itself, as it's just moving through empty spaces.

Therefore, the shortest path would be:

1. Move LEFT → (3,2)
2. Move UP → (3,3), (3,4), ..., up to (3,9)
3. Then, move LEFT twice: from (3,9) → (2,9) → (1,9)

So the snake successfully reaches the apple at (1,9).

I think this makes sense because each movement is straightforward and doesn't cause any collisions or require the snake to grow beyond its length.
</think>

To solve the problem of guiding the snake from its starting position at (4,2) to reach the apple located at (1,9), follow these steps:

1. **Move LEFT**: The snake moves from (4,2) to (3,2). This is the first move, changing the direction to face left.

2. **Move UP Repeatedly**: From (3,2), the snake continues moving upward:
   - To (3,3)
   - Then to (3,4)
   - Continue this until reaching y=9, ending at (3,9).

3. **Turn LEFT Again**: At (3,9), change direction to face left without reversing, as it's allowed from the previous UP direction.

4. **Move LEFT Twice**:
   - First move to (2,9)
   - Second move to (1,9)

By following these steps, the snake successfully navigates to the apple at (1,9).

### Final Answer
The shortest path for the snake is to first move left to (3,2), then up to (3,9), and finally left twice to reach (1,9). Thus, the final position is \boxed{(1, 9)}.
