========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given inputs:

- Current head position: (1, 2)
- Current direction: LEFT
- Body cells: [(3, 2), (2, 2)]
- Apple position: (1, 1)

## Step-by-step Analysis:
### Step 1: Understand Movement and Constraints

We need to determine a safe path from the head's current position at (1, 2) to the apple at (1, 1). We cannot reverse direction immediately if we're moving LEFT, so our first move can only be RIGHT or DOWN.

### Step 2: Check Possible Moves

- If we move RIGHT, the new head will be at (0, 2), which is out of bounds.
- If we move DOWN, the new head will be at (1, 1) where the apple is located.

Since moving DOWN directly leads us to the apple and doesn't cause any immediate collision with walls or body parts, this seems like a straightforward solution.

### Step 3: Verify Path Safety

1. Current position: (1, 2)
2. Move DOWN to (1, 1)

This path avoids:
- Collision with the snake's body.
- Moving out of bounds.

## Final JSON Output:

Based on our analysis and the constraints provided, here is the resulting JSON object:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Directly move DOWN from (1,2) to (1,1) where the apple is located."
}
```

This solution respects all movement rules, avoids collisions with walls and body parts, and achieves the goal of reaching the apple.
