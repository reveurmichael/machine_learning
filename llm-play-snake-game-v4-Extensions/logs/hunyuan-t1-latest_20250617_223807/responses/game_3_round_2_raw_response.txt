========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left (from x=5 to 3) and down (from y=7 to 2). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing direction and moves toward the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent DOWN moves reduce the y-coordinate. Each step checks for collisions with the body (initially only (5,6), then shifting body segments) and stays within grid bounds. After reaching the apple, the snake grows, and there are legal moves (e.g., LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) to avoid trapping."
