You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to get this snake from (3,5) to eat the apple at (2,5). The snake is currently moving up because its direction is "UP". So, it's going to move towards higher y-values. But wait, since it's already at y=5, moving up would take it to y=6. That doesn't help because the apple is at y=5. Hmm, so maybe I need to change direction.

The current body cells are [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2)]. So, the snake's head is at (3,5), then it has segments at (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), and (4,2). The tail is at (4,2). If I move "LEFT" from (3,5), that would take me to (2,5), which is the apple! But wait, can I do that?

I need to check if moving "LEFT" is possible. Let's see: new_head = (3-1, 5) = (2,5). Is this within grid bounds? Yes, because x=2 and y=5 are both between 0 and 9. Next, check for collisions. The current body cells don't include (2,5), so no collision there.

Now, after moving "LEFT", the new head is at (2,5). Since this is where the apple is, the snake grows by one segment. So, the body list will add the old head (3,5) to the front and keep all other segments. The tail stays at (4,2), so we don't remove it. That means the new body becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2)]. 

Wait, but after eating the apple, I need to ensure there's at least one move left. Let me think: after this move, the head is at (2,5). The next possible moves would be "UP" to (2,6) or "DOWN" to (2,4), etc., but since we just ate the apple and grew, maybe there are options. I should also check if any direction reversal occurs.

Originally, the snake was moving up, so reversing from "UP" to "LEFT" is allowed because it's a change in direction, not a 180-degree turn. So that should be fine.

So, the move "LEFT" seems safe and leads directly to eating the apple in one step.
</think>

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake can safely move left from (3,5) to (2,5), which is the position of the apple. This direction change is allowed as it doesn't reverse the previous movement and avoids collisions with body segments."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [(4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)], to eat the apple at (2, 5).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
