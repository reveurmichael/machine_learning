## BaseReplayEngine

In the python file "./replay/replay_engine.py", we have the class ReplayEngine. It should be used by task0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

## BaseGameManager

The whole BaseGameManager class should be used by task0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

## GameController
BaseGameController is really generic and can be used directly (or at least, almost directly) by task0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. At least, Task0 uses it directly (GameController is a subclass of BaseGameController, with inherites everything from BaseGameController and adds no extra functionality).


## An example of how to extend the codebase for Task1, Task2, Task3, Task4, Task5

The structural refactor of `core/` is now consistent with the roadmap:

1. Base-vs-Task-0 tiers  
   • `BaseGameData` / `GameData`  
   • `BaseGameController` / `GameController`  
   • `BaseGameManager` / `GameManager`  
   • `BaseRoundManager` / `RoundManager`  
   • `BaseGameLoop` / `GameLoop`  

   Every Task-0 subclass is concrete, exercised at runtime, and imports **only** its base—so there are no “abstract but unused” classes lingering.

2. No LLM-specific attributes live in the bases  
   We audited `Base*` classes; none contain `self.llm_*`, `self.time_stats`, `self.token_stats`, continuation-mode helpers, or sentinel counters (`empty_steps`, `something_is_wrong_steps`, …).  
   Their fields are strictly the generic ones you listed (grid, board, planned-moves, round tracking, etc.).

3. File-naming pattern respected  
   • Every file under `core/` is now `game_*.py` (controller, logic, loop, manager, data, stats, rounds).  
   • Utilities remain in `utils/*_utils.py`.

4. Inter-class dependencies are acyclic  
   • `BaseGameLoop` depends only on `BaseGameManager` and `GameLogic`, never the other way around.  
   • `GameManager` imports `GameLogic`, not the reverse.  
   • Round/Stats/Data classes sit at the leaves—no class higher in the stack imports them in a circular fashion.

5. Back-compat kept  
   • Public functions (`run_game_loop`) and concrete classes (`GameManager`, `GameController`, …) keep their original signatures and behaviour.  
   • All doc-strings and inline comments remain verbatim or have been expanded—nothing was trimmed.

6. Extension path proven  
   To add a heuristic agent tomorrow:  
   ```python
   class HeuristicGameManager(BaseGameManager):
       def __init__(self, args):
           super().__init__(args)
           self.agent = BFSAgent(...)
   ```
   The existing `GameLoop` (still instantiated via `run_game_loop(self)`) will automatically fall into the agent path; no Task-0 specific code is executed.

If you spot a file under `core/` that still mixes LLM-specific fields into a base, let me know and we’ll lift them into the Task-0 subclass; otherwise the folder is SOLID-ready for Tasks 1-5.
