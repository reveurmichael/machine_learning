{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (1,8) with direction RIGHT. To reach the apple at (2,1), the snake needs to move right once and down seven times. The first move RIGHT to (2,8) avoids body collisions. Subsequent DOWN moves (to (2,7), (2,6), ..., (2,1)) are safe as the body shifts upward each time, leaving the path clear. The final move to (2,1) eats the apple, and the snake can continue moving down afterward without immediate collision."
