========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 8 units right (x from 1→9) and 3 units up (y from 2→5). Starting with RIGHT moves avoids immediate body collisions and progresses toward the apple's x-coordinate. After reaching (9,2), moving UP aligns with the apple's y-coordinate, avoiding body segments. This path ensures safe progression without reversing direction and leaves valid moves after eating the apple."
