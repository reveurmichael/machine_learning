{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,5) with a horizontal body along y=6. To reach the apple at (6,1), the snake needs to move right (increasing x by 6) and down (decreasing y by 4). Moving RIGHT first avoids collision with the body (which is above the head) and progresses toward the apple's x-coordinate. After reaching (6,5), moving DOWN 4 times aligns with the apple's y-coordinate. Each move is safe as the new head does not collide with the body or grid boundaries, and after eating the apple, there are valid subsequent moves."
