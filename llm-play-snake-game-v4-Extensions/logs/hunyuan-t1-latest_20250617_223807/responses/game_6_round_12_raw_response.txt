{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (9,4) with direction RIGHT. First, move DOWN to (9,3) (avoiding RIGHT which is out of bounds and UP which would move into body-adjacent cells). Then move DOWN to (9,2) to align with the apple's y-coordinate. From there, move LEFT 8 times to reach (1,2), the apple's position. These moves avoid collisions with the snake's body, which is initially clustered in higher x and y coordinates, and ensure a legal path after eating the apple (next move LEFT to (0,2) is safe)."
