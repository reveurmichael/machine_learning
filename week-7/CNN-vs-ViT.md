Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent two dominant paradigms in computer vision: CNNs rely on localized convolutional filters and hierarchical feature maps, while ViTs leverage global self-attention over image patches. CNNs possess strong spatial inductive biases—translation equivariance and locality—which make them data-efficient and computationally lighter, especially on modest datasets and edge devices  ([[PDF] A comparative study between vision transformers and CNNs ... - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00389?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Vision Transformers vs CNNs at the Edge](https://www.edge-ai-vision.com/2024/03/vision-transformers-vs-cnns-at-the-edge/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). In contrast, ViTs exhibit weaker inductive biases but greater flexibility, capturing long-range dependencies more directly; they often require large-scale pretraining or heavy regularization to match CNN performance on smaller datasets  ([Vision Transformers (ViT) in Image Recognition: Full Guide - viso.ai](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/vision-transformer-vit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Vision transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Empirically, ViTs can outperform CNNs in accuracy and shape bias when pretrained on billions of images, yet CNNs remain preferable for dense prediction, low-resource, or real-time applications  ([CNN vs. Vision Transformer: A Practitioner's Guide to Selecting the ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1cu3pnw/cnn_vs_vision_transformer_a_practitioners_guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Comprehensive comparison between vision transformers and ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72254-w?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Understanding these trade-offs helps practitioners choose the right architecture based on dataset size, computational budget, and task requirements.

## Architecture Overview

### CNNs: Localized Convolutions  
- **Convolutional layers** apply small kernels (e.g., 3×3) across the image, enforcing **local connectivity** and **translation equivariance**.  
- **Hierarchical feature maps** emerge by stacking layers, with deeper filters capturing increasingly abstract patterns (edges → textures → objects).  
- **Strong inductive bias** reduces parameter needs and improves data efficiency, but may struggle to aggregate global context early in the network  ([[PDF] A comparative study between vision transformers and CNNs ... - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00389?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### Vision Transformers: Patch-Based Self-Attention  
- **Patch embedding** splits an image into non-overlapping patches (e.g., 16×16), linearly projects each into a token vector, and adds positional encodings.  
- **Transformer encoder** blocks apply multi-head self-attention across all patches, allowing **global interactions** from the first layer onward.  
- **Weaker inductive bias** grants flexibility in representation learning, but necessitates **large datasets** or **strong regularization** to prevent overfitting  ([Vision transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Vision Transformers (ViT) in Image Recognition: Full Guide - viso.ai](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/vision-transformer-vit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## Use Cases & Practical Considerations

- **Edge and Mobile**: CNNs (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientNet) dominate due to efficiency; ViT variants with efficient attention (e.g., Swin Transformer) are emerging alternatives.
