========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this Snake problem step by step. The goal is to get the head from (5,5) to (7,0), which is the apple's position. First, I'll map out the grid and see where everything is.

So, the snake starts at (5,5). The apple is at (7,0). That means I need to move right twice and down five times to reach the apple. But wait, in the classic Snake game, each move shifts the head and the body follows, so I have to be careful not to collide with my own body.

Looking at the initial state, the snake's body is just the head at (5,5). So it's a length-1 snake. That means I can move freely without worrying about hitting myself. But as I start moving, the body will extend behind me, so I need to plan ahead to avoid collisions.

Now, considering directions: the current direction is "NONE", which means on the first move, I can choose any direction—up, down, left, or right. Since the apple is at (7,0), which is two units to the right and five units down from the head, it makes sense to go right first to start moving towards the apple.

Wait, but if I go right from (5,5) to (6,5), then next move right again to (7,5). That's still not at (7,0). Then, from there, I need to move down five times. But each time I move down, my body will be getting longer, so I have to ensure that none of these moves cause the head to collide with any part of the snake.

However, moving right and then down might put me in a position where the tail is blocking the path. Let's think about it: after eating the apple, the body doesn't move, but before that, each move removes the tail unless I eat the apple. So I need to make sure that when I'm near the apple, I don't get trapped.

Another thing to consider is that once I eat the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so if I have to make a U-turn later, I might not have enough space. But in this case, moving straight right then down should work because the apple is two units to the right and five units down from (5,5). Wait, no—7-5=2 for x, 0-5=-5 for y. So it's two right and five down.

But after each move, I have to check if the new head position is within the grid and not colliding with any body segments except possibly the tail that will move next. Since initially, the snake is just the head, this isn't an issue until the snake starts growing.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT to (6,5). Now, body becomes [(5,5)], since it's length 1.
2. Move RIGHT again to (7,5). Body is still [(5,5)] because we didn't eat the apple yet.
3. Now, from (7,5), I need to move down. Let's check if this is possible.

Wait, after moving right twice, the head is at (7,5). The apple is at (7,0), which is five units down. So each move down will take me closer, but I have to make sure that my body isn't blocking the path.

Each time I move down, the head moves to (7,4), then (7,3), etc., until reaching (7,0). But as I move down, my body segments are added behind me. So after each move, the old head becomes part of the body.

Let's see:

- After moving right twice, the snake is at (7,5) with a body of [(5,5), (6,5)].
Wait no, actually, after each right move, the head moves to (6,5), then to (7,5). So the body would be:

After first RIGHT: body becomes [(5,5)], because it's length 1 and only adds the old head.

Wait, no—the initial snake is just the head. When moving right, the new head is (6,5). Then, since there was no collision, we insert the old head at the front of the body list. So body becomes [(5,5)] and then the tail doesn't move because it's not an apple yet. Wait, but in the movement example, when moving normally, after inserting the old head, if it's not an apple, the tail is removed.

Wait, let me clarify:

In each move, after checking for collision, we:

a) Insert old head at front of body list.
b) If new_head is apple, grow (don't remove tail).
c) Else, remove last element of body (tail).

So, initially, body is empty. After moving right from (5,5), new_head is (6,5). Check collision: no, since body is empty.

Then:

a) Insert old head (5,5) at front ⇒ body becomes [(5,5)].
b) Since it's not the apple, remove tail → body becomes empty again. Wait, but that can't be right because if you start with a length-1 snake, moving right would make the body add the previous head and then remove the tail? That doesn't make sense.

Wait no—the initial snake is just the head. So when it moves, the new_head is (6,5). Then, since there's no collision, we insert the old head at front of body list. Since the body was empty before, inserting gives [(5,5)]. Then, since it didn't eat the apple, we remove the tail, which was nothing—so the body remains as [(5,5)].

Wait, that seems off because if you have a length-1 snake and move right, your body should be [(5,5), (6,5)]? Or is it handled differently?

Looking back at the movement example: when S = [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)], moving LEFT gives new_head (3,4). Then, insert old head (4,4) at front of BODY ⇒ [(4,4), (4,3)]. Then, remove tail if not eating apple ⇒ [(4,4)].

Wait, so when the body has multiple segments, you insert the old head and then remove the tail. But in our case, initial body is empty. So moving right:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head (5,5) at front ⇒ [(5,5)].
- Since no apple, remove tail → but there was nothing to remove? Or does the body become [(5,5)].

This is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Each move:

1. Compute new_head based on direction.
2. Check collision with boundaries and body (excluding future moves).
3. If safe:
   a. Insert old head into body list at front.
   b. If new_head is apple, grow: do not remove tail.
   c. Else, remove last element of body.

So initially, body is empty.

After first move right:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head ⇒ [(5,5)].
- Since no apple, remove last element of body ⇒ but there are none to remove, so body remains [(5,5)]?

Wait, that can't be because the body should now have one segment behind the new head. So after moving right, the snake's body would be [(5,5), (6,5)], making it length 2.

But according to step c, if not eating apple, remove last element of body. But initial body is empty—so perhaps when the snake is length 1, moving right will result in body being [(5,5)] and then adding the new head at front, making it [(5,5), (6,5)], but since no apple, we remove the last element, which is (6,5)? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at the movement example again.

In the example where S = [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)] and moving LEFT:

- new_head = (3,4)
- No collision.
- Insert old head ⇒ [(4,4), (4,3)]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail ⇒ [(4,4)]

So, body becomes [(4,4)], which is the old head followed by BODY1. So in this case, the new_head is (3,4). Then, after inserting, we have [old_head, BODY1], and then removing the last element (BODY1) if not growing.

Wait, so in general:

- When moving normally, after inserting the old head at front, we remove the last element of the body list, which was the tail. So the body segments shift forward.

Therefore, in our initial case with length 1 snake:

- Move right: new_head = (6,5)
- Insert old head ⇒ [(5,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element ⇒ but there is none to remove. So the body remains [(5,5)]?

But that would mean the snake's body didn't grow. Hmm, perhaps in this case, when moving normally with a length-1 snake, after inserting, we have [(old_head)], then since no tail to remove, it stays as such. But that seems incorrect because the snake should be growing by one segment.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me re-examine the rules:

3. **Update body positions** (assuming no collision and within bounds):  
   a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1).  
   b. If new_head == apple position, **grow**: do not remove the tail this turn (BODY length increases by 1).  
   c. Otherwise, **move normally**: remove the last element of BODY (the tail) so total length remains the same.

So, when not eating the apple:

- Insert old head at front.
- Remove last element.

Therefore, the body list's length stays the same as before moving.

Wait, if the snake was length n before moving, after this process, it remains length n because we add one and remove one. But that doesn't make sense because in reality, the snake grows when eating the apple.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding: maybe "BODY" includes all segments behind the head. So when you insert the old head at front, the body becomes [old_head] + existing BODY, then if not growing, remove the last element (the tail).

Therefore:

- Initial state: HEAD= (5,5), BODY= empty.
- After move right:
   - new_head = (6,5)
   - Check collision: safe
   - Insert old head ⇒ BODY becomes [(5,5)]
   - Since not apple, remove last element ⇒ BODY becomes empty.

Wait, that would mean the snake lost a segment. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps when you insert the old head at front, then the existing body is still present behind. So after moving right:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Insert old head ⇒ [(5,5)] followed by existing BODY.
But since initial body is empty, it remains [(5,5)].

Then, if not eating apple, remove last element of BODY, which is the tail. But there's no tail because the body was empty—so perhaps we add a new segment?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think differently.

Let me consider that each move shifts the head and either grows or moves normally:

- Starting with HEAD= (5,5), BODY= empty.
- Move right: new_head = (6,5)
   - No collision
   - Insert old head ⇒ [(5,5)]
   - Since not apple, remove last element of body ⇒ but no elements to remove. So the body remains [(5,5)].

But that doesn't make sense because now the snake is still length 1, but it should have a segment at (6,5). Maybe I'm missing the point.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving normally, you add the old head and then shift the body segments forward by removing the tail. So in this case:

- After inserting [(5,5)], the existing body was empty.
- Then, since not growing, remove last element ⇒ but there is none to remove, so effectively, the snake has a new segment at (6,5), and the old head is at front.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when moving normally, the body shifts forward by one segment, and the new_head is added as the new front. So:

- Initial state: HEAD= (5,5), BODY= empty.
- Move right: new_head = (6,5)
   - No collision
   - Insert old head ⇒ [(5,5)]
   - Then, remove last element of body ⇒ but there's nothing to remove, so effectively, the body becomes [(5,5)], and then the new_head is (6,5). So after this move, the snake has a body segment at (5,5) and the head at (6,5).

Wait, that makes sense. Because in the example where S = [HEAD, BODY1], moving LEFT results in:

- Insert old head ⇒ [HEAD, BODY1]
- Remove last element ⇒ [HEAD]

So similarly, when starting with only HEAD, after move right:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Insert old head ⇒ [(5,5)]
- Then, since not growing, remove last element ⇒ but there's nothing to remove. So the body is just [(5,5)], and the head is at (6,5). So in this case, the snake has grown by one segment.

Therefore, after first move right, the snake is length 2: segments at (5,5) and (6,5), with head at (6,5).

Got it. Now, continuing:

2. Move right again to (7,5). Let's see:

- new_head = (7,5)
- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head ⇒ [(5,5), (6,5)] from previous move?
Wait no—after first move, the snake was at (6,5) with body [(5,5)]. So moving right again:

- new_head = (7,5)
- Insert old head ⇒ insert (6,5) into front of body list. But wait, current body is [(5,5)], so inserting (6,5) would make it [(6,5), (5,5)].
- Then, since not eating apple, remove last element ⇒ [(6,5)].

So after second move right:

- Head at (7,5)
- Body is [(6,5)]
- So total length is 2 again?

Wait, no—let me recount:

After first move right:

- HEAD = (6,5)
- BODY = [(5,5)]

Second move right:

- new_head = (7,5)
- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head ⇒ body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)]
- Since not apple, remove last element ⇒ body becomes [(6,5)]

So now, HEAD is at (7,5), and BODY is [(6,5)].

Thus, the snake's body has two segments: one at (6,5) and head at (7,5).

Wait, no—BODY is [(6,5)], so there's only one segment behind the head. So total length is 2: head and one body segment.

Continuing this way, each time I move right, the snake gains a new segment but loses the oldest one. But since I'm not eating the apple yet, the body remains at length 1 after each normal move.

Now, from (7,5), I need to start moving down towards (7,0). Let's see:

3. Move down to (7,4):

- new_head = (7,4)
- Check collision: current body is [(6,5)].
   - Is (7,4) colliding with any part of the body? The body is at (6,5), which is not in the same row or column as (7,4). So no collision.

Proceed:

- Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,5) into front of body. Current body was [(6,5)], so inserting gives [(7,5), (6,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element ⇒ [(7,5)]

So now, HEAD is at (7,4), BODY is [(7,5)].

Length is 2 again.

Next move down:

4. Move to (7,3):

- new_head = (7,3)
- Check collision: body is [(7,5)]. (7,3) and (7,5) are on same column but different rows—no collision.
- Insert old head ⇒ [(7,3), (7,5)]
Wait no—current body before insertion is [(7,5)], so inserting new_head's previous position (7,4):

Wait, no—the old head is the one just moved. So in this move:

- After computing new_head = (7,4)
- Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,5) into front of body. So body becomes [(7,5), ... ] + existing body.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify step by step:

Each move:

1. Compute new_head based on direction.
2. Check collision: does new_head collide with current body (excluding any future moves).
3. If safe:
   a. Insert old head into front of body list.
   b. If new_head is apple, grow (don't remove tail).
   c. Else, remove last element from body.

So in step 4:

- Moving down from (7,5) to (7,4)
   - new_head = (7,4)
   - Check collision: safe because body is [(6,5)].
      Wait, no—after second move right, body was [(7,5)], but actually after the first two moves right:

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled. Let me track each step carefully.

Let's create a table:

Move 1: Right from (5,5) to (6,5)
- HEAD = (6,5)
- BODY: Insert old head ⇒ [(5,5)], then since not apple, remove tail ⇒ [(5,5)] (BODY remains as [(5,5)] after inserting and removing? No—wait:

Wait, initial move right from (5,5):

- new_head = (6,5)
- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head ⇒ body becomes [(5,5)]
- Since not apple, remove last element of body ⇒ but there's none to remove. So BODY remains [(5,5)].

But that would mean the snake didn't grow, which contradicts the movement example.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving normally with a length-1 snake:

- After inserting old head at front, you have a new segment.
- Then, since not growing, you remove the last element (which is nothing), so effectively, the snake has grown by one segment.

Therefore, after first move right, HEAD = (6,5), BODY = [(5,5)].

Move 2: Right from (6,5) to (7,5)
- new_head = (7,5)
- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head ⇒ body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)]
- Since not apple, remove last element ⇒ [(6,5)]

So now:

- HEAD = (7,5)
- BODY = [(6,5)]

Move 3: Down from (7,5) to (7,4)
- new_head = (7,4)
- Check collision: body is at (6,5), which is not in same row or column. Safe.
- Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,5) into front of body. Body was [(6,5)], now becomes [(7,5), (6,5)]
- Since not apple, remove last element ⇒ [(7,5)]

So:

- HEAD = (7,4)
- BODY = [(7,5)]

Move 4: Down to (7,3)
- new_head = (7,3)
- Check collision: body at (7,5) is same row but different column. Safe.
- Insert old head ⇒ [(7,3), (7,5)]
- Remove last element ⇒ [(7,3)]

So:

- HEAD = (7,3)
- BODY = [(7,4)]

Wait, no—wait. After move 3, body was [(7,5)]. Then in move 4:

- Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,5) into front of body, which is [(7,5), ... ]? Wait, the body before insertion is [(7,5)], so inserting (7,5) would make it [(7,5), (7,5)]?

No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, each time you move, you insert the old head into the front of the body and then remove the last element if not growing.

So in move 3:

- After moving to (7,4):

   - Insert old head ⇒ [(7,5), (6,5)] but no—wait, before insertion, the body was [(6,5)]. Then inserting (7,5) makes it [(7,5), (6,5)]. Then since not growing, remove last element ⇒ [(7,5)].

So after move 3:

- HEAD = (7,4)
- BODY = [(7,5)]

Move 4: Down to (7,3):

   - new_head = (7,3)
   - Check collision: body is at (7,5). Safe.
   - Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,4) into front of body. So before insertion, body was [(7,5)]. After inserting, it becomes [(7,4), (7,5)].
   - Since not apple, remove last element ⇒ [(7,4)]

So now:

- HEAD = (7,3)
- BODY = [(7,4)]

Similarly, next move down:

Move 5: Down to (7,2):

   - new_head = (7,2)
   - Check collision: body at (7,4). Safe.
   - Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,3) into front of body. Body was [(7,4)], now becomes [(7,3), (7,4)].
   - Remove last element ⇒ [(7,3)]

So:

- HEAD = (7,2)
- BODY = [(7,3)]

Move 6: Down to (7,1):

   - new_head = (7,1)
   - Check collision: body at (7,3). Safe.
   - Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,2) into front of body. Body was [(7,3)], now becomes [(7,2), (7,3)].
   - Remove last element ⇒ [(7,2)]

So:

- HEAD = (7,1)
- BODY = [(7,2)]

Finally, to reach (7,0):

Move 7: Down to (7,0):

   - new_head = (7,0)
   - Check collision: body at (7,2). Safe.
   - Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,1) into front of body. Body was [(7,2)], now becomes [(7,1), (7,2)].
   - Since not apple, remove last element ⇒ [(7,1)]

So after this move:

- HEAD = (7,0)
- BODY = [(7,1)]

Now, the snake has reached (7,0). To eat the apple at (7,0), it needs to grow by one segment.

But wait, in our movement so far, we haven't eaten the apple. So if I want the snake to eat the apple at (7,0), I need to make that position its head.

So perhaps:

After move 6: HEAD = (7,1), BODY = [(7,2)]

Then, on next move, it moves to (7,0) and eats the apple.

But in reality, the snake would have to stop at (7,1) before eating. Wait, no—the snake can only eat when it's at the same position as the apple.

So let me adjust:

Let me think of the apple at (7,0). The snake needs to be at (7,0) to eat it.

To get there, the last move is from (7,1) to (7,0).

But if I make that move, the new_head will be (7,0), which is where the apple is. Therefore, when processing this move:

- new_head = (7,0)
- Check collision: safe because body is at (7,2).
- Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,1) into front of body. Body was [(7,2)], now becomes [(7,1), (7,2)].
- Since new_head is on apple, grow by not removing the tail.

Therefore:

- HEAD = (7,0)
- BODY remains as [(7,1), (7,2)]

Thus, the snake has grown to length 4: head at (7,0), body segments at (7,1) and (7,2).

But wait, in reality, when a snake eats an apple, it grows by one segment. So if the snake was of length n before eating, after eating, it's length n+1.

In our case:

- Before move 7: HEAD = (7,1), BODY = [(7,2)]
   - Total segments: 2
- During move 7, new_head = (7,0)
   - Check collision: safe.
   - Insert old head ⇒ insert (7,1) into front of body. Body becomes [(7,1), (7,2)]
   - Since it's the apple, do not remove tail ⇒ body remains [(7,1), (7,2)]

Therefore, after eating:

- HEAD = (7,0)
- BODY = [(7,1), (7,2)]

Total length: 3 (head + two body segments). So the snake has grown by one segment.

Thus, the final positions are:

- HEAD at (7,0)
- Body segments at (7,1) and (7,2)

But in reality, after eating, the snake should have a new head at (7,0), with the previous head becoming the next body segment. So the segments would be:

- New head: (7,0)
- Next segment: (7,1) (old head)
- Then: (7,2)

Therefore, the final positions are correct as above.

So in conclusion, to have the snake reach and eat the apple at (7,0), it must make a series of right moves followed by down moves, ending with a move to (7,0) where it eats the apple, growing by one segment. The final body segments are at (7,1) and (7,2).

But in terms of the answer, I think we just need to specify that the snake's head is at (7,0), which is the position of the apple.

So, after all moves, the snake's head is at (7,0). Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{(7,0)}.
</think>

To solve the problem of determining the final position of the snake's head after it eats the apple, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. The snake starts at position (5,5) and moves right and down to reach the apple located at (7,0). Each move involves checking for collisions with the body segments, inserting the old head into the front of the body, and removing the tail unless the snake eats the apple.

1. **Initial Position**: The snake is at (5,5) with an empty body.
2. **Move Right to (6,5)**: Insert (5,5) as the first body segment and remove nothing since it's not eating yet. Now, head is at (6,5), body is [(5,5)].
3. **Move Right to (7,5)**: Insert (6,5) into the front of the body. Body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)]. Remove last segment, leaving [(6,5)]. Head moves to (7,5).
4. **Move Down to (7,4)**: Insert (7,5) into the front of the body. Body becomes [(7,5), (6,5)]. Remove last segment, leaving [(7,5)]. Head moves to (7,4).
5. **Move Down to (7,3)**: Insert (7,4) into the front of the body. Body becomes [(7,4), (7,5)]. Remove last segment, leaving [(7,4)]. Head moves to (7,3).
6. **Move Down to (7,2)**: Insert (7,3) into the front of the body. Body becomes [(7,3), (7,4)]. Remove last segment, leaving [(7,3)]. Head moves to (7,2).
7. **Move Down to (7,1)**: Insert (7,2) into the front of the body. Body becomes [(7,2), (7,3)]. Remove last segment, leaving [(7,2)]. Head moves to (7,1).
8. **Move to Apple at (7,0)**: Insert (7,1) into the front of the body. Since this is where the apple is, do not remove the tail. Now, head is at (7,0), body remains [(7,1), (7,2)].

Thus, after eating the apple, the snake's head is at position \boxed{(7,0)}.
