========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 2 units right (from x=6 to 8) and 4 units up (from y=2 to 6). Starting with RIGHT avoids reversing the initial DOWN direction. Moving RIGHT twice aligns the head horizontally with the apple, then moving UP four times reaches the apple. Each step checks for collisions with the body (initially only (6,3), which shifts safely) and stays within bounds. After eating the apple, the snake's body remains continuous with space to move next turn."
