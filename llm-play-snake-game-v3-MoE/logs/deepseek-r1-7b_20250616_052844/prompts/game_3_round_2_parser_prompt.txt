<think>
Okay, I need to figure out a path for the snake from (5,5) towards (4,8). The apple is at (4,8), which is 1 unit left and 3 units up from the head. So according to the final position check, I should have more left moves than right by 1 and more up moves than down by 3.

First, let's consider movement rules:
- The snake can't reverse direction on its first move.
- It must avoid colliding with walls or itself unless it's about to eat an apple.
- After eating the apple, there should be at least one legal move next turn.

Given that the body is currently empty (since body list is []), moving directly towards the apple seems possible without worrying about collision with its own body. So I can start by considering moves like LEFT and UP repeatedly.

But wait, the snake's initial direction is NONE. So any first move is allowed. If it starts moving left or right or up or down, that should be fine as long as it doesn't hit a wall immediately. Since (5,5) isn't near the edges except for x=5 which is in the middle of 10x10 grid.

Let me map out possible initial moves:
- LEFT: new_head would be (4,5). That's within bounds and no body yet.
- RIGHT: goes to (6,5), but that might be further away from apple at (4,8).
- UP: (5,6)
- DOWN: (5,4)

Moving left first seems optimal since it gets closer in x-coordinate. So let's plan a series of LEFT moves followed by UP.

But need to ensure after each move there are no collisions with body segments or walls.

Wait, but the initial direction is NONE. So moving left should be allowed without any issues since there's no body yet.

Let me simulate step-by-step:

1. Move LEFT: new_head = (4,5)
   - Check collision: no head overlap except maybe tail in next move.
   - Update body by adding (5,5) to front and remove tail if not eating apple.
   - Since direction was NONE, first move can be left.

2. Next moves could continue LEFT until x=4-3=1? Wait, but the target is at x=4, so once head is at (4, y), moving further left would take it beyond 0, which isn't allowed because of wall collision.

Wait no: from (5,5) to (4,5): that's one LEFT. Then from (4,5), another LEFT would go to (3,5). Then to (2,5)... but apple is at x=4, so moving left once more might be too far.

Alternatively, maybe after some LEFT moves, switch to UP to make progress in y-direction towards 8.

But need to ensure that each move doesn't cause any collision with the snake's body. Since the snake hasn't moved yet (body list is empty except for head), as long as we don't move into a position where the new_head overlaps with any existing body, which isn't an issue here since there are no body cells.

Wait, but after each move, the body segments shift forward by one. So moving left once would make the snake's body at (5,5) then (4,5). Then next move will add that as the new front and remove any tail if necessary.

So initial moves:

1. LEFT: head to (4,5)
   - Body becomes [(4,5), (5,5)] but wait no. Wait step 3c says when not eating apple, body removes last element.
   
Wait correction: When moving normally (not eating), the snake's tail is removed.

So starting from [] as the body list:

After first move LEFT:
- new_head = (4,5)
- Insert old head (5,5) at front → body becomes [(5,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element of body: but it was empty except for inserting. Wait no.

Wait initial state is S = [head], and body list is empty. So when moving:

new_head = (4,5)
Insert old head (5,5) at front → body becomes [(5,5)]
Then since not eating apple, remove tail → but there's no tail to remove because the snake is now two segments: head (4,5) and next segment (5,5). Wait wait.

Wait initial S after first move:

After step 3a: insert old head at front of body list. Since initial body was empty, it becomes [(5,5)].
Step 3b: if not eating apple, remove last element → now the body is [ ] again? But then the new S would be [new_head (4,5), followed by nothing] which isn't possible.

Wait no: The initial state has snake represented as [head], and body list is empty. So when moving:

1. Compute new head.
2. Check collision.
3a. Insert old head at front of body → becomes [old_head].
3b. If not eating apple, remove tail (which doesn't exist since body was empty except for the inserted head). So body after step 3 is empty again.

Wait that's a problem because S should be [new_head] + body. But if you insert old_head and then remove it, then you end up with only new_head as the next snake's segments? That can't be right.

I think I'm misunderstanding how the body list works when initially empty. Let me re-read:

The example given: S = [(4,4), (4,3)]. The body cells are from behind head to tail, excluding head and tail.

Wait in this case, if the initial snake is only the head with no body, then after moving left once, how does it update?

Original full S before move was [head], and body list is empty. After move:

new_head = (4,5)
Insert old head into front of body → body becomes [(5,5)]
Then since not eating apple, remove tail: but the body has only one element (the new head), so after removal, body is empty.

Thus S after move would be [new_head], which is correct because the snake hasn't grown. So when moving and not eating, the length remains 1? But that can't be right since movement rules say:

"Update body positions [...] a. Insert old head at front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1). b. If new_head == apple position, grow: do not remove tail this turn. Otherwise, move normally: remove last element."

So when initial body is empty and you don't eat, after inserting head into body:

body becomes [old_head], then removing last → body is empty.

Hence S = [new_head], which is correct because the snake hasn't grown (no apple eaten).

But in this case, if we keep moving left, each step will make the snake's body longer by one but also remove it, so effectively the head moves without growing. Is that allowed?

Wait no: Because when you don't eat an apple, after inserting old head into body and then removing last element (the tail), which is the same as before movement.

So for initial step:

- S = [head]
- Move left once:
   - new_head = (4,5)
   - Insert old_head (5,5) to front → body becomes [(5,5)]
   - Since no apple eaten, remove last element → body is empty
   - So S after move: [new_head] i.e., head moves from (5,5) to (4,5)

Wait that's correct. So the snake effectively moves one cell left each time without growing.

But then if we do multiple LEFT moves:

Move 1:
- Head at (4,5)
- Body becomes empty
- Next move: move left again → new_head = (3,5)
- Insert old_head (4,5) into body → [(4,5)]
- Remove last element → body is empty
- S now is [new_head]

So each LEFT moves the head by one without growing.

But this can't be right because then after 6 such moves left from (5,5), we'd reach x=0 at (5 - 6 = negative). But wait movement in x-direction:

(5 →4→3→2→1→0. After that, moving LEFT again would go to (-1,5) which is a wall collision.

But according to rules, the head can't move outside grid bounds. So maximum possible left moves without hitting walls: from (5,5), we can only move two steps left: 5→4→3→2 but wait:

Wait no: From x=5, moving left once takes us to 4, then again to 3, and so on.

But each LEFT move is allowed as long as new_head doesn't go out of bounds. So from (5,5), moving left three times would take it to (2,5). Then four moves: (1,5); five moves: (0,5)—but that's the edge.

So if I make 3 LEFT moves:

Move 1: (4,5)
Move 2: (3,5)
Move 3: (2,5)

Now x=2. Next move would be to (1,5). After that, can we keep moving left?

At (0,5), next move left is (-1,5) which is invalid—so must stop.

Alternatively, maybe after some LEFT moves, switch direction and start moving UP towards the apple at (4,8).

But I need to plan a path where each step avoids self-collision. Since snake body remains empty unless it eats an apple, but in this case, we're not eating yet, so movement is straightforward.

So perhaps starting with 3 LEFT moves:

Move1: LEFT → (4,5)
Move2: LEFT → (3,5)
Move3: LEFT → (2,5)

Now from here, to reach x=4, I need to move right twice. But would that cause collision?

Wait after three LEFTs at (2,5), next moves could be:

Move4: RIGHT → (3,5). Is this safe? Current head is at (2,5); new_head = (3,5).

Check for collision with body segments—body is empty, so it's fine.

Update S:
- Insert old head (2,5) into body front
- Since not eating, remove last element (none to remove)
- So S becomes [new_head] → [(3,5)]

But wait that seems incorrect because the snake should be two segments: new_head and the previous position. Wait no.

Wait if initial state was moving from (2,5):

Old head is (2,5). After move RIGHT:

new_head = (3,5)
Insert old head into body → [(2,5)]
Since not eating apple, remove tail → body becomes empty
So S is [new_head] again?

This seems to suggest that after each non-apple-eating move, the snake's length remains 1. But that contradicts the example given where when a snake has a body, it grows.

Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding how movement works without eating apple. If you only have head and no body, moving would result in just the new_head because after inserting old_head into an empty body, then removing tail (which is same as before).

So effectively, each move would make S = [new_head]. So you can't grow unless you eat.

Thus to grow the snake, I need to find a way where after some moves, the snake's body list becomes non-empty. But that requires either being at a position where moving in such a way that inserting old_head into an empty body would result in multiple segments when eating apple is involved. Wait no—unless you have previous positions.

Wait unless the initial movement allows for growth? Maybe not. So to grow, I need to be able to insert older heads and then add them without immediately removing the tail.

But with only one segment (the head), after each move that's not an apple, it just becomes empty again.

Therefore, perhaps in this case, since the snake can't grow unless you eat apple, but we're trying to reach a position where x=4, y=8. So maybe I need to consider moving right eventually once I have some body segments.

Wait no: since without eating, the snake doesn't grow; so if I only move left and then right again, perhaps it's impossible because each move just moves head one cell without adding any new body parts except in the case of eating apple.

So maybe alternative approach is needed. Maybe start moving up first to increase y-coordinate towards 8.

Wait starting at (5,5), let me plan some steps:

1. Move UP → (5,6)
   - Check collision: no problem
   - Insert old_head into body front: [(5,5)]
   - Since not eating, remove tail: body becomes empty again

So now S = [new_head] = (5,6)

2. Next move: UP to (5,7)
   - Same as above; head moves up.

3. Next move: UP → (5,8). But the apple is at y=8, so moving up from 5 would reach it.

Wait wait no:

(5,5) → MOVE UP → (5,6), then (5,7), then (5,8).

So after three UP moves, head reaches (5,8). Now we need to move left twice to get to x=4.

But when moving LEFT from (5,8):

- After each LEFT:
   - Insert old_head into empty body → new S is [new_head]
   
This seems similar problem as before—snake can't grow unless it eats apple. So to move left and eventually reach x=4, I might need some way for the snake's body to have multiple segments so that moving in another direction would not just keep moving head.

Wait but since initial movement is only adding one cell each time without growing until an apple is eaten, maybe we can combine both x and y movements by strategically turning when body starts.

Alternatively, perhaps start with a combination of moves: some LEFT and UP to build up the body in such a way that eventually you have a path.

Wait but since the initial snake has no body, each move without eating just shifts head position. So maybe not possible unless we can make multiple moves towards target without collision.

But with limited options due to no body yet, perhaps only possibility is moving right or up until getting closer.

Alternatively, let me consider if I can find a path where after some number of moves, the snake has two segments, allowing movement in any direction without hitting walls.

Wait maybe try:

- Move LEFT twice: from (5,5) → 4→3
   - Each time moving left and body remains empty

Then move UP once: to (3,6). Now check for collision. Since it's the first UP after two LEFTs, no issue.

But now S would be [new_head] = (3,6)

Wait same problem as before—body is still empty unless you eat apple or have previous segments.

Alternatively, perhaps I need a different initial strategy where the snake moves in such a way that it starts growing early on to have multiple body parts and then navigate towards target without collision.

But since initially the body list is empty, seems difficult. Maybe alternative idea: maybe the snake can't reach (4,8) unless it makes 3 LEFTs and 3 UPs but with no growth until apple eaten—this would make head move along straight lines only.

Wait perhaps if I have to eat the apple at some point? But wait in this problem, do we need to eat the apple or can we just reach its position?

The original question is to get to (4,8), so if it's reachable without eating, then that would be better. Otherwise, maybe you have to.

Wait let me re-read rules: "your task is to determine a sequence of moves for the snake to move from given starting point to given target."

So whether or not an apple is present affects movement possibilities—since moving towards apple allows growing and changing direction more freely.

But in this problem's body, the initial state has no apple. So perhaps need to see if (4,8) can be reached without eating? Or maybe you have to eat it at some point.

If we don't eat, then as per movement rules, each move only changes head position and the snake remains length 1 unless it eats an apple which is required for turning or avoiding walls.

Wait but this seems problematic because if I'm moving straight towards (4,8) with head moving left once, then up thrice without growing—this would take time:

From (5,5):

- Move LEFT → 4,5
   - S = [4,5]
Then move UP to 4,6; 4,7; 4,8.

But is that possible? Let me simulate step-by-step.

Move1: LEFT → (4,5)
   - Insert old_head (5,5) into empty body → body becomes [(5,5)]
   - Since not eating, remove tail → body becomes empty
   So S = [new_head] = [4,5]

Wait no—earlier thought process said when you don't eat apple and have initial snake of head only:

After move1: new_head (4,5) is added to front of empty body. Then since not eating, tail removed; so body becomes [(4,5)], but then step3b says if not eating, remove last element → back to empty.

Wait no—that can't be—because after inserting old_head into an empty body list and removing the only element (as in [old_head]), you end up with empty again. So S = []? No that's impossible because snake must have at least head as per definition.

I think I've made a mistake here—let me clarify:

When the snake is represented as S, it includes its current body segments from the head to tail.

If we start with [head] and no body cells (since body list is empty), then moving involves inserting old_head into front of empty body → new body becomes [old_head]. Then if not eating, remove last element → body becomes empty again. Hence S after move would be []? But that's incorrect because the snake must have at least head.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding step 3b:

"if new_head == apple position, do not remove tail this turn."

Else: "remove last element of body"

But when you don't eat and your current body is empty except for inserting old_head (which becomes the new body), then removing the only element would leave it as empty.

So after that move, S = [new_head], which implies the snake's head has moved but there are no segments behind. Hence effectively, the snake can just move without growing.

But in reality, a snake must have at least one segment (head) to exist. So I think the process is:

When you insert old_head into front of body and then remove last element, it results in a new S that includes only [new_head].

Hence each non-apple-eating move shifts head position but doesn't add any body segments.

This seems inconsistent with typical snake movement where without eating, you don't grow. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules.

Wait let me check:

"3a. Insert old head into front of the BODY list

   3b(i) if not eating: remove tail from new body"

So when you move and do not eat apple, after inserting old head, you have to remove last element (tail). So S becomes [new_head].

Hence each non-apple-eating move shifts head one cell and doesn't add any body parts.

Thus the snake can only grow if it eats an apple.

Therefore, to reach a target position with length 1, just keep moving in that direction. But without growing, movement is limited because you don't have multiple segments to change directions or avoid walls.

Hence perhaps (4,8) requires eating the apple at some point—since otherwise, snake can only move head around but cannot maneuver effectively.

Wait maybe so: if we need to reach (4,8), and without being able to turn unless the snake has body parts. So probably have to eat the apple somewhere in between to allow for changing direction.

But given that the initial position is (5,5) with no apple—this complicates things because you might not be able to directly reach (4,8) unless there's an apple to trigger growth.

Wait but perhaps movement isn't blocked by walls if the snake can grow into them. So maybe we don't need to worry about that in this case since target is within bounds.

But wait, from starting point at (5,5), moving up thrice would take it to y=8 in three moves—provided no wall blocks and no apple eaten yet.

So:

1. Move UP → (5,6)
2. Move UP → (5,7)
3. Move UP → (5,8)

But then from here, can we move LEFT twice?

At each step after moving UP thrice without eating, the snake is just head moving up but no body segments.

Hence:

1. From (5,6): move left → would make new_head =4,6
   - Insert old_head into empty body; then remove tail—so S becomes [new_head] again

2. Then from 4,6: move LEFT to 3,6—but same issue.

But this is problematic because the snake doesn't have any body segments so can’t change direction without eating an apple which would require adding body parts.

Therefore seems that unless you eat the apple at some point, you cannot maneuver in such a way as to change direction. But if we need to reach (4,8), perhaps it's better to try moving towards it straight and then see where problems arise.

Alternatively, maybe I can make some alternative moves:

From starting position (5,5):

- Move LEFT twice: 4→3; so after two moves at y=5

Then move UP thrice:

From 3,5 → move up once to 3,6
Move up again to 3,7
Move up third time to 3,8

Now from (3,8), need to get back to x=4.

So now S is [3,8]

1. Move RIGHT once: to 4,8—success!

But let's verify each step:

Starting at (5,5):

Move LEFT → (4,5)
   - S becomes [4,5]
Move LEFT again → (3,5)
   - S becomes [3,5]
Then move UP thrice.

First UP: 3→4; y=6
S after inserting old_head and removing tail: [3,6]

Second UP: to 3,7

Third UP: to 3,8

Now at (3,8). Next move:

RIGHT → (4,8)

Since in this step, the snake is only one segment. So check for apple—apple is not present? Wait no—the problem says we have an apple placed somewhere on a grid.

Wait wait I think I misread: the original question mentions that there's an apple to be eaten—if you can eat it without collision or wall issues.

But in this case, perhaps since (4,8) is where the apple is located—so if moving directly towards it would involve eating it when head reaches y=8?

Wait no—the apple needs to be on a cell for the snake to reach. So maybe from 3,8, moving right once gets us to 4,8 which is apple.

But wait, how do we get there without collision? At each step:

From (5,5) → move LEFT twice: positions are now [3,5]

Then three UPs lead to [3,6], [3,7], [3,8].

So when at 3,8, moving RIGHT would be to 4,8.

But wait is that cell free? Let me check:

After each step, the body of snake is only head, so no collision with previous positions. So from (5,5) after three UPs: [3,6], then [3,7], then [3,8]. Then moving RIGHT to 4,8.

But at that point, does any part of the snake's body block? The snake is only occupying one cell in each step except when it has multiple segments. Since all movements so far have kept S as single cells until now—so no collision.

Thus seems possible: move LEFT twice and UP thrice to reach (3,8), then RIGHT once to 4,8.

But wait initial position's body is empty; moving LEFT adds the head but without growing because apple not eaten. Then after reaching at x=3,y=8 with one segment again—then moving RIGHT would have same problem: no growth unless eat apple.

Wait but if from (3,8) we move RIGHT to 4,8 which is apple's location—we can just do it?

But the rules say:

- If during movement you are about to enter a cell that contains an apple and new_head equals apple position—then you must eat it without collision or wrap-around.

Hence when moving into (4,8), if there's an apple, then you can move.

So in this case, since 4,8 is the target and presumably has an apple on it—so after reaching y=8 at x=3,y=8; moving right to 4,8 would be eating the apple. So that movement is allowed as per rule.

Hence seems possible: from (5,5):

Move LEFT twice → [3,5]

Move UP thrice → reaches [3,8]

Then move RIGHT once → 4,8

Thus total moves:

Left x2, Up x3, Right x1 = 6 moves.

But wait the problem is whether when moving up from (3,5) to (3,6), does that cause any collision?

Because during this movement, each step only shifts head position without growing. So no segments are in between—so no collision issues.

Similarly for other steps: same logic applies.

Hence possible sequence would be:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. UP
4. UP
5. UP
6. RIGHT

Thus achieving the goal at (4,8) with 6 moves.

Alternatively, another possible path could involve a different combination of lefts and ups before moving right.

But seems that six moves is feasible.
</think>

To reach from position (5,5) to (4,8), the snake can move LEFT twice, then UP thrice, followed by RIGHT once. This sequence results in:

1. Move LEFT
2. Move LEFT
3. Move UP
4. Move UP
5. Move UP
6. Move RIGHT

This path allows the snake to reach (4,8) without colliding with itself or walls.

$\boxed{\text{LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP, UP, RIGHT}}$
