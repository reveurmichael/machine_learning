========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,2) facing UP. The apple is at (2,3). The first move must not reverse direction (cannot go DOWN), so RIGHT is safe to move towards the apple's x-coordinate. The next move UP brings the head to (1,3), still moving towards the apple while avoiding the body."
}
``` 

Wait, let me re-examine the body positions to ensure the path is safe.

Current head: (0,2), direction: UP.
Body: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)].

First move: RIGHT.
New head: (0+1, 2) = (1,2).
Check collision: (1,2) is not in the body list (body is at y=1), so safe.
After move: body becomes [(0,2), (0,1), (1,1), ...] (old head inserted at front, tail not removed since not eating apple).

Now head is at (1,2), direction is RIGHT (since we just moved RIGHT).
Apple is at (2,3).

Next move: UP.
New head: (1, 2+1) = (1,3).
Check collision: (1,3) is not in the body list (body is now [(0,2), (0,1), (1,1), ...], so safe.
After move: body becomes [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1), ...].

Now head is at (1,3), direction is UP.
Apple is at (2,3).

Next move would be RIGHT to (2,3), but we only have 2 moves in the output. So the path is incomplete, but the first two moves are safe.

Wait, the apple is at (2,3), and after two moves (RIGHT, UP), the head is at (1,3), which is one step left and one step up from start, but not yet at apple. So the path is incomplete.

Alternative path: RIGHT, RIGHT, UP.

First move: RIGHT to (1,2).
Second move: RIGHT to (2,2).
Third move: UP to (2,3).

Check collisions:
After first move: body is [(0,2), (0,1), ...], (1,2) is safe.
After second move: body is [(1,2), (0,2), ...], (2,2) is safe (body is at y=1).
After third move: body is [(2,2), (1,2), ...], (2,3) is safe (apple position).

This path is safe and reaches the apple in 3 moves.

But the initial reasoning was incomplete. Let's adjust the output.

Final answer:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,2) facing UP. The apple is at (2,3). Moving RIGHT twice brings the head to (2,2), then moving UP reaches the apple at (2,3). This path avoids the body and stays within bounds."
}
``` 

Wait, but the initial direction is UP, and the first move is RIGHT (not reversing), which is allowed. The body is at y=1, so (1,2) and (2,2) are safe.

Thus, the correct output is:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,2) facing UP. Moving RIGHT twice avoids the body at y=1 and positions the head at (2,2), then moving UP reaches the apple at (2,3). This path is safe and avoids collisions."
}
``` 

Final JSON:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,2) facing UP. Moving RIGHT twice avoids the body at y=1 and positions the head at (2,2), then moving UP reaches the apple at (2,3). This path is safe and avoids collisions."
}
