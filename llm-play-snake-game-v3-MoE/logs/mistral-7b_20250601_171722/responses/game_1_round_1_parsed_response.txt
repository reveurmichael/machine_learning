```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "We move 'UP' to increase y (direction 1), then 'RIGHT' three times to approach the apple, since our head is currently at (5,5) and the apple is at (8,4). This path ensures we avoid colliding with walls or our body segments while staying within bounds. After eating the apple, there will be a legal move next turn."
