<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with itself or going outside the grid. Let's start by understanding the initial setup.

The head is at (5,5), and the body cells are empty except for the head, which means the snake is just the head right now. The apple is at (6,5). So, initially, the snake can move to the right towards the apple. But I have to make sure it doesn't reverse direction in the first move since the current direction is "NONE", so any direction is allowed.

First thought: moving right would take the head to (6,5), which is where the apple is. That seems straightforward. But I need to check if that's a valid move and won't cause any immediate collisions.

So, step by step:

1. The initial body is just [(5,5)] since it's only the head.
2. Direction is "NONE", so possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
3. Moving right would make the new head (6,5), which is exactly where the apple is.

Now, check for collisions:
- New head is within grid bounds? Yes, 6 and 5 are both between 0 and 9.
- Does new head collide with any body cells? The only body cell is (5,5), which is the current head. Since we're moving, it's allowed.

Next step: after eating the apple, the body should grow. So, the body will now include the old head as the first segment and add the new head.

Wait, but according to the movement rules, when the snake eats the apple, the body grows by 1 without removing the tail. So the new body would be [(5,5), (6,5)].

But I also need to ensure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move next turn to avoid trapping. If the snake is now of length 2, with head at (6,5) and body at (5,5), the possible directions would be left or right again. Since moving back might cause a collision, but moving right isn't possible because that's where the apple is. Wait, no—the next move can go in any direction except reversing the current direction unless it's the first move.

Wait, after eating the apple, the snake's head is at (6,5), and the body is [(5,5), (6,5)]. The next move cannot reverse the direction of movement. Since the last move was right, the next move can be up, down, or left, but not right again immediately.

So from (6,5), possible moves are UP to (6,6), DOWN to (6,4), or LEFT back to (5,5). But moving LEFT would take the head to (5,5), which is a body cell. So that's invalid because you can't move into your own body except when it's the tail's position after movement.

Wait, no—the body cells are [(5,5), (6,5)]. The new head would be at (5,5) if moving left. But (5,5) is a body cell that isn't the tail's current position because the tail is still at (6,5). So moving into (5,5) would cause a collision with the body, so that's not allowed.

So after eating the apple, possible moves are UP or DOWN. Let's say we choose UP to (6,6). Then the new head is there, and the body becomes [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. The next move can be any direction except reversing again. So directions allowed would be RIGHT, LEFT, or UP again (since last was UP).

Wait, but from (6,6), if we go RIGHT to (7,6), is that a valid path? Let's see:

- New head at (7,6): within grid.
- Check body cells: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6)]—so no collision.

After that, the body would grow or move normally. Since we didn't eat the apple this time, just moved to a new position.

But in our initial case, the snake can reach the apple in one move without issues. So why complicate things?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a longer path where the snake moves up first, then right, but that seems unnecessary since moving directly right is possible.

Wait, but let me re-examine the movement rules:

- After eating, ensure at least one legal move next turn to avoid trapping.

In our case, after eating, the head is at (6,5), body is [(5,5), (6,5)]. The next move can't be right again immediately because that's reversing direction from right to right. Wait, no—the current direction was NONE, so moving right is allowed as it's not a reverse.

Wait, no: the movement rules say:

2. **Cannot reverse**: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed.

So after eating the apple, the snake's direction becomes whatever it was before—since last move was right. Wait, no—the initial direction was NONE, then moving right sets the direction to RIGHT.

Wait, in the initial state, the direction is NONE, so when you choose a direction, that becomes the new current direction. So after moving right, the current direction is RIGHT.

So next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse from RIGHT to LEFT.

Therefore, from (6,5), with direction RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.

Possible moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. But moving RIGHT again would take it to (7,5), which may not have any issues unless the body is in the way.

But let's think about this:

If we choose to move right again from (6,5) to (7,5):

- Check if new head (7,5) is within grid: yes.
- Does it collide with body cells? Body cells are [(5,5), (6,5)]. So no collision.

Then, the body would update by inserting the old head (6,5) at the front, making body [(6,5), (5,5), (6,5)] and then removing the tail since it didn't eat the apple. Wait, but if the snake is moving right again, it's not eating the apple again because it's just moving.

Wait no—the apple is eaten once when the head moves into it. So after that, the body grows, and subsequent moves don't affect the apple anymore.

So in this case, moving right again would be fine, but perhaps not necessary since we've already reached the apple.

But according to the problem statement, the snake needs to eat the apple by having its head move into it. So once the head is there, that's sufficient.

Therefore, the simplest path is to just move right once from (5,5) to (6,5).

Is there any reason this wouldn't work? Let's check:

- Initial body: [(5,5)].
- Moving right: new head (6,5).
- Check collision: no, because body is only at (5,5), which is the head.
- Update body: insert old head at front ⇒ [(5,5)], then since it ate the apple, grow by adding the new head as BODY1. So body becomes [(5,5), (6,5)].

Then, next move can't be left immediately because direction was right. But we've achieved our goal.

So why not just return ["RIGHT"] as the moves?

But wait, let me make sure there's no other condition I'm missing. For example, after eating, ensure that there's at least one legal move. In this case, from (6,5), with direction right, possible moves are up, down, or right again.

So yes, there are multiple options, but the initial move is valid.

Therefore, the optimal path is to move right once.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Move directly towards the apple at (6,5) from the head's position at (5,5). This is a straightforward path that avoids collisions and satisfies all movement rules."
}
```
```

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (6, 5).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
