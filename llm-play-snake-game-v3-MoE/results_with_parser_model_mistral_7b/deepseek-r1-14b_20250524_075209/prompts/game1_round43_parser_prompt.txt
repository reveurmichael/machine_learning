You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

Alright, let's break down how to solve this problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the current state of the game. The snake's head is at (1,9), which is the top-left area of the grid since coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left. The current direction is "UP," but wait, the head is already at y=9, so moving up would take it out of bounds. That can't be right. Wait, no—the snake's body cells are [(1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)], which means the body extends to the right from (1,8) in the same row as the head. The apple is at (0,9), directly to the left of the head.

The goal is to move the snake so that the head reaches (0,9). Let's calculate the movement needed: from x=1 to x=0, which requires moving left once. Since y remains 9, we don't need any up or down movements.

But wait, the current direction is "UP," and we can't reverse. Reversing would mean changing direction from UP to DOWN, which isn't allowed. So, from "UP," possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or remain NONE? No, current direction is UP, so next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, but not DOWN.

So the plan is to move LEFT once to reach the apple at (0,9). Let's check for collisions:

- The new head would be (1-1, 9) = (0,9), which is exactly where the apple is. So this move is valid as it will eat the apple.
- Check if any body segments are in the way except the tail. The body cells are [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]. None of these have y=9, so moving to (0,9) is safe.

After eating the apple, the snake's body grows by one segment. So the new body will include the old head at (1,9) inserted before the existing body cells. The tail won't be removed this turn, increasing the length.

Next, I need to ensure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move next turn to avoid trapping. After moving LEFT, the head is at (0,9). The possible directions now would depend on the new direction rules. Since the last move was LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

Looking ahead: from (0,9), possible moves are DOWN or UP? Wait, no—after moving LEFT to (0,9), the current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT. So available directions are UP, DOWN, or NONE? Or wait, after moving in a certain direction, you can't reverse immediately.

Wait, in movement rules, if current direction is "UP," you may not choose "DOWN" next. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. But since the first move is from UP to LEFT, the new direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT. So from (0,9), possible moves are UP or DOWN.

But let's think about the grid boundaries: at (0,9), moving LEFT would go out of bounds, but that's not an option because the movement was already to the apple. After eating, the snake is longer, so I need to make sure it doesn't get stuck.

In this case, after eating, the next move can be DOWN or UP. For example, moving DOWN from (0,9) would take it to (0,8), which is a body segment's position. Wait, because the body cells are [(1,8), (2,8), etc.]. So (0,8) isn't occupied yet.

Wait, after eating the apple, the body becomes [HEAD (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]. The tail is still at (5,8). So moving DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8) would be safe because it's not occupied by any body segments except possibly the tail. Wait, no—the tail is at (5,8), so (0,8) is clear.

Therefore, after eating, there are valid moves, so the path is safe.
</think>

The snake needs to move LEFT once to reach the apple without causing collisions. Moving in this direction from UP is allowed and leads directly to the apple's position.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Move left to reach the apple at (0,9) safely."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (1, 9) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)], to eat the apple at (0, 9).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
