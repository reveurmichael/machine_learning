You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm controlling a snake in a 10x10 grid, starting at (0,9) and trying to reach the apple at (1,9). The current direction is "UP", and the body of the snake consists of segments ordered from the head down to the tail.

First, I need to understand the movement rules properly. The snake can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Each move involves the head moving in the current direction, followed by the rest of the body adjusting accordingly. However, if the new head position is outside the grid or collides with any part of its own body (except possibly the tail's previous position), the snake dies.

Given that the head starts at (0,9) and the apple is at (1,9), I notice that moving RIGHT would bring the head directly to the apple. However, I need to ensure that this move doesn't cause a collision with any of the body segments. The current body cells are [(0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7)]. 

So, if I choose RIGHT, the new head position would be (1,9). Checking for collisions: is this position occupied by any part of the body? Looking at the body segments, the tail is at (3,7), and none of the other segments are near (1,9), so moving here should be safe.

But wait, I also need to consider that after eating the apple, the snake grows without losing a segment. However, in this case, since the head is already next to the apple, I don't have to worry about growth because the movement results in the head reaching the apple immediately.

Another thing to check is whether moving RIGHT is allowed based on the direction rules. The current direction is UP, so moving LEFT would be reversing direction and is not allowed. Moving DOWN or RIGHT are valid choices.

So, considering all this, the optimal move is to go RIGHT from (0,9) to (1,9), eat the apple, and that's the end of the path. This should satisfy all movement rules and prevent any collisions.
</think>

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving RIGHT will take the head from (0,9) to (1,9) to eat the apple, ensuring no collision with the body segments and following all movement rules."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 9) and whose body cells are in list format [(3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8)], to eat the apple at (1, 9).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
