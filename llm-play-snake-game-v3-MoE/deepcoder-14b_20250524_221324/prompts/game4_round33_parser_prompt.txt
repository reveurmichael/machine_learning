<think>
Alright, I need to figure out how to help the snake reach the apple at (8,9) without colliding with itself or the walls. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the current state of the snake: the head is at (5,5), and its body extends behind it in the direction it's moving. The body cells are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], which suggests that the snake is currently facing to the LEFT because each subsequent body part decreases the x-coordinate by 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the head is at (5,5). The first body cell is (5,4), which is directly below the head—so if the head's current direction is "UP", then that would mean the body is moving upwards. Wait no, wait: the current direction is given as "NONE". Oh, right! So the current direction is NONE, meaning the snake isn't moving in any particular direction. But looking at the body cells, they are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], which suggests that from the head, the next part is down (since y decreases by 1). Wait no: wait, the coordinate system has (0,0) as bottom-left and (9,9) as top-right. So moving up increases y, right? So if the head is at (5,5), then (5,4) would be below it (down), but that's only possible if the snake is moving DOWN.

Wait no: Wait, the body cells are ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the head is at (5,5), and the next body part is (5,4), then the direction must be DOWN because y decreases by 1. But wait, the current direction is given as "NONE". That seems conflicting.

Wait no: The current direction in the input is "UP". Wait, no! Let me check again. Oh no, the user provided that the current direction is "UP" for one of their examples, but in this specific problem, I think the head's position is (5,5), body cells are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], and the direction is NONE.

Wait no: Wait, looking back at the input:

The user says:

• Head position: `(5,5)` — (x,y) of the snake's head.  
• Current direction: `"UP"` — One of "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "NONE".  

So yes, current direction is UP.

Wait no! Wait, no—no, in the problem statement, under "Inputs:", it says:

• Head position: `(5,5)`  
• Current direction: `"UP"` — so the snake is currently moving upwards. So that explains why the body cells are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]: each step behind the head moves left by 1 in x-coordinate because the direction is UP, but wait—if the current direction is UP, then from the head at (5,5), moving up would increase y. But the body cells are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], which suggests that they are below the head (since their y is 4). That seems odd.

Wait no—maybe I'm misunderstanding the direction of the body segments. The body cells list is ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the snake's current direction is UP, then the next segment would be in front of the head when moving up. Wait, no: the body follows the head, so when moving up (head at (5,5), next step would be (5,6) assuming it moves up.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

When the snake is moving UP, each new head position is (x, y+1). So from (5,5), if it's moving UP, the body segments would follow in that direction.

But according to the input, the body cells are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], which suggests that after the head at (5,5), the next part is (5,4)—which is below the head. That can't be right if the snake is moving UP. Wait, no: perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body cells are ordered.

Wait, no: The body cells list starts with the segment immediately behind the head. So when the snake is moving UP, the next segment (behind the head) would be at (5,4), then (5,3), etc., but that doesn't align with the given body cells [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], which suggests that each subsequent segment decreases in x by 1. That implies that the snake is moving to the LEFT.

Wait, this is conflicting because the current direction is UP, but the body seems to be extending to the left. How can that be? Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body cells are ordered.

Ah! Wait: The body cells list starts with the segment immediately behind the head and proceeds towards the tail. So if the snake is moving in a certain direction, each subsequent body cell should follow that path.

Wait no—if the current direction is UP, then the next body part after the head would be at (5,6), not (5,4). Wait, but the given body cells are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], which suggests that from (5,5), the snake's body is moving down and left. That doesn't align with a current direction of UP.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the current direction. Let me check the input again:

In the problem statement, under "Inputs:", it says:

• Current direction: `"UP"` — One of "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "NONE".

So yes, the snake's current direction is UP.

But then why are the body cells [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]? That would mean that from (5,5), the next part is at (5,4)—which is directly below, which would be DOWN. Then the next part is (4,4), which is to the left of (5,4). So this suggests that the snake's body is moving down and then left.

But if the current direction is UP, how can the body be moving down? That seems contradictory. Unless perhaps I'm misunderstanding something about the movement rules.

Wait no: Wait, maybe the snake's body follows in the same path as the head, but when it turns, the body cells adjust accordingly. But the current direction is UP, so the head is moving up, and the body parts are following behind.

But according to the given body cells, after (5,5), the next part is at (5,4)—which is down, which would be the opposite direction of UP. That suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding or perhaps the current direction isn't UP but something else.

Wait no: Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the body cells. The body cells list starts with the segment immediately behind the head and goes towards the tail. So if the snake is moving UP (head at (5,5)), then the next part would be (5,6), not (5,4). But in this case, the next part is (5,4), which is below—so perhaps the current direction was DOWN, but that's conflicting with the input.

Wait no: Let me double-check. The head is at (5,5), and the body cells are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]. So from (5,5) to (5,4) would be down (y decreases by 1). Then from (5,4) to (4,4) would be left (x decreases by 1). Then from (4,4) to (3,4) is also left. This suggests that the snake's body is moving in a "down then left" direction, but this doesn't align with the current direction being UP.

Wait a minute—maybe I'm misunderstanding how the current direction affects the body cells. The current direction indicates the direction the head is facing and where it will move next. So if the current direction is UP, the next head position would be (5,6). But in this case, the body cells suggest that after (5,5), the next part is (5,4)—which implies that the snake was previously moving down.

But according to the input, the current direction is UP. So perhaps there's a mistake here, or maybe I'm missing something about how the body cells are ordered.

Wait no—no, perhaps the snake's movement can change directions, but the body cells list represents the current state of the body segments after the head. If the snake was previously moving down and then turned up, the body would reflect that path.

But regardless of that, I need to plan a path for the snake to reach (8,9) from its current position at (5,5). The apple is at (8,9), which is to the northeast of the head. So the snake needs to move right and up.

Given that the current direction is UP, but the body cells suggest that the body is extending downward and then leftward, perhaps I need to adjust the direction accordingly.

Wait no: Wait, perhaps the current direction being UP means that the next movement will be upwards (increasing y). So from (5,5), moving up would take the head to (5,6).

But given that the body is [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], which suggests that the snake's body is extending downward and then leftward, perhaps the snake was previously moving down and then turned left, but now the current direction is UP.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the problem at hand: planning a path from (5,5) to (8,9).

The apple is located at (x=8,y=9), which is 3 units to the right and 4 units up from the head's current position.

So the snake needs to move east (right) and north (up). However, given that the current direction is UP, perhaps it can start moving right after making a turn.

Wait no: Wait, the current direction is UP, but if the snake wants to change direction, it has to make sure it doesn't reverse directions in a way that would cause its body to collide with itself. So the movement must be planned carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the current direction being UP allows the snake to move up first and then turn right or something like that.

But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to have the snake move directly towards the apple by moving east (right) and north (up). Since the apple is to the northeast, the snake can make a series of moves: right, right, right, up, up, up, up.

Wait, but considering the body's current position, perhaps some of these movements could cause collision with the body. So I need to ensure that each new head position doesn't collide with any part of the body.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can move in a way that extends its body towards the apple without overlapping itself.

But perhaps there's a more efficient path. Let me think about the minimal number of steps required.

The distance is 3 right and 4 up, so total movement would be 7 steps if moving directly (right x3, then up x4). Alternatively, some combination of rights and ups in any order.

However, considering that the snake's body is currently extending downward and leftward from its head, perhaps it's better to first move right a few times to get away from the current body and then start moving up.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline possible steps:

Current position: Head at (5,5), body cells [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)].

The snake's direction is UP, which means that the next move would be towards (5,6). But if it moves up, then the body cells will shift accordingly.

Wait no: Wait, when a snake moves forward, each segment follows the one in front of it. So if the head moves to (5,6), the previous head (5,5) becomes the next body part, and so on. So the new body cells would be [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4)].

But perhaps this isn't essential for planning the path; I just need to ensure that each new position of the head doesn't collide with any existing body segments.

So starting at (5,5), the snake can move right (east) or up (north). Since the apple is at (8,9), which requires moving east 3 times and north 4 times, perhaps a direct path would be best.

But considering the current body position, if the snake moves right first, it might avoid collision. Let's try:

1. Move right to (6,5). Check for collisions: The new head is at (6,5). The body cells are now [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]. Wait no: After moving, the body would shift: the previous head (5,5) becomes part of the body, and the old body segments move forward.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more accurately. Let me consider how the snake's body moves:

- When the snake moves in a direction, each segment follows the one in front of it.

So initial state:

Head: (5,5)

Body segments: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]

If the snake moves right (east) from (5,5), the new head is at (6,5). The body segments would then be [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]—wait no: No, wait. When the head moves, each segment follows the previous one.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

- Original order: Head at H=(5,5); body cells B1=(5,4), B2=(4,4), B3=(3,4).

When the snake moves right (east) from H to (6,5):

New head is at (6,5). The previous head (5,5) becomes the new B1, and each subsequent body part shifts:

So new body cells would be [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4)], but wait: no. Wait, when the snake moves forward, each segment takes the position of the segment in front of it.

Wait no—snake movement works such that each part follows the one in front, so:

When head moves to (6,5):

- The new body segments would be:

B1: (5,5) [old head]

B2: (5,4)

B3: (4,4)

But wait, no—this can't be right because B1 was at (5,4), which is below the old head.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as:

- Original positions:

H=(5,5)

B1=(5,4) [behind H]

B2=(4,4)

B3=(3,4)

If H moves right to (6,5), then B1 would move to where H was: (5,5). Then B2 would move to where B1 was: (5,4). And B3 would move to where B2 was: (4,4).

Wait no: Wait, that's not correct. When the snake moves forward, each segment follows the path of the segment in front of it.

So when H moves from (5,5) to (6,5), B1 (which is at (5,4)) can't directly follow because it's not adjacent in the direction of movement.

Wait no—this isn't possible. The body segments are connected end-to-end, so if the head moves right, each segment must also move right in a way that maintains the snake's continuity.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to model it step by step:

- Original positions:

H=(5,5)

B1=(5,4)

B2=(4,4)

B3=(3,4)

If H moves right (east) from (5,5) to (6,5), then the new body segments would be:

New B0: H=(6,5)

Old H=(5,5) becomes B1.

But wait, no—snake movement requires that each segment follows the one in front. So when H moves right, B1 must move into H's old position if it's directly behind along the same path.

Wait no: Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body segments follow. The snake is a continuous line of body parts; each part can only occupy positions that are adjacent to the previous one in the direction of movement.

But in this case, the head is at (5,5), and B1 is at (5,4)—which is below it. So if the head moves right (east) to (6,5), then B1 cannot follow directly because it's not adjacent in that direction; instead, the body would have a gap.

Wait no—that can't happen. The snake must move as a continuous line. Therefore, if the head moves right from (5,5) to (6,5), the next segment (B1) must be at (5,5) to maintain continuity.

But that's not possible because B1 was previously at (5,4). So perhaps moving east directly isn't possible unless the snake is in a straight line and can move in that direction without causing any of its body segments to overlap or leave gaps.

Wait, this suggests that the snake cannot change direction abruptly. It can only move in directions where each segment can follow the one in front without leaving gaps.

In this case, since B1 is at (5,4), which is directly below H=(5,5), if H moves right to (6,5), then B1 must be able to reach (5,5) from its current position. But (5,4) to (5,5) is possible by moving up one step. However, the snake's movement is such that each segment can only move in the direction dictated by the head's movement.

Wait no: The snake moves as a single unit; all body segments follow the path set by the head's movements. So if the head moves right, each body segment must also shift accordingly to maintain the snake's integrity.

But given the current configuration of body segments, moving right from H=(5,5) might not be possible without causing the body to break or overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can move up first to (5,6), then start moving right. Let me see:

1. Move up from (5,5) to (5,6). Now, the body would adjust as follows:

- New H=(5,6)

- Old H=(5,5) becomes B1.

- B1 was at (5,4) moves to (5,5).

Wait no: Wait, when the head moves up to (5,6), each segment must follow. So:

Original positions:

H=(5,5)

B1=(5,4)

B2=(4,4)

B3=(3,4)

After moving H to (5,6):

New H=(5,6)

Old B1=(5,4) can't directly move up to (5,5) because it's two steps away. Wait no—each movement step moves only one unit, so if H moves up by one, the body segments must also adjust accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about how the body segments follow. Each time the head moves, all body segments move one step in the same direction as the head. So:

If H moves up to (5,6), then B1=(5,4) would move up to (5,5), B2=(4,4) would move up to (4,5), and B3=(3,4) would move up to (3,5).

Wait no—that doesn't make sense because the body segments should follow the path of the head.

Wait, perhaps each segment moves into the position vacated by the segment in front. So:

When H moves from (5,5) to (5,6), B1=(5,4) must move towards where H was, but that's not directly possible because it's two steps down.

Wait no—this suggests that the snake can't move up if its body is in a different direction. Maybe I'm overcomplicating; perhaps the snake can only move in certain directions without causing itself to collide or break apart.

Given this confusion, maybe it's better to plan a path where the snake moves right first to (6,5), then proceeds east and north accordingly, ensuring that each new position doesn't overlap with any body segments.

Alternatively, perhaps moving up first is better. Let me try:

1. Move up from (5,5) to (5,6). Now, the body would adjust as follows:

- New H=(5,6)

- B1 moves from (5,4) to (5,5)

Wait no—this can't happen because moving up one step from H=(5,5) would require that B1 is at (5,4), which is directly below. So when H moves up, B1 would be at (5,5), which was the old H position.

But then B2 would move to where B1 was: (5,4). Wait no—this isn't possible because B2 was at (4,4), which is a different x-coordinate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to consider that when the head moves in any direction, each body segment follows the path by moving into the position of the previous segment. So:

- If H moves right from (5,5) to (6,5), then B1 must move from (5,4) to where H was: (5,5). But that's not possible because (5,4) is below (5,5); moving up would be required for B1 to reach (5,5).

But since the movement is simultaneous for all segments, perhaps this isn't allowed. Therefore, the snake can only move in directions where all body segments are aligned and can follow without overlapping or leaving gaps.

Given that, perhaps the snake cannot move east (right) directly from its current position because B1 is below H. So it might need to first adjust its body by moving up or down before moving right.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem expects a simple path without considering the body's movement constraints, focusing only on the head's path towards the apple.

If that's the case, then the minimal steps would be:

East x3, North x4: 7 moves in total, any order combining rights and ups as long as they sum to 3 east and 4 north.

But perhaps a more efficient way is needed. Alternatively, maybe the snake can move diagonally if possible, but I think each movement is either horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.

So, the path could be:

East, East, East, North, North, North, North.

Or any interleaving of easts and norths as long as all are done.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves would be 7: 3 rights and 4 ups in any order.

But perhaps I should outline a specific path. Let's say:

1. Right to (6,5)

2. Right to (7,5)

3. Right to (8,5) – now at x=8 but y=5; need to go up 4 more units.

Wait no, that would require moving east three times and then north four times, totaling 7 moves.

Alternatively:

1. Up to (5,6)

2. Up to (5,7)

3. Up to (5,8)

4. Up to (5,9) – now at y=9 but x=5; need to move east three units.

Then right three times: (6,9), (7,9), (8,9). That's 4 up moves and 3 right moves, totaling 7 steps as well.

Either way, it's seven steps. But perhaps there's a shorter path if the snake can move in a way that reduces the total number of steps by combining movements more efficiently. However, since each step is one unit either east or north, I don't think you can get fewer than 7 moves (3+4).

Therefore, the minimal number of moves required for the snake to reach the apple at (8,9) from its starting position is 7.
</think>

The snake needs to make a total of seven moves: three steps east (right) and four steps north (up). The exact order can vary, but the sum must be three rights and four ups. Here's one possible path:

1. Right
2. Right
3. Right
4. Up
5. Up
6. Up
7. Up

So, the snake moves east three times to reach column 8, then north four times to reach row 9.

**Answer:** The snake must make a total of seven moves: \boxed{7}.
