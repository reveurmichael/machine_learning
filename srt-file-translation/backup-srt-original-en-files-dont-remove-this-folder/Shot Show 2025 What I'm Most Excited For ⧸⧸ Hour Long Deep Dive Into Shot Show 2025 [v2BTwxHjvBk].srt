differently based on the match that I'm
doing based on the distances that I'm

1104
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:56,919
doing based on the distances that I'm
 

1105
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:58,630
doing based on the distances that I'm
using really some of the matches like

1106
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
using really some of the matches like
 

1107
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,630
using really some of the matches like
out west if I'm shoot a match in Texas

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
like we were some of the first to
 

1241
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,630
like we were some of the first to
Pioneer the the dmls process which is

1242
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:21,640
Pioneer the the dmls process which is
 

1243
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,870
Pioneer the the dmls process which is
essentially like a fancy way to 3D print

1244
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:23,880
essentially like a fancy way to 3D print
 

1245
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,190
essentially like a fancy way to 3D print
but it's printing uh with metal so

1246
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,200
but it's printing uh with metal so
 

1247
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,470
but it's printing uh with metal so
titanium and in canel are the two

1248
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:27,480
titanium and in canel are the two
 

1249
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,230
titanium and in canel are the two
materials that we use

1250
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,240
materials that we use
 

1251
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,190
materials that we use
um and really what that printing allows

1252
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,200
um and really what that printing allows
 

1253
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,310
um and really what that printing allows
us to do is have kind of crazy

1254
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
us to do is have kind of crazy
 

1255
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,909
us to do is have kind of crazy
geometries on the inside so uh in the

1256
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:36,919
geometries on the inside so uh in the
 

1257
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:39,029
geometries on the inside so uh in the
past um most suppressors for the last

1258
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
past um most suppressors for the last
 

1259
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,110
past um most suppressors for the last
like 100 years have been very uh kind of

1260
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
like 100 years have been very uh kind of
 

1261
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,510
like 100 years have been very uh kind of
like v-shaped uh baffles that's what's

1262
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:43,520
like v-shaped uh baffles that's what's
 

1263
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,669
like v-shaped uh baffles that's what's
on the inside um but with the the 3D

1264
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:46,679
on the inside um but with the the 3D
 

1265
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,950
on the inside um but with the the 3D
printing um and with Advanced Computer

1266
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
printing um and with Advanced Computer
 

1267
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,549
printing um and with Advanced Computer
Software we're able to model all sorts

1268
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
Software we're able to model all sorts
 

1269
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,669
Software we're able to model all sorts
of stuff we're able to rapidly prototype

1270
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:52,679
of stuff we're able to rapidly prototype
 

1271
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,789
of stuff we're able to rapidly prototype
so we're able to like very quickly kind

1272
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
so we're able to like very quickly kind
 

1273
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,909
so we're able to like very quickly kind
of hone in on like what the optimal

1274
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:56,919
of hone in on like what the optimal
 

1275
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,070
of hone in on like what the optimal
suppressor is for different calibers

1276
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,080
suppressor is for different calibers
 

1277
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,750
suppressor is for different calibers
um and we kind of have like three things

1278
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:00,760
um and we kind of have like three things
 

1279
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,070
um and we kind of have like three things
that we're looking at we're looking at

1280
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
that we're looking at we're looking at
 

1281
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,630
that we're looking at we're looking at
flash suppression we're looking at sound

1282
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:03,640
flash suppression we're looking at sound
 

1283
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,549
flash suppression we're looking at sound
suppression and then the toxic fume is

1284
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:05,559
suppression and then the toxic fume is
 

1285
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,549
suppression and then the toxic fume is
kind of uh and the low back pressure

1286
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:07,559
kind of uh and the low back pressure
 

1287
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,750
kind of uh and the low back pressure
thing is something that is the

1288
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:08,760
thing is something that is the
 

1289
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,190
thing is something that is the
relatively new uh thing that the the

1290
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
relatively new uh thing that the the
 

1291
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,470
relatively new uh thing that the the
industry is all kind of moving towards

1292
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
industry is all kind of moving towards
 

1293
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,710
industry is all kind of moving towards
um but this is something that we were

1294
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:15,720
um but this is something that we were
 

1295
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,029
um but this is something that we were
kind of some of the first to develop

1296
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
kind of some of the first to develop
 

1297
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,430
kind of some of the first to develop
with the US military um and with their

1298
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
with the US military um and with their
 

1299
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,990
with the US military um and with their
input uh to kind of really develop these

1300
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
input uh to kind of really develop these
 

1301
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,390
input uh to kind of really develop these
products yeah so the gun itself is is

1302
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
products yeah so the gun itself is is
 

1303
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,230
products yeah so the gun itself is is
obviously like really cool um we had

1304
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,240
obviously like really cool um we had
 

1305
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,310
obviously like really cool um we had
like an entire Council of of of women at

1306
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
like an entire Council of of of women at
 

1307
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,389
like an entire Council of of of women at
our company um because I think there was

1308
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:32,399
our company um because I think there was
 

1309
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,789
our company um because I think there was
a lot of feedback that we had from the

1310
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:33,799
a lot of feedback that we had from the
 

1311
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,470
a lot of feedback that we had from the
industry like there are a lot of

1312
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:35,480
industry like there are a lot of
 

1313
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,909
industry like there are a lot of
companies in the past that were trying

1314
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:36,919
companies in the past that were trying
 

1315
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:39,190
companies in the past that were trying
to like sell pink J frames and all that

1316
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
to like sell pink J frames and all that
 

1317
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,350
to like sell pink J frames and all that
stuff and I think you know internally a

1318
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:42,360
stuff and I think you know internally a
 

1319
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,430
stuff and I think you know internally a
lot of a lot of us saw that like that's

1320
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:44,440
lot of a lot of us saw that like that's
 

1321
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,870
lot of a lot of us saw that like that's
not exactly what women want so like we

1322
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
not exactly what women want so like we
 

1323
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,590
not exactly what women want so like we
had a whole lot of input trying to

1324
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:48,600
had a whole lot of input trying to
 

1325
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,149
had a whole lot of input trying to
develop it based on what what you know

1326
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:51,159
develop it based on what what you know
 

1327
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,470
develop it based on what what you know
those customers were looking for um so

1328
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:53,480
those customers were looking for um so
 

1329
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,630
those customers were looking for um so
we wanted to make sure that like you

1330
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
we wanted to make sure that like you
 

1331
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,909
we wanted to make sure that like you
know it was aesthetic it wasn't tacky so

1332
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
know it was aesthetic it wasn't tacky so
 

1333
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,750
know it was aesthetic it wasn't tacky so
uh we obviously have just touches of

1334
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
uh we obviously have just touches of
 

1335
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,950
uh we obviously have just touches of
color um but there's also functional

1336
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:01,960
color um but there's also functional
 

1337
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,269
color um but there's also functional
things that we wanted to put in to make

1338
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
things that we wanted to put in to make
 

1339
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,630
things that we wanted to put in to make
it more pleasant to shoot but also still

1340
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:05,640
it more pleasant to shoot but also still
 

1341
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,510
it more pleasant to shoot but also still
uh very concealable so some things

1342
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
uh very concealable so some things
 

1343
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,789
uh very concealable so some things
you'll notice um is that grip so that's

1344
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:09,799
you'll notice um is that grip so that's
 

1345
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,590
you'll notice um is that grip so that's
a rose pattern grip but that actually is

1346
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
a rose pattern grip but that actually is
 

1347
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,470
a rose pattern grip but that actually is
laser etched in that gives you good

1348
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:13,480
laser etched in that gives you good
 

1349
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,950
laser etched in that gives you good
traction while not being so aggressive

1350
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:15,960
traction while not being so aggressive
 

1351
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,350
traction while not being so aggressive
that it's like if you're carrying inside

1352
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
that it's like if you're carrying inside
 

1353
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,430
that it's like if you're carrying inside
the waistband that it's going to

1354
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:18,440
the waistband that it's going to
 

1355
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,669
the waistband that it's going to
completely chew up your skin definitely

1356
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:20,679
completely chew up your skin definitely
 

1357
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,070
completely chew up your skin definitely
seen But if you grip on there it's it

1358
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,080
seen But if you grip on there it's it
 

1359
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,310
seen But if you grip on there it's it
gives plenty of traction another thing

1360
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,320
gives plenty of traction another thing
 

1361
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,630
gives plenty of traction another thing
that we kind of developed in the last

1362
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
that we kind of developed in the last
 

1363
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,909
that we kind of developed in the last
couple of years if you flip this side

1364
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:28,919
couple of years if you flip this side
 

1365
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,830
couple of years if you flip this side
we have a slide integrated compensator

1366
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:30,840
we have a slide integrated compensator
 

1367
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,470
we have a slide integrated compensator
so this is something that we patented um

1368
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:33,480
so this is something that we patented um
 

1369
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,389
so this is something that we patented um
it's kind of cool so compensators have

1370
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:35,399
it's kind of cool so compensators have
 

1371
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:36,750
it's kind of cool so compensators have
been around for a while but there's been

1372
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:36,760
been around for a while but there's been
 

1373
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,230
been around for a while but there's been
a lot of downsides to compensators um

1374
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,240
a lot of downsides to compensators um
 

1375
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,310
a lot of downsides to compensators um
some of them you have to basically take

1376
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,320
some of them you have to basically take
 

1377
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,990
some of them you have to basically take
off the compensator completely off if

1378
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,000
off the compensator completely off if
 

1379
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,269
off the compensator completely off if
you want to clean it this one

1380
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:44,279
you want to clean it this one
 

1381
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,909
you want to clean it this one
disassembles just like an ordinary

1382
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
disassembles just like an ordinary
 

1383
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,750
disassembles just like an ordinary
pistol um another side benefit is that

1384
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:48,760
pistol um another side benefit is that
 

1385
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,269
pistol um another side benefit is that
this isn't as ammo sensitive so some

1386
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
this isn't as ammo sensitive so some
 

1387
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,110
this isn't as ammo sensitive so some
other bar mounted compensators you have

1388
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
other bar mounted compensators you have
 

1389
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,149
other bar mounted compensators you have
to fiddle with the Springs you have to

1390
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:55,159
to fiddle with the Springs you have to
 

1391
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,269
to fiddle with the Springs you have to
fiddle with the ammo and even then it's

1392
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
fiddle with the ammo and even then it's
 

1393
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,510
fiddle with the ammo and even then it's
still kind of borderline reliability

1394
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
still kind of borderline reliability
 

1395
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,830
still kind of borderline reliability

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,549
for people to get into it for the first
time and what's the price so uh it it'll

1510
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:05,559
time and what's the price so uh it it'll
 

1511
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,590
time and what's the price so uh it it'll
uh depend on the the N uh 9 mil versus

uh depend on the the N uh 9 mil versus
380 and then red dots so it kind of

1514
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
380 and then red dots so it kind of
 

1515
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,549
380 and then red dots so it kind of
varies um but the non uh Red Dot

1516

so that it was controllable okay so what

1550
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:48,279
so that it was controllable okay so what
 

1551
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,710
so that it was controllable okay so what
do we have here uh we have a variety of

1552
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
do we have here uh we have a variety of
 

1553
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,590
do we have here uh we have a variety of
uh different Sig pistols um a couple

1554
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:52,600
uh different Sig pistols um a couple
 

1555
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,950
uh different Sig pistols um a couple
different families we've got some 1911s

1556
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
different families we've got some 1911s
 

1557
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,430
different families we've got some 1911s
some 320s some uh 365's as well as some

1558
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
some 320s some uh 365's as well as some
 

1559
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,509
some 320s some uh 365's as well as some
226s um so I guess on the competition

1560
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:02,519
226s um so I guess on the competition
 

1561
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,269
226s um so I guess on the competition
side it kind of depends like there's we

three-way adjustable triggers they're

1580
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:25,720
three-way adjustable triggers they're
 

1581
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,230
three-way adjustable triggers they're
I've been handing them to people all day

1582

very surprised when they pull the
trigger it's definitely something that's

1588
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
trigger it's definitely something that's
 

1589
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,350
trigger it's definitely something that's
very cool um which one sorry which one

1590

very cool um which one sorry which one
 

1591
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,470
very cool um which one sorry which one
was that so there's actually two

1592
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
was that so there's actually two
 

1593
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,110
was that so there's actually two
variants that we have we have the X5

1594
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,120
variants that we have we have the X5
 

1595
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,509
variants that we have we have the X5
Legion and then we have the X5 Reserve

1596
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:39,519
Legion and then we have the X5 Reserve
 

1597
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,430
Legion and then we have the X5 Reserve
um so this one's a little bit more of a

1598
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
um so this one's a little bit more of a
 

1599
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,190
um so this one's a little bit more of a
little more blingy um that one's kind of

1600
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
little more blingy um that one's kind of
 

1601
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,350
little more blingy um that one's kind of
a limited edition uh uh pistol but some

1602
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,360
a limited edition uh uh pistol but some
 

1603

similarities some differences um but
 

1605
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,110
similarities some differences um but
those are two uh compensated kind of

1606
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,120
those are two uh compensated kind of
 

1607
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,149
those are two uh compensated kind of
similar to what we saw earli on the 365

1608

of different stuff depending on like

1672
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:08,880
of different stuff depending on like
 

1673

what you're looking to you know shoot
competitions with um I've shot this gun

1676
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:13,880
competitions with um I've shot this gun
 

1677
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,430
competitions with um I've shot this gun
um in the tackle games um where you know

1678
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
um in the tackle games um where you know
 

1679
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,629
um in the tackle games um where you know
some competitions uh will bump you up

1680
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:19,639
some competitions uh will bump you up
 

1681
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:20,909
some competitions uh will bump you up
into a different division with a

1682
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:20,919
into a different division with a
 

1683
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:23,029
into a different division with a
compensator so it all kind of depends on

1684
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,039
compensator so it all kind of depends on
 

1685
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,110
compensator so it all kind of depends on
on what competition you're deciding to

1686
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,120
on what competition you're deciding to
 

1687
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,710
on what competition you're deciding to
shoot so you'll obviously have to look

1688
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,720
shoot so you'll obviously have to look
 

1689
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,549
shoot so you'll obviously have to look
in kind of the rule book of what the

1690
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
in kind of the rule book of what the
 

1691
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,590
in kind of the rule book of what the
divisions are but so for something like

1692
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:30,600
divisions are but so for something like
 

1693
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,070
divisions are but so for something like
tactical games do you think that would

1694
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
tactical games do you think that would
 

1695
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,750
tactical games do you think that would
be the best option um this is this is

1696
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:34,760
be the best option um this is this is
 

1697
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,190
be the best option um this is this is
something that I liked um I kind of took

1698
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
something that I liked um I kind of took
 

1699
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,750
something that I liked um I kind of took
this slide off and actually put on a

1700
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:38,760
this slide off and actually put on a
 

1701
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,669
this slide off and actually put on a
polymer grip um but that's kind of

1702
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:41,679
polymer grip um but that's kind of
 

1703

1813
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,830
AMR if you want to take a peek out there
look at that put the magnifier

1814
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:00,840

 

1815
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,070

in wow so I'll kind of describe what

1816
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,080
in wow so I'll kind of describe what
 

1817
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,990
in wow so I'll kind of describe what
she's seeing so with just the Red Dot I

1818
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,000
she's seeing so with just the Red Dot I
 

1819
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,230
she's seeing so with just the Red Dot I
have this set there's four different

1820
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,240
have this set there's four different
 

1821
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,470
have this set there's four different
retical settings that you can choose the

1822
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
retical settings that you can choose the
 

1823
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,869
retical settings that you can choose the
way I have it set up right now is a

1824
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:11,879
way I have it set up right now is a
 

1825
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,629
way I have it set up right now is a
circle dot so I think what a lot of

1826
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:13,639
circle dot so I think what a lot of
 

1827
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,310
circle dot so I think what a lot of
people have heard of like the Donut of

1828
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:15,320
people have heard of like the Donut of
 

1829
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,109
people have heard of like the Donut of
death um that allows you to have

1830
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:17,119
death um that allows you to have
 

1831
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,430
death um that allows you to have
something super bright super fast at one

1832
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:20,440
something super bright super fast at one
 

1833
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,710
something super bright super fast at one
power and then when I flipped it over I

1834
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
power and then when I flipped it over I
 

1835
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,149
power and then when I flipped it over I
have it so that there's BDC dots and I

1836
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:25,159
have it so that there's BDC dots and I
 

1837
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,710
have it so that there's BDC dots and I
also had it actually at a lower

1838
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
also had it actually at a lower
 

1839
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,510
also had it actually at a lower
brightness so you have the ability to

1840
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,520
brightness so you have the ability to
 

1841
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,909
brightness so you have the ability to
adjust both the reticle and the

1842
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:30,919
adjust both the reticle and the
 

1843
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:33,950
adjust both the reticle and the
brightness of both of these it basically

1844
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:33,960
brightness of both of these it basically
 

1845
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,829
brightness of both of these it basically
saves what your setting is with just a

1846
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:36,839
saves what your setting is with just a
 

1847
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:39,909
saves what your setting is with just a
red dot or magnified so having that

1848
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:39,919
red dot or magnified so having that
 

1849
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:41,470
red dot or magnified so having that
lower brightness also means that you

1850
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:41,480
lower brightness also means that you
 

1851
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,389
lower brightness also means that you
have a more precise shooting uh uh

1852
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:44,399
have a more precise shooting uh uh
 

1853
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,109
have a more precise shooting uh uh
aiming Point uh when you want to shoot

1854
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:47,119
aiming Point uh when you want to shoot
 

1855
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,109
aiming Point uh when you want to shoot
something at a little bit further

1856
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:48,119
something at a little bit further
 

1857
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,149
something at a little bit further
distance or you want a little bit finer

1858
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159

and right-handed uh able to do that
 

1947
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,270
and right-handed uh able to do that
another cool thing that we kind of did

1948
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,280
another cool thing that we kind of did
 

1949
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,710
another cool thing that we kind of did
was we moved the rear sight to the front

1950
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:26,720
was we moved the rear sight to the front
 

1951
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,950
was we moved the rear sight to the front
of the optic the optic plate now is more

1952
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
of the optic the optic plate now is more
 

1953
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,750
of the optic the optic plate now is more
of like a a washer so this one has a

1954
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:31,760
of like a a washer so this one has a
 

1955
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,750
of like a a washer so this one has a
Trion HD RMR HD on there so this this

1956
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:35,760
Trion HD RMR HD on there so this this
 

1957
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,790
Trion HD RMR HD on there so this this
will bolt actually through the plate all

1958
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:37,800
will bolt actually through the plate all
 

1959
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,870
will bolt actually through the plate all
the way to the slide itself so a lot of

1960
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:39,880
the way to the slide itself so a lot of
 

1961
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,190
the way to the slide itself so a lot of
other guns have it where you're going to

1962
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,200
other guns have it where you're going to
 

1963
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,550
other guns have it where you're going to
bolt the the slide um to the actual

1964
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:43,560
bolt the the slide um to the actual
 

1965
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,309
bolt the the slide um to the actual
optic um piece and then optic to that so

1966
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:46,319
optic um piece and then optic to that so
 

1967
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:49,270
optic um piece and then optic to that so
we don't have to worry about that um

1968
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
we don't have to worry about that um

we currently offer uh this gun doesn't

1994
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:14,400
we currently offer uh this gun doesn't
 

1995
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,550
we currently offer uh this gun doesn't

option as well the slide on on the 4.5

2000
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,240
option as well the slide on on the 4.5
 

2001
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,069
option as well the slide on on the 4.5
is the same as the 4in gun so it's a

2002
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:24,079
is the same as the 4in gun so it's a
 

2003
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,510
is the same as the 4in gun so it's a
basically a 4in slide with a/ in sight

2004
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:26,520
basically a 4in slide with a/ in sight
 

2005
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,870
basically a 4in slide with a/ in sight
block on it so the reciprocating mass of

2006
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:28,880
block on it so the reciprocating mass of
 

2007
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,950
block on it so the reciprocating mass of
the slide is still going to cycle rather

2008
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
the slide is still going to cycle rather
 

2009
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,550
the slide is still going to cycle rather

the US domestic market now one of the
 

2171
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,710
the US domestic market now one of the
big challenges in bringing this is the

2172
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:20,720
big challenges in bringing this is the
 

2173
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,950
big challenges in bringing this is the
fact that ammo can be pretty scarce so

2174
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
fact that ammo can be pretty scarce so
 

2175
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,870
fact that ammo can be pretty scarce so
we decided to chamber this in 300

2176
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
we decided to chamber this in 300
 

2177
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,390
we decided to chamber this in 300
Blackout make it a little bit more user

BNT here and they've made us a beautiful
can it is a solid one piece uh can

2186
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:37,319
can it is a solid one piece uh can
 

2187
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:39,309
can it is a solid one piece uh can
produce out of inkel through 3D printing

technology um super excited to see this

2190
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
technology um super excited to see this
 

2191
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,750
technology um super excited to see this
project come to life we actually started

2192
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:43,760
project come to life we actually started
 

2193
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,109
project come to life we actually started
this project about a year and a half ago

2194
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:46,119
this project about a year and a half ago
 

2195
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,670
this project about a year and a half ago
uh we first started building blank

2196
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:47,680
uh we first started building blank
 

2197
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,309
uh we first started building blank
firing kit guns and that evolved as we

2198
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:50,319
firing kit guns and that evolved as we
 

2199
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,910
firing kit guns and that evolved as we
started showing off some of our projects

2200
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:51,920
started showing off some of our projects
 

2201
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,390
started showing off some of our projects
on social media uh more important people

2202
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,400
on social media uh more important people
 

2203
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,030
on social media uh more important people
would reach out and say hey we really

2204
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,040
would reach out and say hey we really
 

2205
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,950
would reach out and say hey we really
want one of those guns you know the big

2206
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:57,960
want one of those guns you know the big
 

2207
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,829
want one of those guns you know the big
issue being is that you know the parts

2208
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
issue being is that you know the parts
 

2209
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,109
issue being is that you know the parts
just don't exist so we ended up taking

2210
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:02,119
just don't exist so we ended up taking
 

2211
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,870
just don't exist so we ended up taking
it upon ourselves to slowly scan and

2212
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:03,880
it upon ourselves to slowly scan and
 

2213
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,190
it upon ourselves to slowly scan and
design and and mock up a gun that would

2214
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,200
design and and mock up a gun that would
 

2215
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,150
design and and mock up a gun that would
eventually become a working prototype um

2216
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,160
eventually become a working prototype um
 

2217
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,990
eventually become a working prototype um
we started modeling back in October uh

2218
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
we started modeling back in October uh
 

2219
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,470
we started modeling back in October uh
at this point we were about a year and a

2220
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:13,480
at this point we were about a year and a
 

2221
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,829
at this point we were about a year and a
half in development year year and a half

2222
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:14,839
half in development year year and a half
 

2223
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,510
half in development year year and a half
in development um I reached out to BNT

2224
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
in development um I reached out to BNT
 

2225
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,790
in development um I reached out to BNT
because we really just wanted to focus

2226
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
because we really just wanted to focus
 

2227
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,069
because we really just wanted to focus
on the gun and partner with another

2228
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:21,079
on the gun and partner with another
 

2229
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,030
on the gun and partner with another
company that would have uh the

2230
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
company that would have uh the
 

2231
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,470
company that would have uh the
manufacturing ability but also the

2232
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
manufacturing ability but also the
 

2233
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,109
manufacturing ability but also the
vision to create something new and bring

2243
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,470
a true to design QD one piece
design so it has the same lockup system

2244
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:38,480
design so it has the same lockup system
 

2245

figure it out um we still haven't quite
figured it out 100% you know but we're

2296
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:45,520
figured it out 100% you know but we're
 

2297

figured it out 100% you know but we're
slowly getting there you know one step

2298
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:46,839
slowly getting there you know one step
 

2299

December so we we had a very short
 

2327
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,069
December so we we had a very short
timeline to get some guns together

2328
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:18,079
timeline to get some guns together
 

2329
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,549
timeline to get some guns together
roughly 78 weeks we put together you

2330

know two no time at all two different
 

2333
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,190
know two no time at all two different
prototypes two different op systems so

2334
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
prototypes two different op systems so
 

2335
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,309
prototypes two different op systems so
uh it's been an absolute blast it's been

2336
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:27,319
uh it's been an absolute blast it's been
 

2337
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:30,109
uh it's been an absolute blast it's been
chaotic I'm exhausted I'm sure I'm super

2338
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:30,119
chaotic I'm exhausted I'm sure I'm super
 

2339
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,270
chaotic I'm exhausted I'm sure I'm super
happy but um you know I'm excited to see

2340
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:32,280
happy but um you know I'm excited to see
 

2341
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,589
happy but um you know I'm excited to see
where this continues to develop and what

2342
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:34,599
where this continues to develop and what
 

2343
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,630
where this continues to develop and what
kind of refinement we get out of uh this

2344
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:36,640
kind of refinement we get out of uh this
 

2345
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,829
kind of refinement we get out of uh this
particular platform have you shot this

2346
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:38,839
particular platform have you shot this
 

2347
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,549
particular platform have you shot this
yet this particular model no okay it's

2348
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:41,559
yet this particular model no okay it's
 

2349
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:44,030
yet this particular model no okay it's
funny this this paint the paint was

2350
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,040
funny this this paint the paint was
 

2351
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,790
funny this this paint the paint was
still drying on this 24 hours or 48

2352
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:46,800
still drying on this 24 hours or 48
 

2353
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,309
still drying on this 24 hours or 48
hours prior to coming out here really um

2354
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:49,319
hours prior to coming out here really um
 

2355
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,109
hours prior to coming out here really um
so it was an absolute race to get this

2356
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:51,119
so it was an absolute race to get this
 

2357
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,390
so it was an absolute race to get this

be right there awesome and then do you
 

2385
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,230
be right there awesome and then do you
know how much it's going to cost yeah

2386
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,240
know how much it's going to cost yeah
 

2387
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,870

6500 uh per rifle we're planning on

2390
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:34,680
6500 uh per rifle we're planning on
 

2391
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,750
6500 uh per rifle we're planning on
doing it as like full deployment package

2392
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:36,760
doing it as like full deployment package
 

2393
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,549
doing it as like full deployment package
you're going to end up with a nice solid

2394
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:38,559
you're going to end up with a nice solid
 

2395
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:40,270
you're going to end up with a nice solid
case the gun breaks down so it'll be

2396
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:40,280
case the gun breaks down so it'll be
 

2397
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,309
case the gun breaks down so it'll be
very compact you're going to get a sling

2398
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:42,319
very compact you're going to get a sling
 

2399
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,309
very compact you're going to get a sling
you'll have your choice of stocks uh as

2400
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:44,319
you'll have your choice of stocks uh as
 

2401
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,790
you'll have your choice of stocks uh as
well as a Optics rail as well what's up

guys we're here at Shot Show 2025 I'm

2404
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:48,839
guys we're here at Shot Show 2025 I'm
 

2405
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,549
guys we're here at Shot Show 2025 I'm
here with Sterling at the sholo booth

2406
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:50,559
here with Sterling at the sholo booth
 

2407
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,230
here with Sterling at the sholo booth
we're going to be talking about what

2408
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240
we're going to be talking about what
 

2409
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,190
we're going to be talking about what
they have new for 2025 it sounds like

2410
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,200
they have new for 2025 it sounds like
 

2411
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,549
they have new for 2025 it sounds like
correct me if I'm wrong sounds like we

2412
00:44:55,549 --> 00:44:55,559
correct me if I'm wrong sounds like we
 

2413
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,030
correct me if I'm wrong sounds like we
have some update to the Blackjack and

2414
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,040
have some update to the Blackjack and
 

2415
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,630
have some update to the Blackjack and
and then a new product is that correct

2416
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,640
and then a new product is that correct
 

2417
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,270
and then a new product is that correct
correct so when we first launched the

2418
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:00,280
correct so when we first launched the
 

2419
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,990
correct so when we first launched the
Blackjack we used to run a detent delay

2420
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
Blackjack we used to run a detent delay
 

2421
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,630
Blackjack we used to run a detent delay
blowback we punted that system um and

2422
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:04,640
blowback we punted that system um and
 

2423
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,870
blowback we punted that system um and
now go to a roll pin delay system we

2424
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
now go to a roll pin delay system we
 

2425
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,030
now go to a roll pin delay system we
found it much better it's actually more

2426
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,040
found it much better it's actually more
 

2427
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,790
found it much better it's actually more
fluid it reduces all the friction that

2428
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:10,800
fluid it reduces all the friction that
 

2429
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,190
fluid it reduces all the friction that
we were problem problem we having with

2430
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:12,200
we were problem problem we having with
 

2431
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,870
we were problem problem we having with
detents after seven th several thousand

2432
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:14,880
detents after seven th several thousand
 

2433
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,950
detents after seven th several thousand
rounds they were wearing funny they were

2434
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:16,960
rounds they were wearing funny they were
 

2435
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,950
rounds they were wearing funny they were
causing binding and then breaking the

2436
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
causing binding and then breaking the
 

2437
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,670
causing binding and then breaking the
ears off of the detents so we took that

2438
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:21,680
ears off of the detents so we took that
 

2439
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,510
ears off of the detents so we took that
design and threw it out basically

2440
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
design and threw it out basically
 

2441
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,790
design and threw it out basically
redesigned and now we have our roll pin

2442
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:25,800
redesigned and now we have our roll pin
 

2443
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,670
redesigned and now we have our roll pin
system which is more fluid like I said

2444
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
system which is more fluid like I said
 

2445
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,109
system which is more fluid like I said
it has a pin that actually rolls in

2446
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:29,119
it has a pin that actually rolls in
 

2447
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,990
it has a pin that actually rolls in
there and it locks into our recoil

2448
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:31,000
there and it locks into our recoil
 

2449
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,549
there and it locks into our recoil
spring Rod so when it's in battery it

2450
00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:33,559
spring Rod so when it's in battery it
 

2451
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:35,870
spring Rod so when it's in battery it
fully locks and snaps in so that's what

2452
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:35,880
fully locks and snaps in so that's what
 

2453
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,990
fully locks and snaps in so that's what
it's overcoming so initially I I think

2454
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
it's overcoming so initially I I think
 

2455
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,109
it's overcoming so initially I I think
you talked about in your video a little

2456
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119
you talked about in your video a little
 

2457
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,390
you talked about in your video a little
bit the initial lock up it's like a

2458
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:40,400
bit the initial lock up it's like a
 

2459
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,710
bit the initial lock up it's like a
little tough at first and as it wears in

2460
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:42,720
little tough at first and as it wears in
 

2461
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,030
little tough at first and as it wears in
that spring wears in it gets a little

2462
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,040
that spring wears in it gets a little
 

2463
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,549
that spring wears in it gets a little
smoother helps so cycling so what other

2464
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:47,559
smoother helps so cycling so what other
 

2465
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:49,430
smoother helps so cycling so what other
changes to the black deck are there so

2466
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
changes to the black deck are there so
 

2467
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,790
changes to the black deck are there so
the other thing we're doing this year

2468
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:50,800
the other thing we're doing this year
 

2469
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,990
the other thing we're doing this year
with the new system in it it also has a

2470
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:53,000
with the new system in it it also has a
 

2471
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,510
with the new system in it it also has a

a 4-in barrel or rifle once so they can
 

2515
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,109
a 4-in barrel or rifle once so they can
change their configuration really fast

2516

so what's the what's the price of this
 

2567
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,390
so what's the what's the price of this
new one we don't have a price fully

2568
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:31,400
new one we don't have a price fully
 

2569
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,430
new one we don't have a price fully
dialed in because like I said we're

00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,150
to talk about the CZ Bren yes so this is
the uh the Bren 3 um so a lot the Bren 2

2782
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:25,160
the uh the Bren 3 um so a lot the Bren 2
 

2783
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,870
the uh the Bren 3 um so a lot the Bren 2
came out a couple years ago and it's

2784
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:26,880
came out a couple years ago and it's
 

2785
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,549
came out a couple years ago and it's
been used extensively right now in some

2786
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:28,559
been used extensively right now in some
 

2787
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,470
been used extensively right now in some
overseas conflicts that uh I'm sure

2788
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:30,480
overseas conflicts that uh I'm sure
 

2789
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,589
overseas conflicts that uh I'm sure
everyone's quite aware of but the Bren 3

2790
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:32,599
everyone's quite aware of but the Bren 3
 

2791
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:33,990
everyone's quite aware of but the Bren 3
actually came out of those conflicts

2792
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
actually came out of those conflicts
 

2793
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,589
actually came out of those conflicts
from uh from feedback we've been getting

2794
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
from uh from feedback we've been getting
 

2795
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,670
from uh from feedback we've been getting
from end users so the Bren 2 is still an

2796
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,680
from end users so the Bren 2 is still an
 

2797
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,390
from end users so the Bren 2 is still an
excellent platform still very reliable

2798
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:39,400
excellent platform still very reliable
 

2799
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,510
excellent platform still very reliable
durable service rifle we've just added a

2800
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
durable service rifle we've just added a
 

2801
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,069
durable service rifle we've just added a
couple long-term durability uh upgrades

2802
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:44,079
couple long-term durability uh upgrades
 

2803
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,109
couple long-term durability uh upgrades
over here to the three models so uh I'll

2804
00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:46,119
over here to the three models so uh I'll
 

2805
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,630
over here to the three models so uh I'll
start front to back so the first most

2806
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640
start front to back so the first most
 

2807
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,109
start front to back so the first most
obvious thing you can see is an extended

2808
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:50,119
obvious thing you can see is an extended
 

2809
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:52,390
obvious thing you can see is an extended
handguard here that's mlock so uh

2810
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
handguard here that's mlock so uh
 

2811
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,829
handguard here that's mlock so uh
previously on the brand 2 you had kind

2812
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
previously on the brand 2 you had kind
 

2813
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,710
previously on the brand 2 you had kind
of a short truncated hand card due to

2814
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:55,720
of a short truncated hand card due to
 

2815
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,710
of a short truncated hand card due to
the fact that the receiver was uh

2816
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:57,720
the fact that the receiver was uh
 

2817
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,630
the fact that the receiver was uh
monolithic but this one goes out a

2818
00:51:59,630 --> 00:51:59,640
monolithic but this one goes out a
 

2819
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,109
monolithic but this one goes out a
little bit further you've got some QD

2820
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:01,119
little bit further you've got some QD
 

2821
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,030
little bit further you've got some QD
slots on either side and also as you can

2822
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:03,040
slots on either side and also as you can
 

2823
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,870
slots on either side and also as you can
see here this Ingress here for you to

2824
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:04,880
see here this Ingress here for you to
 

2825
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,589
see here this Ingress here for you to
access the gas Port adjustment knob um

2826
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
access the gas Port adjustment knob um
 

2827
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,309
access the gas Port adjustment knob um
the gas Port adjustment has also changed

2828
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:09,319
the gas Port adjustment has also changed
 

2829
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:10,870
the gas Port adjustment has also changed
a little bit it's still three settings

2830
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:10,880
a little bit it's still three settings
 

2831
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,829
a little bit it's still three settings
the same way it is on the brand 2

2832
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:12,839
the same way it is on the brand 2
 

2833
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,789
the same way it is on the brand 2
however instead of the fully off setting

2834
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:14,799
however instead of the fully off setting
 

2835
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,549
however instead of the fully off setting
that we had on the Bren 2 this one has a

2836
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:16,559
that we had on the Bren 2 this one has a
 

2837
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,150
that we had on the Bren 2 this one has a
designated suppressed setting so little

2838
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:19,160
designated suppressed setting so little
 

2839
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,950
designated suppressed setting so little
bit nicer uh instead of using rifle

2840
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:20,960
bit nicer uh instead of using rifle
 

2841
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,510
bit nicer uh instead of using rifle
grenades more people using suppressors

2842
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:22,520
grenades more people using suppressors
 

2843
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,910
grenades more people using suppressors
so that makes a bit more sense uh moving

2844
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:24,920
so that makes a bit more sense uh moving
 

2845
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,470
so that makes a bit more sense uh moving
back from there uh We've got uh the bolt

2846
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:27,480
back from there uh We've got uh the bolt
 

2847
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,630
back from there uh We've got uh the bolt
and bolt carrier um have had some minor

2848
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:29,640
and bolt carrier um have had some minor
 

2849
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,030
and bolt carrier um have had some minor
tweaks done to them so the uh the bolt

2850
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:32,040
tweaks done to them so the uh the bolt
 

2851
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,710
tweaks done to them so the uh the bolt
carrier has a new uh bolt bounce uh

2852
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:34,720
carrier has a new uh bolt bounce uh
 

2853
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,910
carrier has a new uh bolt bounce uh
prevention system uh just to stop an out

2854
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:36,920
prevention system uh just to stop an out
 

2855
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,750
prevention system uh just to stop an out
of battery detonation the bolt face

2856
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:39,760
of battery detonation the bolt face
 

2857
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,109
of battery detonation the bolt face
itself now has dual ejectors instead of

00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:42,119
itself now has dual ejectors instead of
 

2859
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,950

plastic one that's on the Bren 2 and

2868
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
plastic one that's on the Bren 2 and
 

2869
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,390
plastic one that's on the Bren 2 and
this is to prevent uh wobble and this

2870
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:57,400
this is to prevent uh wobble and this
 

2871
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,910
this is to prevent uh wobble and this
whole kind of wallering out on the

uh stock redesign is you can now drop

2876
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:03,280
uh stock redesign is you can now drop
 

2877
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,230
uh stock redesign is you can now drop
the trigger pack which by the way is

the bolt guts out of the gun from the
 

2887
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,829
the bolt guts out of the gun from the

that's an upgrade we did uh very last

2890
00:53:17,549 --> 00:53:17,559
that's an upgrade we did uh very last
 

2891
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:19,230
that's an upgrade we did uh very last
thing that I will say probably has some

00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:19,240
thing that I will say probably has some
 

2893
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,349

limited uh usage on the civilian Market

2894
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:21,359
limited uh usage on the civilian Market
 

2895
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,950
limited uh usage on the civilian Market
but it's uh very exciting from a

2896
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
but it's uh very exciting from a
 

2897
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,390
but it's uh very exciting from a
military standpoint is these four screws

2898

military standpoint is these four screws
 

2899
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,750
military standpoint is these four screws
we've got here on the side of the

we've got here on the side of the
 

2901
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,190
we've got here on the side of the
receiver so previously the uh the brand

that does have some wear uh that happens

2910
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:38,880
that does have some wear uh that happens
 

2911
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,030
that does have some wear uh that happens
a little bit quicker so being able to

2912
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:41,040
a little bit quicker so being able to
 

2913
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,630
a little bit quicker so being able to
remove this rail and also have it be

2914
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
remove this rail and also have it be
 

2915
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,309
remove this rail and also have it be
made out of steel greatly improves the

2916
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:45,319
made out of steel greatly improves the
 

2917
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:46,670
made out of steel greatly improves the
uh the service life of the upper

2918
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:46,680
uh the service life of the upper
 

2919
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,549
uh the service life of the upper
assembly itself and lets you keep that

2920
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
assembly itself and lets you keep that
 

2921
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,589
assembly itself and lets you keep that
same serial number in service for longer

2922
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:50,599
same serial number in service for longer
 

2923
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:52,910
same serial number in service for longer
so like I said the the operating

2924
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:52,920
so like I said the the operating

carry this one in the chamber with the
 

3047
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,829
carry this one in the chamber with the
manual safety on when it's all folded up

3048
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839
manual safety on when it's all folded up
 

3049
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,549
manual safety on when it's all folded up
it's uh there's no chance of it going

3050
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:11,559
it's uh there's no chance of it going
 

3051
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:14,549
it's uh there's no chance of it going
off so uh when you're ready to kind of

3052
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:14,559
off so uh when you're ready to kind of
 

3053
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,029
off so uh when you're ready to kind of
get it folded back up start back here at

3054
00:56:17,029 --> 00:56:17,039
get it folded back up start back here at
 

3055
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:19,950
get it folded back up start back here at
the grip just get it started and come to

3056
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:19,960
the grip just get it started and come to
 

3057
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,589
the grip just get it started and come to
the top of the stock

3058
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
the top of the stock
 

3059
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,990
the top of the stock
here n make sure the slides forward

3060
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:25,000
here n make sure the slides forward
 

3061
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,910
here n make sure the slides forward
first

3062
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:26,920
first
 

3063
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,710
first
then it will all fold back

3064
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:29,720
then it will all fold back
 

3065
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,549
then it will all fold back
up that's fun yeah that's really fun so

3066
00:56:33,549 --> 00:56:33,559
up that's fun yeah that's really fun so
 

3067
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:36,230
up that's fun yeah that's really fun so
I'm curious that what kind of started

3068
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:36,240
I'm curious that what kind of started
 

3069
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,069
I'm curious that what kind of started
this idea so this was something that uh

3070
00:56:39,069 --> 00:56:39,079
this idea so this was something that uh
 

3071
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:40,870
this idea so this was something that uh
like I said magpole and 08 they kind of

3072
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:40,880
like I said magpole and 08 they kind of
 

3073
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,270
like I said magpole and 08 they kind of
it was a proof of concept they just

3074
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:42,280
it was a proof of concept they just
 

3075
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,589
it was a proof of concept they just
wanted to see if they could do it yeah

3076
00:56:44,589 --> 00:56:44,599
wanted to see if they could do it yeah
 

3077
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:46,309
wanted to see if they could do it yeah
it was originally going to be a chassis

3078
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:46,319
it was originally going to be a chassis
 

3079
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,309
it was originally going to be a chassis
for a Glock firearm um and since that

3080
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:49,319
for a Glock firearm um and since that
 

3081
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:51,750
for a Glock firearm um and since that
obviously has extensive history in

3082
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,760
obviously has extensive history in
 

3083
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,910
obviously has extensive history in
making aftermarket components for for

3084
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:53,920
making aftermarket components for for
 

3085
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,990
making aftermarket components for for
Glock it just kind of made sense once we

3086
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,000
Glock it just kind of made sense once we
 

3087
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,349
Glock it just kind of made sense once we
start started developing our own pistol

3088
00:56:58,349 --> 00:56:58,359
start started developing our own pistol
 

3089
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:00,029
start started developing our own pistol
um and realized that uh it was going to

3090
00:57:00,029 --> 00:57:00,039
um and realized that uh it was going to
 

3091
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:01,750
um and realized that uh it was going to
be perfect for turning this into not

3092
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:01,760
be perfect for turning this into not
 

3093
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,069
