========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (9,3), and the apple is at (7,4). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake is moving downward. The body is at (9,4), which is directly above the head. Wait, because the head is at (9,3), and the body is at (9,4). So if the snake is moving DOWN, that means the next step would be moving from (9,3) to (9,2), right? But the body is at (9,4), so if the snake moves down, the next position would be (9,2), which is safe. But the apple is at (7,4), which is to the left and up.

First, I need to figure out a path from (9,3) to (7,4) without colliding with the body or the walls. Let's think about the movement steps. The head is at (9,3), and the body is at (9,4). Since the snake is moving DOWN, the next move can't be UP because that would reverse direction. So the first move can't be UP.

The apple is two units to the left (from x=9 to x=7) and one unit up (from y=3 to y=4). So the snake needs to move left twice and up once. But the initial direction is DOWN. So the first move can't be UP. Let's think of possible steps.

Let me try to outline possible steps. The head is at (9,3). The body is at (9,4). So moving down would take the head to (9,2), which is safe. But then the body would shift. Let's think about each step.

First, the snake's current direction is DOWN. So the next move can't be UP. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But moving RIGHT would take the head to (10,3), which is outside the grid (since x can be up to 9). So RIGHT is invalid. So the first move can be either DOWN or LEFT.

If the first move is DOWN: head moves to (9,2). The body is now [(9,3)], because the head moves to (9,2), and the previous head (9,3) becomes part of the body. Wait, no. The body cells are given as [(9,4)] which is the body excluding the head. So initially, the snake's body is [(9,4)], and the head is at (9,3). So the snake is two cells long: head at (9,3), body at (9,4). When moving, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten.

Wait, the movement update says: new head is head + direction. Then, the head becomes a body segment. The tail is removed unless apple is eaten. So, if the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed. But in this case, the apple hasn't been eaten yet, so the tail would be removed. So after moving, the body would be [previous head position].

So, initial body is [(9,4)]. If the snake moves down to (9,2), then the new head is (9,2), and the body becomes [(9,3)], because the previous head (9,3) becomes part of the body, and the tail (9,4) is removed. Wait, no. Wait, the body is the list of positions excluding the head. So when the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed. So the original body is [(9,4)], and the head is (9,3). When moving down to (9,2), the new head is (9,2). The body becomes [(9,3)], because the previous head is now part of the body. The original tail (9,4) is removed. So the body is [(9,3)].

So after moving down, the body is [(9,3)], and the head is at (9,2). Then, the next move. Let's consider that.

Alternatively, if the first move is LEFT to (8,3). Then, the body would be [(9,3)], because the previous head (9,3) becomes part of the body, and the tail (9,4) is removed. So the body becomes [(9,3)].

So, moving left first. Let's explore that path.

First move: LEFT (from (9,3) to (8,3)). Now, the body is [(9,3)].

Next, we need to get to (7,4). So from (8,3), need to move left again to (7,3), then up to (7,4). Let's check if that's possible.

After first move: head at (8,3), body [(9,3)].

Second move: LEFT to (7,3). Now, body becomes [(8,3)].

Third move: UP to (7,4). Now, the head is at (7,4), which is the apple. So the snake would eat the apple, and the body would be [(7,3), (8,3)], and the tail is not removed. So after eating, the body length increases by 1.

But we need to make sure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move. Let's check.

After eating the apple, the head is at (7,4), body is [(7,3), (8,3)]. The next move can't be DOWN (since the current direction is UP). So possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But need to check for collisions.

If the snake moves UP again, the head would be at (7,5). But that's allowed. So that's safe. So that's okay.

So the path would be LEFT, LEFT, UP. Let's check for collisions along the way.

First move: LEFT from (9,3) to (8,3). The body is [(9,3)], which is not in the new head's position. Safe.

Second move: LEFT to (7,3). The body is [(8,3)]. So new head is (7,3), which is not in the body. Safe.

Third move: UP to (7,4). That's the apple. So that's safe.

But wait, the initial direction is DOWN. The first move is LEFT, which is allowed since it's not reversing. The current direction is DOWN, and the first move is LEFT. No problem. So that's valid.

Another option: first move is DOWN, then move left twice and up once. Let's see.

First move: DOWN to (9,2). Body becomes [(9,3)]. Then, need to move left twice and up once.

From (9,2), moving left to (8,2), then left to (7,2), then up to (7,3), then up to (7,4). Wait, but that would take four moves, which is longer than the previous path.

But the previous path took three moves. So the first approach is better.

Wait, but the initial move is LEFT, then LEFT, then UP. That's three moves. Let me check the coordinates again.

Original head: (9,3). Move LEFT to (8,3). Then LEFT to (7,3). Then UP to (7,4). That's correct. So that's three moves. That's the shortest possible path, since the Manhattan distance is (9-7) + (4-3) = 2 +1 = 3. So that's optimal.

But we need to make sure that during the movement, the snake doesn't collide with its body. Let's check each step.

First step: head moves to (8,3). Body is [(9,3)]. No collision.

Second step: head moves to (7,3). Body is [(8,3)]. No collision.

Third step: head moves to (7,4). Body is [(7,3)]. No collision. So that's safe.

After eating the apple, the body becomes [(7,3), (8,3)], and the tail is not removed. So the next move can be any direction except DOWN (since the last move was UP). So possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. All are safe. For example, moving UP to (7,5) is allowed.

Therefore, this path is valid. The moves would be ["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"].

But wait, the initial direction is DOWN. The first move is LEFT, which is allowed since it's not reversing. The direction change from DOWN to LEFT is allowed. So that's okay.

Another thing to check: when the snake moves, the body shifts. Let's confirm each step.

Original body: [(9,4)].

After first move (LEFT to (8,3)): new head is (8,3). The body is [(9,3)].

After second move (LEFT to (7,3)): new head is (7,3). The body is [(8,3)].

After third move (UP to (7,4)): new head is (7,4). The body is [(7,3), (8,3)] because the apple is eaten. So that's correct.

Yes, that seems to work. So the moves are LEFT, LEFT, UP. That's three steps, which is the minimal Manhattan distance. So that's the optimal path.

But let me check if there's any alternative path. For example, moving down first, then left, then up. Let's see:

First move: DOWN to (9,2). Body becomes [(9,3)].

Then move LEFT to (8,2). Body becomes [(9,2)].

Then move LEFT to (7,2). Body becomes [(8,2)].

Then move UP to (7,3). Body becomes [(7,2)].

Then move UP to (7,4). That's five moves. Which is longer. So the first path is better.

Another option: move left, then up, then left. Let's see:

First move: LEFT to (8,3). Body [(9,3)].

Then move UP to (8,4). Body [(8,3)].

Then move LEFT to (7,4). But the body is [(8,3)], which is not in the path. So that's three moves as well. Wait, that's also three moves. Let me check:

Original head (9,3) → LEFT to (8,3) → UP to (8,4) → LEFT to (7,4). That's three moves. So that's also a valid path. Which one is better?

But in this case, after moving UP to (8,4), the next move is LEFT to (7,4). Let's check for collisions. When moving to (8,4), the body is [(8,3)]. So that's safe. Then moving to (7,4), which is the apple. So that's also valid. So that's another possible path.

Which one is better? Both are three moves. Let's compare.

First path: LEFT, LEFT, UP. Second path: LEFT, UP, LEFT. Both are valid. But need to check if any of them have issues.

In the first path, after moving to (7,3), then UP. The body is [(7,3)]? No, after the first two moves, the body is [(8,3)].

Wait, after the first move (LEFT to (8,3)), the body is [(9,3)].

After the second move (LEFT to (7,3)), the body is [(8,3)].

Then the third move is UP to (7,4). So the body is [(7,3)]. So that's safe.

In the second path: after moving LEFT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4). The body is [(8,3)].

Then moving LEFT to (7,4). So the body is [(8,4)]? No, let's think again.

After moving to (8,4), the body becomes [(8,3)] (since the previous head was (8,3), and the tail is removed. Then moving to (7,4), the body becomes [(8,4)]. Wait, no. Let me think step by step.

Original body: [(9,4)].

First move: LEFT to (8,3). New head is (8,3). Body becomes [(9,3)].

Second move: UP to (8,4). New head is (8,4). Body becomes [(8,3)].

Third move: LEFT to (7,4). New head is (7,4). Body becomes [(8,4)]. Since the apple is eaten here, the tail is not removed. So the body is [(8,4)] plus the previous head (8,4)? Wait, no. Wait, when the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed. So after moving to (7,4) (apple), the body is the previous body [(8,3)] plus the new head (8,4)? Or how does it work?

Wait, the movement process is:

- New head is calculated.
- If the new head is on the apple, then the tail is not removed. So the body grows by one segment (the apple is eaten).
- Otherwise, the tail is removed.

So, in the second path:

After first move: body is [(9,3)].

Second move: head moves to (8,4). The body is [(8,3)].

Third move: head moves to (7,4), which is the apple. So the body becomes [(8,3), (8,4)].

So the body is [(8,3), (8,4)].

So after that, the next move can't be DOWN (since the current direction is LEFT). So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP. All safe.

So both paths are valid. Which one is better? The first path is moving left twice and up once. The second is left, up, left. Both are three moves. But which one is more optimal? Both are same length. So either is acceptable.

But the problem says to use Manhattan distance as a heuristic but prioritize safety. Both paths are safe. So either is acceptable.

But the user requires the moves to be a sequence that leads to the apple. So either path is correct.

But let's check if there are any other constraints. For example, the snake cannot reverse direction. Let's see.

In the first path, the initial direction is DOWN. The first move is LEFT, which is allowed. Then the next move is LEFT again, which is same direction. Then UP. So no reverses.

In the second path, the first move is LEFT, then UP (which is a direction change, but not reverse), then LEFT again. Also no reverses.

So both are valid.

But the first path is moving left twice, then up. The second is left, up, left. Both are acceptable.

But the user may prefer one over the other. However, since both are correct, either is acceptable.

But in the first case, the moves are ["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"], which is the minimal steps. So that's the answer.

But let me check again if there's any possible collision in the first path. For example, when moving to (7,3), the body is [(8,3)]. So the new head is (7,3), which is not in the body. Correct.

Then moving to (7,4), the body is [(7,3)]. Correct.

Yes. So that's safe.

Therefore, the correct answer is the sequence of moves: LEFT, LEFT, UP.
</think>

To reach the apple located at position $(7, 4)$ starting from position $(9, 3)$, while ensuring the snake does not collide with itself and follows a valid movement pattern (i.e., no immediate reversal of direction), the optimal and shortest path is as follows:

---

### **Step-by-Step Movement Plan**

1. **Move LEFT from $(9, 3)$ to $(8, 3)$**  
   - The body is now `[(9, 3)]` (the previous head).
   - No collision with the body.
   - The direction is now **LEFT**, which is valid (not a reversal of the previous direction **DOWN**).

2. **Move LEFT from $(8, 3)$ to $(7, 3)$**  
   - The body is now `[(8, 3)]`.
   - No collision with the body.
   - Direction remains **LEFT**.

3. **Move UP from $(7, 3)$ to $(7, 4)$**  
   - This is the **apple**.
   - The body becomes `[(7, 3), (8, 3)]` (since the snake has now eaten the apple, and the tail is not removed).
   - This movement is valid and does not result in a collision.

---

### **Final Considerations**

- **Number of moves**: 3, which is the **minimum possible** based on Manhattan distance:  
  $$
  |9 - 7| + |3 - 4| = 2 + 1 = 3
  $$

- **Safety**: No self-collisions occur at any point during the movement.
- **Direction rules**: The snake never reverses its direction immediately (e.g., from **DOWN** to **UP**), ensuring compliance with typical snake game rules.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"]}
$$
