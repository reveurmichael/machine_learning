Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (0,6) to the apple at (6,5). Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the current state. The head is at (0,6), and the body extends behind it all the way to (8,6). That means the snake is a straight line along y=6 from x=0 to x=8. The apple is at (6,5), which is two units to the right and one unit down from the head.

The current direction is "LEFT", so the snake's body is extending in that direction. Wait, no—the current direction is "LEFT", but the body is behind the head in a straight line along x increasing? Hmm, wait: the body cells are [(1,6), (2,6), ..., (8,6)], which means after the head at (0,6), each subsequent body cell increases in x by 1. So that would imply that the snake is moving to the right, not left. Wait, no—the direction is "LEFT", but the body is behind it—so maybe I'm confused.

Wait, no: if the current direction is "LEFT", then the head is at (0,6), and the next body part should be one step in the opposite direction? Or wait, no. The direction determines where the head moves next, not where the body came from. Wait, no—the body follows the head's path.

Wait, let me clarify: when moving "LEFT", the head would move left (x decreases). But in this case, the head is at (0,6), and if it moves left, it would go out of bounds because x can't be less than 0. So that must mean that the current direction isn't possible—wait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait no: the current direction is "LEFT", but the body is behind in a straight line towards higher x values. That suggests that perhaps the snake was moving to the right (i.e., previous directions were RIGHT), and now it's turning LEFT. But since the head can't move left from (0,6) without dying, maybe this is an error or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait no—the current direction is "LEFT", meaning that if the snake moves next step in that direction, the new head would be (head_x -1, head_y). But since head is at (0,6), moving left would take it to (-1,6), which is out of bounds. So that can't be a valid move. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial state.

Wait no—the current direction is "LEFT", but maybe the snake was previously moving in another direction and just changed direction. But regardless, for planning the next moves, I need to focus on where the head is now (0,6) with body behind it along x=0,1,...8 at y=6.

So the apple is at (6,5), which is two units right and one down from the current head position. The snake needs to move towards that point without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds.

Given the snake's current direction is "LEFT", but moving left isn't possible because it would go off the grid. So perhaps the first move has to be a change in direction, but not reversing. Wait, movement rules say you can't reverse direction. If the current direction is LEFT, then next move cannot be RIGHT? Or wait, no: the rule says you cannot choose the opposite direction. For example, if current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN next.

Wait, the movement rules state that you cannot reverse. So if current direction is "LEFT", the next move can't be "RIGHT". Similarly for others. Also, since the current direction is LEFT, and the head is at (0,6), moving LEFT would immediately die because x becomes -1, which is out of bounds.

So first, I need to figure out what directions are possible from the current state. The current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT? Wait no: the rule says you cannot reverse, meaning if current is UP, next can't be DOWN; if current is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT, and vice versa.

Wait wait, no. Let me recheck:

Rule 2 says: Cannot reverse. If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current is LEFT, next cannot be RIGHT; if current is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT.

So in this case, the current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT. Therefore, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT? Wait no: wait, the current direction is LEFT. The movement options would exclude moving in the opposite direction (RIGHT). So from LEFT, you can choose any except RIGHT and perhaps NONE if applicable?

Wait, but the initial state's current direction is "LEFT". So for the first move, what are the possible directions? According to rule 2: since current direction is LEFT, next cannot be RIGHT. Also, movement must follow the rules that you can't reverse.

So from LEFT, possible next directions are UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT and not NONE (since NONE implies no movement, which isn't allowed as a move). Wait, no—NONE is the initial state when the snake hasn't moved yet, I think. Or perhaps in this case, since current direction is LEFT, you can choose any direction except the opposite, which is RIGHT.

Wait, no: rule 2 says that if current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT↔RIGHT. So from LEFT, you cannot choose RIGHT as the next move. But can you choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT (i.e., same direction)? Wait, I think the rule allows choosing any direction except the opposite.

Wait no: looking back at the movement rules:

Rule 2 says: Cannot reverse. If current is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So from LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT as next move, but what about other directions? Are they allowed?

Wait, I think that when the current direction is something (like LEFT), you cannot choose its opposite (RIGHT) as the next move. But you can choose any other direction, including same as current if possible.

Wait no: for example, suppose current direction is UP; then next move can't be DOWN but can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT? Or does it have to change direction?

No, I think that rule 2 says you cannot reverse. So from UP, you can choose any except DOWN; same for others.

Wait no: the exact wording is: "If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed."

So if current direction is LEFT, then next cannot be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP or DOWN.

Wait no: wait, the movement options are "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". From LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT as next; so possible directions are UP and DOWN, but also LEFT? Or does moving in same direction require the snake to continue straight?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The rule says that if current is LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT. So possible next moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (if allowed). Wait no: wait, movement from a certain direction can't choose its opposite. So from LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT; but you can choose any other direction, including continuing in the same direction.

Wait, for example, if the snake is moving LEFT and continues to move LEFT, that would mean it's not changing direction, so no problem. The rule only prohibits reversing (i.e., moving back along the previous direction). So from LEFT, next moves can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT, but not RIGHT.

Wait, I think that's correct. So in this case, current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT. Therefore, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (if allowed; but wait, if you're already moving LEFT and continue to do so, the direction remains same).

But wait, the head is at (0,6), which is x=0. If it tries to move LEFT again, that would take it out of bounds. So in this case, moving LEFT isn't possible because it's on the edge.

So from current position (0,6) with direction LEFT, possible moves are UP or DOWN, since LEFT would cause death.

Wait no: wait, if current direction is LEFT, and you choose to continue moving LEFT, then new head would be at (-1,6), which is invalid. So that's a collision, so the snake dies. Therefore, in this scenario, choosing LEFT as next move isn't possible because it would immediately die.

So from (0,6) with current direction LEFT, the only possible safe moves are UP or DOWN, as moving LEFT is fatal.

Wait but wait: can I choose to change direction without causing collision? For example, if I turn UP or DOWN and then proceed towards the apple.

The apple is at (6,5). So from (0,6), moving down would take me closer in y-coordinate. Let's see:

If I move DOWN first, head goes to (0,5). Then I can start moving RIGHT towards x=6.

But wait, let's think about the body movement. The body is currently [(1,6), (2,6), ..., (8,6)], so if I move the head down to (0,5), then the new head is at (0,5). Then the body would shift as follows:

- Insert old head (0,6) at front of the BODY list. So the new BODY becomes [(0,6), (1,6), ..., (8,6)].

Wait no: when you move, the head moves first, then each body part follows. Wait, more accurately: when the head moves, each segment in the body follows the one in front of it.

But perhaps for this problem, I can model the movement as:

When moving, all body parts follow the path of the previous segments.

Wait no—each time the head moves, the entire body shifts towards where the head was. So when you move RIGHT, each segment takes the place of the one in front of it.

But perhaps a better way is to think that after moving the head, the tail follows, so the length remains same unless you're growing (but in this problem, I don't think there's growth; the snake just moves and may die if colliding with itself).

So from current state:

Head: (0,6)

Body: [(1,6), (2,6), ..., (8,6)]

If I move down (y decreases by 1) to (0,5), then new head is at (0,5). Then the body parts shift:

The first body part (which was at (1,6)) moves to (0,6), the next one (2,6) moves to (1,6), and so on until the last body part (8,6) would be at (7,6). The tail is now at (7,6), but wait, no: perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait no. Let me think step by step:

Original positions after head:

Head: (0,6)

Body parts in order (from head to tail):

(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), ..., (8,6).

So when the head moves down to (0,5), the first body part (at 1,6) will move to where the head was: (0,6). The next one (2,6) moves to (1,6), and so on until the last body part (8,6) would be at position 7,6.

Wait no: when the head moves, each segment follows the previous one. So after moving down:

New head: (0,5)

Body parts:

(1,6) → where was the head before? No, wait: when the head moves, the body segments follow in order.

Actually, perhaps it's better to model that each time the head moves, the entire body shifts towards the new position, maintaining their relative positions. So after moving down once:

New head: (0,5)

Body parts become:

(1,6) → now at (0,6), but no—wait, when you move down from (0,6) to (0,5), then each body part behind follows the path of the previous one.

Wait no. Let's think in terms of steps:

Original positions after head:

Head: H at (0,6)

Body 1: B1 at (1,6)

Body 2: B2 at (2,6)

...

Tail: T at (8,6).

When H moves down to (0,5), then:

H is now at (0,5)

B1 follows where H was before (which was (0,6)), so B1 moves to (0,6).

Similarly, B2 follows B1's old position, which was (1,6). Wait no: perhaps each body part takes the place of the previous one.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think that when the head moves, all body parts shift forward. So:

After moving down once:

H is at (0,5)

B1 was at (1,6) and now moves to where H was before: (0,6).

B2 was at (2,6) and now moves to where B1 was: (1,6).

And so on until the tail.

So after moving down once:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6)

B2: (1,6)

...

The last body part (originally at 8,6) would be at position 7,6.

Wait no: if there are 9 segments including the head? Wait no—the body cells are from (1,6) to (8,6), which is 8 cells. So total snake length is 9 (including head). So after moving down:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6)

B2: (1,6)

...

T: (7,6).

Wait no—wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that when the head moves in a new direction, each body part takes the position of the previous one.

So, after moving down once:

H: (0,5)

B1: (1,6) → now at (0,6)

But wait no—no, when you move down, H goes from (0,6) to (0,5). Then B1 was at (1,6); it can't go into (0,6) because that's where H was. Wait no—it should follow the movement.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing myself. Maybe a better way is:

When you move in any direction, all body parts shift towards the new head position, maintaining their order.

So after moving down once from (0,6), the new positions would be:

H: (0,5)

B1: (1,6) → moves to where H was: (0,6).

Wait no—that doesn't make sense because B1 can't move diagonally; it's only allowed to move in the direction of the head.

Wait no—each body part follows the path of the previous one. So when you move down:

H moves from (0,6) → (0,5)

B1 was at (1,6); now it moves to where H was: (0,6).

But wait, that would mean B1 is now at (0,6), which is adjacent to the new head at (0,5). That can't be right because then B1 is directly above H, but movement should be sequential.

Wait no—each body part moves into the position of the previous one. So:

H moves to (0,5).

B1 moves from (1,6) to (0,6).

Because that's where H was before moving down.

Then B2 moves from (2,6) to (1,6), because it follows B1's old position.

Wait no, perhaps not. Maybe each body part just shifts forward by one in the direction of movement. Wait, but movement is only possible in straight lines; turns would require changing direction step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps when you change direction, the entire body can't turn immediately and may cause collision if not done carefully.

This is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps for planning purposes, I can ignore the exact body positions as long as I ensure that moving towards the apple without immediate collision.

But let's get back to possible moves. From (0,6), current direction LEFT, which would take H out of bounds if continued. So possible next directions are UP or DOWN.

If I choose to move DOWN first, head goes to (0,5). Then I can start moving RIGHT towards x=6.

Wait, but after moving down once, the body is now in positions:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6)

B2: (1,6)

...

So if I then decide to move RIGHT, that would be allowed because current direction was DOWN, so next can't be UP. Wait no—current direction after moving down would be DOWN, so next move cannot be UP.

Wait no: when you make a move, the new direction becomes the one you chose. So from current direction LEFT, if I choose to move DOWN, then the new direction is DOWN.

So now, from (0,5), with direction DOWN, possible next moves can't be UP.

But wait, moving down again would take H to (0,4), which is further away from the apple at (6,5). So perhaps that's not ideal.

Alternatively, after moving down once, I could change direction to RIGHT and start moving towards x=6.

Wait but let's think about whether that movement would cause collision with the body.

After moving down once:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6) → which is now at x=0,y=6.

But wait, no—when H moves down to (0,5), B1 was at (1,6). Wait no—the initial body cells are [(1,6), (2,6), ..., (8,6)]. So when H moves down to (0,5), the first body part (B1) was at (1,6); it would now be where H was before: (0,6).

So after moving down once:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6)

B2: (1,6)

B3: (2,6)

...

Tail: B9: (7,6) → because original body cells were up to x=8, so after shifting, the tail would be at x=7.

Wait no, perhaps I'm miscalculating. The initial body has 8 cells (from x=1 to x=8), making total snake length 9 (including head). When H moves down, each body cell shifts forward:

H: (0,5)

B1: was at (1,6) → now at (0,6)

B2: was at (2,6) → now at (1,6)

...

The last body part was at (8,6) → now at (7,6).

So the snake's body after moving down once is:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6)

B2: (1,6)

B3: (2,6)

...

Tail: (7,6).

Now, if I decide to move RIGHT from here, H would go from (0,5) → (1,5). Let's see if that position is free.

Looking at the body parts:

H: (1,5) after moving right.

B1 was at (0,6); it moves where H was before, which is (0,5).

Wait no—that's not correct. When you move RIGHT from (0,5), H becomes (1,5). Then B1, which was at (0,6), would need to move into the position where H was: (0,5). But that's possible only if there's a path.

But wait, perhaps more accurately:

When moving right, each body part follows in order. So:

H moves from (0,5) → (1,5).

B1 was at (0,6); it can't move directly into (1,5), because that's where H is going. Wait no—each body part just shifts forward one step in the direction of movement.

Wait no: when moving right, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.

So:

H was at (0,5) → now at (1,5).

B1 was at (0,6); it can't move into (1,5), because that's where H is. Wait no—no, I think I'm mixing up directions here.

Wait, perhaps the body parts don't care about vertical movement when moving horizontally; they just follow in line.

But this is getting too complicated for my current level of understanding. Maybe a better approach is to accept that as long as I move towards the apple without immediately stepping on any part of my own body (excluding the head), it should be okay.

So, after moving down once:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6)

B2: (1,6)

...

If I then move right to (1,5), is that position free? Well, looking at the current body parts, none are at (1,5) yet. So it should be safe.

Wait no—after moving down once and then right, H would be at (1,5). The B1 would have moved from (0,6) to where H was before: (0,5).

Wait no—that can't be because when you move right, the body parts shift in that direction. So perhaps:

After first move: down → H at (0,5), B1 at (1,6) moves to (0,6).

Then moving right from (0,5):

H: (1,5)

B1: (0,6) would now be where H was before moving right, which is (0,5). So B1 moves to (0,5), but that's directly below H at (1,5). Wait no—the movement is in the same direction; perhaps they just follow in order.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach: after moving down once and then right, H would be at (1,5), and B1 would be at (0,6) → but wait, no—when you move right from (0,5), the body parts should follow in that direction.

Wait, perhaps when you change direction, each body part has to adjust accordingly. Maybe I'm better off just moving towards the apple without worrying about exact positions and see if it works.

Alternatively, maybe moving down isn't the best first step because it takes me away from the x-axis where the apple is located at (6,5). So perhaps instead of moving down, I could move right, but wait—current direction is LEFT, so I can't continue left; I have to change direction. Wait no—the current direction was LEFT when I was at (0,6); moving further left would take me out of bounds or into the body.

Wait no, from (0,6), moving left isn't possible because x=0 is the boundary. So my only options are down or up or right. But wait, can I move right? Wait, current direction was LEFT; if I change direction to RIGHT, that's allowed as long as I don't immediately collide with my body.

Wait no—current position after moving left would be a problem, but in our case, the snake is at x=0,y=6. So from here, moving right (positive x) is possible.

But wait, earlier I thought the current direction was LEFT because that's how we got to x=0,y=6. Wait no—the snake could have come from the right to reach x=0,y=6. But regardless, from (0,6), the available moves are down (y decreases) or up (if possible) or right (x increases).

Wait no—if I'm at x=0,y=6 and current direction is LEFT, then moving further left isn't possible because x can't be less than 0. So my options are to change direction to UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

If I choose to move RIGHT from here, that would mean turning around, which might cause the body parts behind me to collide with themselves if not done carefully.

Wait no—if I'm at (0,6) and decide to turn right (towards increasing x), then H moves to (1,6). Then B1, which was at (1,6), would move into where H was: (0,6). But wait, that's not possible because B1 can't be at the same position as H. Wait no—H is moving from (0,6) to (1,6), and B1 was at (1,6)—wait, that can't happen.

Wait a minute—the initial body parts are:

H: (0,6)

B1: (1,6)

B2: (2,6)

...

So if H moves right to (1,6), then B1 would try to move into where H was, which is (0,6). But that's possible because the snake can't occupy the same space as itself, except for the head. Wait no—each body part must not collide with any other part of the body.

So if H moves right from (0,6) to (1,6), then B1 was at (1,6)—but wait, that's where H is moving to. That would mean collision because B1 can't be at (1,6) while H is also there.

Wait no—that suggests that you can't move right from (0,6) if your body part is already at (1,6). Because when you move H to (1,6), the first body part was at (1,6)—so now both H and B1 would be at (1,6), which is invalid. Thus, moving right from (0,6) isn't possible because it would cause collision with B1.

Therefore, from (0,6), possible moves are DOWN or UP (if possible). Assuming y can go up as well, but the problem doesn't specify boundaries, so let's assume that movement is allowed in all directions except where it causes collision.

So moving down to (0,5) is possible. Then from there, I can start moving right towards x=6.

Wait, but when I move down once:

H: (0,5)

B1 was at (1,6); now it's at (0,6).

Then if I decide to move right from (0,5):

H moves to (1,5). Now, check if any body part is at (1,5)—the current body parts are:

After moving down once and then right:

H: (1,5)

B1: was at (0,6) → now where? It should follow H's previous position when moving right.

Wait no—when you move right from (0,5), each body part shifts in the direction of movement. So B1 would move from its current position (which after first down move was (1,6)) to where H was before moving right: (0,5). Wait that can't be—it's a diagonal move.

This is getting too confusing, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that as long as I don't step on my own body (excluding the head), it's safe. So after moving down once to (0,5), then right to (1,5), and so on towards x=6.

Alternatively, maybe a better path is to move up first if possible, but since y might not have boundaries, perhaps moving down is safer.

Wait no—the apple is at (6,5). If I'm at (0,6) and move down once to (0,5), then I can start moving right towards x=6,y=5. That seems like a good path because it directly targets the apple's position.

So the steps would be:

1. From (0,6), move DOWN to (0,5).

Check for collision: body parts after this move are (0,5) as head, then B1 at (1,6) moves to (0,6), B2 at (2,6) moves to (1,6), etc., so no collision except maybe the tail? Wait, but in this case, the tail was at (8,6); after moving down once, it would be at (7,6). So H is at (0,5), and body parts are from (0,6) to (7,6). No overlap with H, so safe.

2. Then move RIGHT repeatedly:

- Step 2: Move right to (1,5).

Check if any body part is at (1,5): current body after first move was:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6) → moved to (0,5)? Wait no—when moving down, B1 was at (1,6); when you move right, B1 should follow H's previous position.

Wait this is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to ignore the exact body positions and just focus on the path towards the apple without immediate collision.

So after step 1: at (0,5).

Step 2: move right to (1,5). Assuming no body part is there yet.

Then continue moving right:

3. (2,5)

4. (3,5)

5. (4,5)

6. (5,5)

7. (6,5) – reached the apple!

Now, I need to check if any of these steps cause collision with my own body.

Wait, but when moving right from (0,5), each subsequent move would shift the body parts accordingly. For example:

After step 1: H at (0,5), body extends from (0,6) down to (7,6). No overlap.

Step 2: Move right to (1,5). Now, H is at (1,5), and B1 moves to (0,5). Wait—that can't be because H was just there. So that would cause collision between H's new position and B1's new position.

Wait no—when you move the head, all body parts follow in sequence. So when you move right from (0,5), H becomes (1,5), and each body part takes the place of the previous one.

So:

Original after step 1:

H: (0,5)

B1: (1,6) → no, wait no—after moving down once, B1 would be at (1,6). Wait no—if you moved down from (0,6), H is now at (0,5), and the body parts are:

B1: (1,6)

B2: (2,6)

...

Tail: (8,6) → assuming initial length was 9 segments including head.

Wait no, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let's assume that after moving down once, the body is now in a vertical line from (0,5) up to (0,11) or something. Wait no—the initial positions were horizontal at y=6, so moving down would stack vertically.

Wait, perhaps it's better to visualize:

Initial position: H at (0,6), B1 at (1,6), B2 at (2,6), ..., Tail at (8,6). So length is 9 segments.

After moving down once:

H moves from (0,6) → (0,5).

B1 was at (1,6); when H moves down, the snake's body follows. But wait, no—each segment follows the movement of the head in their respective turns. Wait no—if I move down once, only the head moves; the body remains as is until subsequent moves.

Wait no—that can't be right. When you move the head, each body part follows the path of the previous one. So if H moves down from (0,6) to (0,5), then B1 would move into where H was: (0,6). Then B2 would move into where B1 was: (1,6), and so on.

Wait no—that's not correct. The body parts don't shift in the same direction as the head unless it's a continuous movement. Wait I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps when you move down once from (0,6) to (0,5), the entire snake shifts down by one segment:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6) → but that would mean B1 is now at (0,6). Wait no—if H moves down, then each body part takes the place of the previous one. So:

Original positions:

H: (0,6)

B1: (1,6)

B2: (2,6)

...

After moving down once:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6) → no, because B1 was at (1,6). Wait that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the snake moves.

Wait no—when you move the head in a direction, each body segment follows the path of the previous one. So:

If H is at (0,6), and you move down to (0,5), then B1 would move from (1,6) to where H was: (0,6). Then B2 would move from (2,6) to where B1 was: (1,6), and so on.

So after the first down move:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6)

B2: (1,6)

B3: (2,6)

...

Tail: (7,6).

Wait no—that would mean that B1 is at (0,6), which was where H was before moving. So the body parts are now:

(0,5) → H

(0,6) → B1

(1,6) → B2

(2,6) → B3

...

So no collision with H at (0,5). That seems okay.

Then, if I decide to move right from (0,5):

H moves to (1,5).

B1 was at (0,6); it would now move where H was: (0,5). But that's directly below H's new position. Wait no—H is at (1,5), and B1 is moving from (0,6) to (0,5), which is a different x-coordinate. So no collision there.

Wait, but (0,5) is the same y as H's new position, but different x. So that should be okay.

Then B2 would move from (1,6) to where B1 was: (0,6). Wait no—no, because when you move right, each body part follows in that direction. Maybe I'm overcomplicating again.

In any case, as long as H doesn't step on any body part except its own previous position (which is allowed), it should be okay.

So proceeding:

Step 1: Move down from (0,6) → (0,5).

No collision.

Step 2: Move right from (0,5) → (1,5).

Check if any body parts are at (1,5). Current body after step 1 is:

H: (0,5)

B1: (0,6)

B2: (1,6)

...

So no one is at (1,5). Safe.

Step 3: Move right to (2,5).

Similarly, safe.

Continuing this way until reaching (6,5), which is the apple's position. So total moves would be:

From (0,5) → move right 6 times: steps 2-7.

Including step 1, that's 7 moves in total.

Wait no—step 1 is down, then steps 2-7 are right moves (total of 6). Including the first step, it's 7 moves.

But maybe there's a more efficient path. Alternatively, perhaps moving up instead of down would be better if possible.

Alternatively, from (0,6), move up to (0,7), then right towards (6,7), but that's further away from the apple at (6,5). So probably not optimal.

So the most straightforward path is:

1. Down from (0,6) → (0,5).

2. Right 6 times: (1,5), (2,5), ..., (6,5).

Total of 7 moves.

I think that's a valid path.

To solve this problem, we need to navigate the snake from its initial position at (0, 6) to the target apple located at (6, 5) without colliding with any part of its own body. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right, but cannot overlap with itself except for the head.

### Approach
1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at position (0, 6) with its body extending horizontally to the right.
2. **Avoid Boundaries**: Moving left from (0, 6) is not possible as it would go out of bounds. Therefore, we consider moving down or up.
3. **Optimal Path**: To reach the target efficiently, moving down first to align vertically closer to the apple's y-coordinate (5) and then moving right towards the target x-coordinate (6) is optimal.

### Solution Code
```python
# Assuming a grid where movement is tracked step by step

def move_snake():
    # Initial position of head
    head = (0, 6)
    body = [(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6)]  # Including the head as the first element
    target = (6, 5)

    # Move down once
    new_head = (head[0], head[1] - 1)  # (0, 5)
    # Update body: each segment follows the previous one
    new_body = [(new_head[0], new_head[1])] + body[:-1]
    head, body = new_head, new_body

    # Move right until reaching target x-coordinate
    while head[0] < target[0]:
        new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
        new_body = [(new_head[0], new_head[1])] + body[:-1]
        head, body = new_head, new_body

    return "Successfully reached the target!"

# Call the function
print(move_snake())
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (0, 6) with its body extending from (1, 6) to (8, 6).
2. **First Move Down**: The head moves down from (0, 6) to (0, 5). The body segments adjust accordingly, shifting each part one step back.
3. **Subsequent Moves Right**: The snake continues moving right until the head reaches (6, 5), ensuring no overlap with its own body by updating each segment's position sequentially.

This approach ensures that the snake reaches the target in the minimum number of moves without colliding with itself.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6)], to eat the apple at (6, 5).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
