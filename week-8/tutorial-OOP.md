# Python OOP Tutorial: Mastering `self`, `cls`, `@classmethod`, Class Attributes, `@property`, and `object.__setattr__`

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm in Python that allows you to model real-world scenarios with classes and objects. This tutorial will guide you through some essential OOP concepts: `self`, `cls`, `@classmethod`, class attributes, `@property`, and `object.__setattr__`. We'll use a **Library Management System** as our real-world background to make these concepts easy to understand.

## Understanding `self`

In Python classes, `self` represents the instance of the class. It allows access to the attributes and methods of the class in Python. Using `self`, you can bind the attributes with the given arguments.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of `self` as **yourself** in a library. When you interact with the library system, you (the instance) perform actions like borrowing or returning books.

### Example

Let's create a `Book` class to understand `self`.

```python:src/library_system/book.py
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str):
        self.title = title  # Instance attribute
        self.author = author  # Instance attribute

    def description(self) -> str:
        """Returns a description of the book."""
        return f"'{self.title}' by {self.author}"
```

**Explanation:**

- `self.title` and `self.author` are **instance attributes** unique to each `Book` object.
- The `description` method uses `self` to access these attributes.

### Usage

```python
from library_system.book import Book

my_book = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
print(my_book.description())  # Output: '1984' by George Orwell
```

---

## `cls` and `@classmethod`

While `self` refers to the instance, `cls` refers to the **class itself**. `@classmethod` allows you to define methods that are bound to the class and not the instance.

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine the library has a **catalog system** that keeps track of all books. A class method can be used to create new entries in the catalog without needing a specific book instance.

### Example

Continuing with the `Book` class, let's add a class method to create a book from a dictionary.

```python:src/library_system/book.py
class Book:
    total_books = 0  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        Book.total_books += 1  # Incrementing class attribute

    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, data: dict) -> 'Book':
        """Creates a Book instance from a dictionary."""
        return cls(title=data['title'], author=data['author'])
```

**Explanation:**

- `total_books` is a **class attribute**, shared by all instances.
- `from_dict` is a **class method** that allows creating a `Book` instance from a dictionary without needing an existing object.

### Usage

```python
book_data = {"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee"}
new_book = Book.from_dict(book_data)
print(new_book.description())  # Output: 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee
print(Book.total_books)        # Output: 2
```

---

## Class Attributes vs. Instance Attributes

- **Class Attributes**: Shared across all instances of the class.
- **Instance Attributes**: Unique to each instance.

### Real-World Analogy

- **Class Attribute**: The library's total number of books.
- **Instance Attribute**: Details of each specific book.

### Example

```python:src/library_system/book.py
class Book:
    total_books = 0  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str):
        self.title = title  # Instance attribute
        self.author = author  # Instance attribute
        Book.total_books += 1
```

**Explanation:**

- `total_books` keeps track of how many `Book` instances have been created.
- Each `Book` has its own `title` and `author`.

### Usage

```python
book1 = Book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald")
book2 = Book("Moby Dick", "Herman Melville")

print(Book.total_books)  # Output: 2
```

---

## `@property` Decorator

The `@property` decorator allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to customize access to instance attributes.

### Real-World Analogy

Suppose you want to provide a **formatted version** of a book's title without storing it separately.

### Example

```python:src/library_system/book.py
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

    @property
    def uppercase_title(self) -> str:
        """Returns the title in uppercase."""
        return self.title.upper()
```

**Explanation:**

- `uppercase_title` is accessed like an attribute but is computed on the fly.

### Usage

```python
book = Book("Pride and Prejudice", "Jane Austen")
print(book.uppercase_title)  # Output: PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
```

### Setting Properties

You can also define setter methods using `@property`.

```python:src/library_system/book.py
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str):
        self._title = title  # Note the underscore
        self.author = author

    @property
    def title(self) -> str:
        """The title property."""
        return self._title

    @title.setter
    def title(self, new_title: str):
        if not new_title:
            raise ValueError("Title cannot be empty.")
        self._title = new_title
```

**Explanation:**

- Using `@title.setter`, you can control how the `title` attribute is modified.

### Usage

```python
book = Book("The Catcher in the Rye", "J.D. Salinger")
print(book.title)  # Output: The Catcher in the Rye

book.title = "The Grapes of Wrath"  # Valid update
print(book.title)  # Output: The Grapes of Wrath

book.title = ""  # Raises ValueError: Title cannot be empty.
```

## `object.__setattr__` Method

The `object.__setattr__` method allows you to set an attribute on an object bypassing `__setattr__`. It's commonly used in immutable classes or when you need to set attributes in a controlled manner.

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine trying to **override** certain rules in the library system, such as setting a book's title only once and preventing future changes.

### Example

Let's create an immutable `Book` class where attributes can only be set once.

```python:src/library_system/book.py
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str):
        object.__setattr__(self, 'title', title)
        object.__setattr__(self, 'author', author)

    def __setattr__(self, key, value):
        raise AttributeError("Cannot modify immutable Book instance.")
```

**Explanation:**

- `object.__setattr__` is used to set attributes during initialization.
- Overriding `__setattr__` prevents modification after creation.

### Usage

```python
book = Book("War and Peace", "Leo Tolstoy")
print(book.title)  # Output: War and Peace

book.title = "Anna Karenina"  # Raises AttributeError: Cannot modify immutable Book instance.
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use `self` for Instance Attributes and Methods**: Always use `self` to access or modify instance attributes within methods.

    ```python
    def update_title(self, new_title: str):
        self.title = new_title
    ```

2. **Use `cls` for Class Methods**: When defining methods that affect the class as a whole (like factory methods), use `@classmethod` and `cls`.

    ```python
    @classmethod
    def create_anonymous_book(cls):
        return cls("Unknown Title", "Unknown Author")
    ```

3. **Differentiate Class and Instance Attributes**: Use class attributes for data shared across all instances and instance attributes for data unique to each instance.

    ```python
    class Library:
        total_books = 0  # Class attribute
    ```

4. **Encapsulate Data with `@property`**: Use properties to control access to sensitive or computed attributes.

    ```python
    @property
    def author(self) -> str:
        return self._author
    ```

5. **Prefer Explicit Attribute Setting**: Use `object.__setattr__` sparingly, typically in immutable classes or special cases, to maintain control over attribute assignments.

6. **Use `Self` for Type Hinting**: Starting from Python 3.11, you can use `Self` from `typing` for more accurate type hints, especially in class methods.

    ```python
    from typing import Self

    @classmethod
    def from_title(cls, title: str) -> Self:
        return cls(title, "Unknown Author")
    ```

## Complete Example

Let's put everything together in a simple Library Management System.

```python:src/library_system/library.py
from typing import List, Self
from library_system.book import Book

class Library:
    total_books = 0  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.books: List[Book] = []

    @classmethod
    def from_catalog(cls, name: str, book_data: List[dict]) -> Self:
        """Creates a Library instance from a list of book dictionaries."""
        library = cls(name)
        for data in book_data:
            book = Book.from_dict(data)
            library.add_book(book)
        return library

    def add_book(self, book: Book) -> None:
        """Adds a book to the library."""
        self.books.append(book)
        Library.total_books += 1

    @property
    def book_count(self) -> int:
        """Returns the number of books in the library."""
        return len(self.books)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"Library '{self.name}' with {self.book_count} books."

    def __setattr__(self, key, value):
        if key == "name" and not value:
            raise ValueError("Library name cannot be empty.")
        super().__setattr__(key, value)
```

```python:src/library_system/book.py
from typing import Any, Mapping, Self
from library_system.library import Library

class Book:
    total_books = 0  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, title: str, author: str):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        Book.total_books += 1

    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, data: Mapping[str, Any]) -> Self:
        """Creates a Book instance from a dictionary."""
        return cls(title=data['title'], author=data['author'])

    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        """Returns a description of the book."""
        return f"'{self.title}' by {self.author}"

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return self.description
```

### Usage

```python
from library_system.library import Library
from library_system.book import Book

# Creating books using classmethod
book1 = Book.from_dict({"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell"})
book2 = Book.from_dict({"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee"})

# Creating a library and adding books
my_library = Library("Central Library")
my_library.add_book(book1)
my_library.add_book(book2)

print(my_library)  # Output: Library 'Central Library' with 2 books.

# Creating library from catalog
catalog = [
    {"title": "The Great Gatsby", "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"},
    {"title": "Moby Dick", "author": "Herman Melville"}
]

new_library = Library.from_catalog("Downtown Library", catalog)
print(new_library)  # Output: Library 'Downtown Library' with 2 books.

# Accessing class attributes
print(Book.total_books)      # Output: 4
print(Library.total_books)   # Output: 4
```
