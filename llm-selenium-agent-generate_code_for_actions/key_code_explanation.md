# Key Code Explanation

```python
exec(full_code, globals(), local_vars)
```

### 1. What is `exec`?

- `exec()` is a built-in Python function that **executes dynamically generated Python code**.
- The code can be a string or a code object.
- It is often used when you want to run code that is generated at runtime, or loaded from an external source (like an LLM, a file, or user input).

**Example:**
```python
code = "print('Hello, world!')"
exec(code)  # This will print: Hello, world!
```

### 2. What are `globals()` and `local_vars`?

#### `globals()`
- `globals()` is a built-in function that returns a dictionary representing the **current global symbol table**.
- The global symbol table contains all global variables and functions for the current module.
- When you pass `globals()` to `exec`, any variables or functions defined in the executed code will be available globally (unless shadowed by locals).

#### `local_vars`
- This is a user-defined dictionary (in your code, it's `local_vars = {"self": self}`).
- It acts as the **local namespace** for the executed code.
- Any variables created or modified in the executed code will be stored in this dictionary, unless they are explicitly global.

### 3. How does `exec(full_code, globals(), local_vars)` work?

- `full_code`: The string of Python code you want to execute.
- `globals()`: The global namespace (variables/functions accessible everywhere in the module).
- `local_vars`: The local namespace (variables/functions accessible only within the executed code).

**What happens:**
- The code in `full_code` is executed as if it were part of the current Python program.
- It can access global variables/functions (from `globals()`).
- It can also access and modify variables in `local_vars`.
- If the code defines new variables, they will be added to `local_vars` (unless declared global).

---

### 4. Why use both `globals()` and `local_vars`?

- **Separation of namespaces:**  
  - Using both allows you to control what the executed code can access and where its variables go.
  - You can inject specific objects (like `self`) into the local namespace for the executed code to use.
- **Security and isolation:**  
  - By controlling the local namespace, you can limit what the executed code can do or see.

---

### 5. Example

```python
local_vars = {"x": 10}
exec("y = x + 5", globals(), local_vars)
print(local_vars["y"])  # Output: 15
```
- Here, `x` is provided to the executed code, and `y` is created in `local_vars`.

---

### 6. In your code

```python
exec(full_code, globals(), local_vars)
```
- `full_code` is the code generated by the LLM.
- `globals()` gives access to global functions and variables.
- `local_vars` contains at least `self`, so the executed code can use `self` to access the class instance and its methods/attributes.

### **Summary Table**

| Parameter      | What it is                | Purpose in `exec`                      |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `full_code`    | String of Python code     | The code to execute                    |
| `globals()`    | Global namespace dict     | Access to global variables/functions   |
| `local_vars`   | Local namespace dict      | Where local variables are stored       |

**Caution:**  
- `exec` is powerful but dangerous if used with untrusted code, as it can execute arbitrary Python code and potentially harm your system.
