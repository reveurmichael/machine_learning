{"moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "To avoid colliding with its own body, the snake starts by moving left to decrease its length on the right side and create space for maneuvering towards the target. After a few left moves, it starts moving downward to decrease the y-coordinate towards the target position (0,2). Alternate between moving left and down as needed to safely navigate towards the target without colliding with its body."}
