========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

 {
    "moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
    "reasoning": "The snake moves first towards the apple, reducing Manhattan distance by 3 vertically and 6 horizontally (#DOWN - #UP = 3, #LEFT - #RIGHT = 6). This move sequence avoids collisions as it doesn't reverse direction on the first move or hug walls unnecessarily. The snake will not get trapped since there is no immediate self-collision and after eating the apple, a legal move remains next turn."
