Simple snake game.

NOTE: This represents our "vague idea" implementation - v0!
This shows how you can quickly prototype a working solution with basic Python.
We start simple with functions and global variables to get something working first.
In v1, we'll see how a little bit of OOP can help us organize and improve this foundation.
