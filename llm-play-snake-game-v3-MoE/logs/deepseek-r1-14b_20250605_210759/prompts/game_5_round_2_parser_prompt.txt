========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how the snake can get from (4,6) to the apple at (2,6). The current direction is "UP", and the body has one segment behind the head at (4,5).

First, I need to make sure that the initial moves don't cause any collisions. Since the head is moving up towards (4,7), but the apple is two units to the left at (2,6). Maybe moving left first would be a good idea to get closer to the apple.

But wait, can the snake move left on the first move? The current direction is "UP", so according to the rules, it cannot reverse. Reversing would mean going down if current direction is up, but left and right are allowed as long as they're not reversing. So moving left is okay since the opposite of UP isn't LEFT or RIGHT.

So the first move could be LEFT. Let's see where that takes us. The head moves from (4,6) to (3,6). Now, check for collisions: the new head is within bounds and doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail if it's about to move. But since we're moving left, which isn't opposite of UP, it should be safe.

After moving left, the body will update. The old head (4,6) becomes the first body segment, so now the body is [(3,6), (4,5)]. Wait, no, when you move, the body shifts. So after moving LEFT, the new head is at (3,6). The previous body was [(4,5)], and since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail. But wait, the initial state has only one body segment. So after moving left, the body becomes empty? Or does it add the old head to the front.

Wait, no: when you move, step 3a says insert the old head at the front of the BODY list. The initial BODY is [(4,5)]. After moving LEFT, new_head is (3,6). Then, we insert (4,6) into the front of the body list, making it [(4,6), (4,5)]. But then step 3c says to remove the tail unless eating an apple. So since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (4,5) is removed? Or does the tail only get removed if not growing.

Wait no: in the movement update rule, after inserting the old head into the front of the body list, if it's not an apple, you remove the last element. So initial body is [(4,5)]. After moving left:

BODY becomes [(4,6), (4,5)], then since new_head isn't the apple, we remove the tail: so BODY is now [(4,6)].

Wait no, wait the step says: "Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list." So original body was [(4,5)]. After moving left:

BODY becomes [ (4,6), (4,5) ] before any removal. Then since it's not an apple, we remove the last element: so BODY becomes [ (4,6) ].

So after moving LEFT once, the head is at (3,6), and the body is [(4,6)]. That seems okay because (4,6) is adjacent to (3,6), which is correct as per the snake's continuity.

Now, after the first move, the direction changes from "UP" to "LEFT", but wait no—the movement direction is chosen each step. So in this case, I'm choosing LEFT for the first move. Next, what should be the next moves?

The apple is at (2,6), so we need to get two units left from 4,6. After moving once to (3,6), another LEFT would take us to (2,6). But let's check if that's safe.

After moving to (3,6), the body is [(4,6)]. So moving again to LEFT would be (2,6). Check collision: new_head is (2,6). Is this colliding with any BODY segments except the tail?

In this case, the body after first move is [(4,6)], so (2,6) doesn't collide. So moving another LEFT would take us to (2,6), which is the apple.

Wait, but in that case, when we eat the apple, the body grows by one segment and doesn't remove the tail. Let's think about this:

After eating the apple at (2,6):

- new_head = (2,6)
- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head into front of body: [(3,6), (4,6)]
- Since new_head == apple, we don't remove the tail. So body becomes [(3,6), (4,6)]

Wait no—step 3b says if new_head is apple, grow by not removing the tail. So initial body after moving left once was [ (4,6) ], but when eating the apple:

After moving LEFT to (2,6):

- Insert old head (3,6) into front: body becomes [ (3,6), (4,6) ]
- Since we ate the apple, do not remove tail.

So now, the new S is [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ] as the full snake. The head is at (2,6), which is where the apple was.

But wait, after eating, we must ensure that there's at least one legal move next turn to avoid trapping. So after eating, the body is longer, but let's see if the next move can be made.

But in this scenario, we have only two moves: LEFT and then LEFT again. But since the first move was LEFT (from UP direction), which is allowed as it's not reversing.

So the sequence would be ["LEFT", "LEFT"], leading to eating the apple.

Wait, but let me double-check:

Initial state:
- Head: (4,6)
- Direction: UP
- Body: [(4,5)]
- Apple: (2,6)

First move: LEFT → new head (3,6). Body after movement: [ (4,6) ]

Second move: LEFT again. Now, the direction is now LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT.

New head would be (2,6), which is the apple's position. So yes, it's a valid path.

But wait, let me check for any collisions when moving into (2,6). The body after first move is [ (4,6) ], and new_head (3,6) is safe. Then moving again to LEFT: (2,6).

Now, in the second move:

- Compute new_head: (2,6)
- Check collision: within bounds? Yes.
- AnyBODYi except the tail when it moves? The body is [ (4,6) ], so no.

Thus, it's safe. So moving LEFT twice would reach the apple without any issues.

But wait another thing: When you eat the apple, the body grows by one segment. So after eating, the body becomes [ (3,6), (4,6) ] because we didn't remove the tail.

Wait no, step 3b says that when new_head is apple, grow and do not remove the tail. So in the second move, which is eating the apple:

After inserting old head into front: [ (3,6), (4,6) ]

But since it's an apple, we don't remove anything. So body becomes [ (3,6), (4,6) ].

So full snake is [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)].

Now, for the next move after eating, we have to ensure there's at least one legal move. But since the problem only asks up to eating the apple, perhaps that's sufficient.

Wait, no—the problem says the objective is to plan a path where the head reaches the apple. So in this case, two moves would suffice: LEFT and then LEFT again.

But wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. The initial direction is UP, so when moving LEFT first time, that's allowed because it's not reversing. Then for the second move, can we choose LEFT again?

Yes, because the current direction is now LEFT after the first move, and we can't reverse (i.e., cannot go RIGHT). So as long as we're not choosing opposite directions.

But wait, in this case, after moving LEFT once, the next move is also LEFT—so no reversal. That's allowed.

So yes, two LEFT moves would bring us to the apple safely.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (4, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(4, 5)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (2, 6). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
