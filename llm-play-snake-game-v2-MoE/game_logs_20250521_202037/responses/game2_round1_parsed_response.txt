{"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "To avoid collisions with the snake's own body, we move the snake LEFT four times to decrease the x-coordinate and keep the y-coordinate constant. After reaching (1,5), we move DOWN three times to decrease the y-coordinate and reach the apple at (1,2). This ensures that the snake does not cross its own body during movement."}
