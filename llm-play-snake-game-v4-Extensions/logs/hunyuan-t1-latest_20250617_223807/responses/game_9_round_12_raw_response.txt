{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move up 4 units and left 8 units to reach the apple. Starting with UP moves avoids immediate collision and aligns with the apple's vertical position. Moving LEFT afterward navigates horizontally while the body shifts safely. A final DOWN move adjusts to the apple's y-coordinate. All intermediate positions avoid body collisions, and after eating, there are safe moves remaining."
