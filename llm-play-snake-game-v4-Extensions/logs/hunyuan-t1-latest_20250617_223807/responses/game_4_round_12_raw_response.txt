========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 3 times to align with the apple's x-coordinate (8) and up 8 times to reach the apple's y-coordinate (9). Initial moves right avoid body segments (which are above the head initially) and stay within bounds. Subsequent up moves follow a clear path as the body shifts downward, leaving the upward path unobstructed. After reaching the apple, the snake can safely move left or right, avoiding self-collision."
