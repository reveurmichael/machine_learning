 {
    "moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN"],
    "reasoning": "The snake can move one step to the right (5->6) and then downwards (6->7), reaching the apple at (4,6). This path avoids collisions since the head will not move outside the grid bounds or into occupied cells. Additionally, this path ensures that after eating the apple, the snake has a legal move next turn (upwards to (3,7))."
