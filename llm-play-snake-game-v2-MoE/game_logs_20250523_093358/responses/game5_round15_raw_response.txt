========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the current game state to find a safe path for the snake's head to reach the apple.

Here are the given inputs:
- Head position: (9, 6)
- Current direction: DOWN
- Body cells: [(9, 7)]
- Apple position: (9, 1)

Since we're starting from (9, 6) and moving towards (9, 1), let's think through this step-by-step:

1. We can't reverse direction on the first move because the current direction is DOWN.
2. We need to make sure that after each move, we avoid collisions with walls or body parts.
3. The goal is to get from (9, 6) to (9, 1), which means we'll need to go down multiple times.

Let's plan our moves:
- Since the head is at (9, 6) and the apple is at (9, 1), we should move DOWN directly.

Now let's implement this in JSON format:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move down directly to reach the apple at (9, 1) from (9, 6)."
}
```

I'll provide this as a valid JSON object:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move down directly to reach the apple at (9, 1) from (9, 6)."
}
```
This is the optimal path since we're already aligned horizontally with the apple and just need to move downward.
