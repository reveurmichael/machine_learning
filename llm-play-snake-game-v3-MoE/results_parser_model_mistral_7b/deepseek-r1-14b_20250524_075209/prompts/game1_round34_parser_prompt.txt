<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (9,8) to eat the apple at (6,8). Let's break this down step by step.

First, the head is at (9,8), and the current direction is "UP". The body cells are [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. So the snake is moving upwards from the tail. Wait, no—the body list starts immediately behind the head, so the first cell after the head is (9,7). Then it goes to (8,7), which means the snake is turning left and then down? Hmm, not sure about that yet.

The apple is at (6,8), which is three cells to the left of the head. So in terms of movement, I need the head to move left three times. But wait, the direction is currently "UP", so the next move can't be "DOWN" because you can't reverse direction immediately. So from UP, allowed moves are LEFT or RIGHT or UP again? Wait no, the rule says you cannot reverse. If current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN next. But can you choose UP again?

Wait, looking back at the movement rules: "Cannot reverse": if current direction is UP, may not choose DOWN next. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So from UP, allowed directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT? Or wait, maybe the initial move after NONE allows any, but here the current direction is UP. So in this case, possible moves are UP (same direction), LEFT, or RIGHT, but not DOWN.

So starting at (9,8) moving UP. Wait, what's the position of the body cells? Let me visualize the grid.

The snake's head is at (9,8). The body is [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. So after the head comes (9,7), which is directly below. Then (8,7) is to the left of that, so moving left from (9,7) to (8,7). Then down to (8,6), then further down to (8,5). Wait no, because each body part must be adjacent to the previous. So from (8,7) to (8,6) is down, and then to (8,5) is another down.

Wait, so the snake's path is: head at 9,8 → body1 at 9,7 (down) → body2 at 8,7 (left) → body3 at 8,6 (down) → body4 at 8,5 (down). So it's a bit of a meandering path.

Now, the apple is at (6,8), which is three cells to the left. The head is currently moving UP, but since the next move can't be DOWN, we have to consider moving LEFT, UP, or RIGHT.

But let's see: if the snake moves LEFT from (9,8), that would take it to (8,8). But does that collide with any body parts? Let me check. The body starts at (9,7), which is below, so (8,8) isn't part of the body yet. So that's safe.

But wait, after moving LEFT, the head becomes (8,8), and then we need to see how the body updates. But before that, let's plan the path.

The apple is at (6,8). The straight line from 9,8 would be three LEFT moves: LEFT, LEFT, LEFT. That's the shortest path, but considering the snake's current body, can we do that?

Wait, after moving LEFT once to (8,8), let's see what happens next.

But wait, the body will shift each time, except if eating an apple. So when moving towards the apple, if we don't eat it yet, the tail moves as well, so we have to make sure that the path doesn't get blocked by the body after each move.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to plan a U-turn or find another way since the initial direction is UP and the body might block some paths.

Wait, looking at the current body, from (9,7) down, then left, then down. So the snake is currently moving in a downward-left path.

If I want to move LEFT first, to (8,8), that should be okay because none of the body parts are there yet. Then next move, can we go LEFT again? But after the first LEFT, the direction would change, so from UP to LEFT—allowed since you can't reverse, but moving LEFT is allowed.

Wait no, in the movement rules: when current direction is "UP", you cannot choose "DOWN" as the next move. So choosing LEFT or RIGHT or UP is okay. But if we choose LEFT first, then the new direction becomes LEFT for the next moves, which would allow us to make more LEFTs without reversing.

So perhaps the optimal path is:

1. Move LEFT: (9,8) → (8,8)
2. Move LEFT: (8,8) → (7,8)
3. Move LEFT: (7,8) → (6,8), eating the apple.

But wait, let's check each step for collisions and body updates.

First move:

Current head is (9,8), direction is UP.

Move LEFT to (8,8). Check collision:

- new_head is within grid.
- Does (8,8) collide with any BODYi except possibly the tail when it moves?

The body cells are [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. So none of these are at (8,8). Safe.

Then update the body:

a. Insert old head (9,8) to front → BODY becomes [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)].
b. Since new_head is not apple yet (apple is at 6,8), so remove tail: new body is [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6)].

So the snake's head is now (8,8), direction LEFT.

Second move:

Current head is (8,8), direction LEFT.

Move LEFT again to (7,8). Check collision:

- new_head is within grid.
- Does (7,8) collide with any BODYi except possibly the tail?

Body after first move is [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6)]. So no collision.

Update body:

a. Insert old head (8,8) → body becomes [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6)].
b. new_head not apple, so remove tail: body is [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)].

Third move:

Current head is (7,8), direction LEFT.

Move LEFT to (6,8). Check collision:

- new_head is within grid.
- apple is at (6,8), so check if any body parts are there except the tail. Before moving, the body is [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]. So no, because the tail is still at (8,7).

Wait, when we move to (6,8), which is the apple's position.

So after the move:

a. Insert old head (7,8) → body becomes [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)].
b. Since new_head == apple, grow by not removing tail: body becomes [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)].

So the snake's head is now at (6,8), and it has eaten the apple. Now we need to ensure that after this move, there is at least one legal next move.

What direction will the snake be moving after eating the apple? The last move was LEFT, so current direction is LEFT. Next, can't choose RIGHT because you can't reverse (since last direction is LEFT, you can't go RIGHT). So allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

Looking at the new body:

After eating, the snake's body is [(6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]. Wait no: when you eat the apple, the body grows. So after moving to (6,8) and eating, the body becomes:

- Insert old head (7,8) at front → [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]
- Since it's apple, don't remove tail. So body is now [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait no: the head is new_head, and then the old body parts are added.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

The full snake after each move:

After first move (LEFT):

Head: (8,8)
Body: [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6)] → no, wait, in the initial step, body was [ (9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5) ]. After inserting old head (9,8), it becomes [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6)]. Then, since not eating apple, remove tail → body is [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ].

Wait no, the body cells are given as a list from head to tail. So initial body is [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. After moving LEFT, inserting old head (9,8) at front: [(9,8)] + [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. But since new_head is not apple, remove tail → so body becomes [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6)].

Wait no, wait the process:

After moving to new head, you insert old head to front of the body list. Then, if it's an apple move, keep all; else, remove tail.

So initial move LEFT:

new_head: (8,8)
old_body = [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]
insert old_head (9,8) to front → new_body_before_shift = [ (9,8) ] + old_body → [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5) ]
then, since not apple, remove tail: [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6) ]

So after first move:

head: 8,8

body: 9,8 → 9,7 → 8,7 → 8,6.

Second move: LEFT to 7,8.

new_head:7,8
old_body: [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6) ]
insert old head (8,8) at front → [ (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6) ]
since not apple, remove tail: [ (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]

Third move: LEFT to 6,8.

new_head:6,8
old_body: [ (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]
insert old head (7,8) at front → [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]
since it's apple, do not remove tail. So body becomes [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]? Wait no: the head is now 6,8, and the body after inserting old_head would be [ (7,8) ] + [ (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ].

But wait, the new_head is (6,8). The process is:

After moving to (6,8):

1. Insert old head (7,8) to front of body → [ (7,8) ] + [ (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]
2. Since it's apple, keep all: so the new body is [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]

Wait no, the full snake after eating would be:

head: 6,8

body parts: [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]

So now, after eating, when planning next move, we need to ensure that moving in any direction except RIGHT is possible (since last direction was LEFT, can't reverse).

But let's check if the new body positions block any directions.

After eating, the head is at 6,8. The body behind is 7,8; 8,8; etc.

So if we move UP next:

new_head would be 6,9, which is within grid. Does it collide with any body parts? Body is [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), ...]. So (6,9) is not in the body, so safe.

Similarly, moving DOWN to 6,7: check if 6,7 is in body? The body after move is [7,8; 8,8; etc.], so no.

Wait, but when you move, you have to make sure that new_head doesn't collide with any existing body parts except possibly the tail which moves.

So moving UP from (6,8) to (6,9):

- collision check: none of the body parts are at (6,9), since they're [7,8; 8,8; ...], so safe.

Alternatively, moving LEFT would take head out of grid, not allowed. Moving DOWN is possible but maybe unnecessary.

So after eating, we have options to move UP or DOWN without collision.

Thus, the initial plan of three LEFTs should work.

Wait, but let me check again:

After first LEFT: (8,8), body [9,8; 9,7; 8,7]

Second LEFT: (7,8), body [8,8; 9,8; 9,7]

Third move to (6,8): eat apple.

So yes, that seems possible.

Wait but in the second step:

After moving LEFT to (7,8):

- new_head is (7,8)
- insert old head (8,8) → body becomes [ (8,8), 9,8; 9,7; 8,7]
- then remove tail because not apple: body is [ (8,8), 9,8; 9,7; 8,7 ]

Wait no, wait initial body after first move was [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ].

Then moving LEFT to (7,8):

- new_head = (7,8)
- insert old head (8,8) → new_body_before_shift: [ (8,8), 9,8; 9,7; 8,7]
- since not apple, remove tail → body is [ (8,8), 9,8; 9,7 ]

Wait that can't be right because we have four body segments initially.

Wait maybe I'm miscalculating the number of body segments. Initially, there are four body cells: [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. So when moving LEFT:

First move:

- head moves to (8,8)
- insert old_head (9,8) → new_body_before_shift is [ (9,8) ] + initial_body = [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5) ]
- since not apple, remove last → body becomes [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6) ]

So after first move:

body is four cells: [9,8; 9,7; 8,7; 8,6]

Second move:

- head moves to (7,8)
- insert old_head (8,8) → new_body_before_shift = [ (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6) ]
- not apple, remove last → body becomes [ (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]

Third move:

- head moves to (6,8)
- insert old_head (7,8) → new_body_before_shift = [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]
- since it's apple, don't remove tail → body becomes [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]

So after eating the apple, the snake is longer by one cell.

Thus, when planning next moves, we have to ensure that movement doesn't collide with the updated body.

But in this case, moving LEFT three times seems possible without collision.

Wait but what if after moving LEFT twice, the third move would cause a collision? Let me see:

After second move, head is (7,8), direction is LEFT. Next move to (6,8):

- new_head is (6,8)
- check collision: body parts are [ (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]
- none of these are at (6,8), so safe.

Thus, the three LEFT moves should work.

So the answer would be three LEFT moves. So the sequence is:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. LEFT

But wait, let me think again: after first move, direction changes to LEFT; so for subsequent moves, direction is LEFT unless changed.

Yes, because each move updates the current direction.

Alternatively, if we try moving UP once first, but that might complicate things.

Wait, initial direction is UP. Let's see what happens if I choose to move UP instead of LEFT initially.

Move 1: UP from (9,8) → (9,9). Check collision: body cells are [ (9,7), ... ], so no collision.

Then update body:

- insert old head (9,8) at front → [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5) ]
- not apple, remove tail → body becomes [ (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6) ]

So after move 1:

head:9,9

body:[9,8; 9,7; 8,7; 8,6]

Now, to reach apple at (6,8), I need to go LEFT multiple times.

But the direction is now UP. So next moves could be LEFT, but we'd have to change direction each time? Or can we just keep moving in the same direction?

Wait no: after each move, the direction changes based on the input command. So if you give a sequence of LEFTs, even if current direction is different.

Wait no, in reality, movement in grid-based games like Snake usually changes direction upon receiving a new direction command, unless it's the opposite direction which would cause collision and thus game over.

But for this problem, we can assume that the snake can change direction as long as it doesn't collide with itself.

So if after moving UP once to (9,9), then turning LEFT multiple times may not be optimal because the path could be blocked by the body.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a different route.

But perhaps the initial plan of three LEFTs is simpler and works without collision.

Thus, I think the answer is three LEFT moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the sequence of movements for a snake to reach a target position while avoiding collisions with its own body. The snake starts at position (9,8) and needs to move to (6,8). Each movement can be in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.

### Approach
1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (9,8), and the body extends from (9,7) to (8,5).
2. **Target Position**: The target position for the snake's head is (6,8).
3. **Movement Strategy**: To move left multiple times without colliding with its body, we can direct the snake to move left three times. This strategy works because moving left from the starting point will not cause any self-collisions as long as the path remains clear.

### Solution Code
```python
# The solution is a sequence of three 'LEFT' moves.
# Each move changes the direction of the snake's head towards LEFT, allowing it to reach the target without collision.

moves = ['LEFT', 'LEFT', 'LEFT']
```

### Explanation
1. **First Move**: Moving LEFT from (9,8) takes the head to (8,8). The body adjusts accordingly, and no collision occurs.
2. **Second Move**: Another LEFT move takes the head to (7,8). Again, the body shifts without any collisions.
3. **Third Move**: A final LEFT move takes the head to (6,8), which is the target position.

By following this sequence of three LEFT moves, the snake successfully reaches the target position without colliding with its own body.
