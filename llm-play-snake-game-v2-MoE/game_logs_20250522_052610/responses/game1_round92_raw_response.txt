========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to plan a safe path for the snake's head starting at (7,1) to reach the apple at (5,4). I need to consider all movement rules and constraints.

First, let's understand the current state:

- **Head Position**: (7,1)
- **Direction**: RIGHT
- **Body Cells**: [(2,7), (3,7), ..., (6,1)] — These are the body segments excluding the head.
- **Apple Position**: (5,4)

### Movement Constraints:
1. The snake cannot reverse direction immediately. Since it's currently moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.
2. The snake must not collide with its body after each move.
3. After eating the apple, there should still be at least one legal move to avoid trapping itself.

### Objective Analysis:
From (7,1) to (5,4), we need a total change of x: -2 (since 7-5=2) and y: +3 (since 4-1=3). So, the number of LEFT moves must exceed RIGHT by 2, and UP must exceed DOWN by 3.

### Initial Plan:
The head is at (7,1), moving RIGHT. The apple is to the left (x decreases) and up (y increases). Since it's currently moving right, the next move can't be LEFT. So, possible moves are UP or RIGHT, but since we need to go left overall, maybe planning a path that first goes up as much as needed and then turns left.

But wait, moving up from (7,1) would take it towards higher y-values. Let's see the body cells: they're along x=6, varying y from 2 down to 1. So if the head moves up, will it collide with any part of its body?

The body is at x=6, so if the head moves up, say to (7,2), that's clear because the body starts at (6,7) and goes down to (6,2). So moving up should be safe.

Wait, but let me check the exact positions. The body cells include (6,1), which is directly below (7,1). If the head moves RIGHT again, it would go to (8,1), but that's not towards the apple. Alternatively, if it turns UP, moving to (7,2) seems possible.

But wait, the direction is currently RIGHT. The next move can't be LEFT because of rule 3. So from RIGHT, we can't turn LEFT immediately. Therefore, the first move must be either UP or RIGHT or DOWN? Wait no: movement can change, but not reversing. Since current direction is RIGHT, next moves cannot be LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.

Wait, but moving DOWN would take the head to (7,0), which might lead into a collision with the body if it's there. Let's check the body cells: the last cell is (6,1). So (7,0) is outside the body. Wait, no, because the body includes x=6 down to 2, but y is from 7 down to 1.

So moving DOWN from (7,1) would take it to (7,0), which is safe as per current positions.

But let's think about the path towards the apple at (5,4). The head needs to decrease x by 2 and increase y by 3. So perhaps a combination of moving up first and then left.

But given that from RIGHT direction, we can't go LEFT on the first move, so maybe plan to make some moves upwards first to get out of the way of the body, then turn left when possible.

Alternatively, considering that after each move, the body shifts. So if the head moves up, the body will follow, but I need to ensure that none of the subsequent positions collide with the body.

Let's try mapping a possible path:

1. Move UP from (7,1) to (7,2). Now, the new head is at (7,2), and the body shifts, so the previous head (7,1) becomes part of the body. So the body now includes all previous cells plus (7,1).

Wait, no: when the snake moves, the head moves, then each body segment follows. So after moving UP, the new head is at (7,2), and the tail remains unless the apple is eaten.

But in this case, we're not eating yet. So the body will shift, meaning the previous positions are now part of the body except for the first one.

Wait, perhaps it's better to visualize:

Current body cells: [(2,7), (3,7), ..., (6,1)]. The head is at (7,1). When moving UP, new head is (7,2). Then the body segments move towards the previous head. So after this move, the body becomes [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (7,1)], making a longer chain.

Wait no: the body cells list given excludes the head. So when the snake moves, the new position is added as the new head, and all body segments follow. So if we have 10 body cells plus the head, that's a total length of 11 segments (but in this case, the body has 11 cells? Wait no: the body cells list has 11 elements, including from (2,7) down to (6,1). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the snake's movement step by step.

Let me try planning a path:

Start at (7,1), direction RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

Option 1: Move UP first to get out of the way.

Move 1: UP → (7,2). Now, check for collision with body. The body was [(2,7), ..., (6,1)], so (7,2) is not in the body. Safe.

Now direction is now NONE because we moved from RIGHT to UP, which is allowed as it's not reversing.

Next move: can go any direction except opposite of current direction (UP). Wait no: after moving UP, the new direction is UP, so next moves can't be DOWN.

Wait, no: according to movement rules, direction cannot reverse. So if current direction is RIGHT and you change to UP, that's allowed. Then from UP, next move can't be DOWN.

So let's plan:

1. Move UP → (7,2)
2. Now, direction is UP. Next moves can't be DOWN.
3. From (7,2), we need to decrease x by 2 and y by something? Wait no: the apple is at (5,4). So from (7,2), we need to go left by 2 and up by 2.

But let's see:

After moving UP, we can't move DOWN next. But perhaps we can start moving LEFT now because direction is now NONE after first move? Wait no: the new direction is UP, so next moves can't be DOWN. So from UP, can't go DOWN. So from (7,2), we can move RIGHT, LEFT, or stay in UP.

But wait, movement rules say that the snake's direction changes with each move unless it's NONE? Or does it continue moving in the same direction until changed?

Wait, according to the movement rules:

- The current direction is given as RIGHT. So when you make a move, the new direction becomes that move, except for the NONE case.

But in this problem, the initial direction is RIGHT. When making a move, if it's not NONE, then the next direction must not be the opposite. So moving UP from RIGHT is allowed because it's not reversing.

So after first move to (7,2), direction becomes UP.

From there, the next moves can't be DOWN.

But we need to get to (5,4). From (7,2), perhaps moving LEFT twice and then UP once more?

Wait, let me check:

(7,2) → move LEFT to (6,2). Is this position safe? The body after first move would have the previous head at (7,1) added to the body. So body cells become [(3,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1)]?

Wait, I'm getting confused about how the body updates. Each time the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

In this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so after each move, the tail is removed.

So initial body cells: 11 elements, including from (2,7) down to (6,1). The head is at (7,1).

After moving UP to (7,2), the new body includes all previous body cells shifted one step forward towards the new head. So the tail (6,1) would be removed if not eating.

But wait, when you move, the snake's body follows: each segment moves into the position of the next segment. The head moves first, then each body part takes the place of the previous.

So after moving UP from (7,1) to (7,2), the new positions are:

Head: (7,2)

Body segments: [(2,7), (3,7), ..., (6,1)] become [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (7,1)]

But wait, that's not correct. Let me think again.

When moving UP from head (7,1) to (7,2):

- The new head is (7,2).
- Each body segment moves into the position of the next one.
So previous head (7,1) becomes part of the body.
The body cells after this move would be:

[(3,7), (4,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1)]

But that makes 11 segments, which is longer than before. Wait no: the initial body has 11 cells plus the head? Or is the body given as excluding the head?

Wait in the input, the body cells are a list of positions excluding the head. So the current length is 12 (head + 11 body). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

In any case, after moving UP to (7,2), the body will shift, and (7,1) becomes part of the body. So when considering collisions, we need to make sure that each new head position doesn't collide with any existing body positions.

So back to planning:

Move 1: UP → (7,2). Safe because (7,2) is not in the original body cells.

Now, direction is UP.

Next move can't be DOWN.

We need to get to (5,4). From (7,2), that's x decrease by 2 and y increase by 2.

So perhaps:

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2). Check if this position is safe. The new body after first move includes (7,1) but not yet (6,2), so it should be safe.

Then move 3: UP to (6,3). Safe? Yes, because the body now is moving towards (7,2).

Wait no: after each move, the body shifts again. So let's simulate:

After Move 1: head at (7,2), body cells become [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1)].

Move 2: LEFT to (6,2). Now, check if (6,2) is in the new body. The body after first move includes (7,1), but not yet (6,2). So safe.

Now, direction is LEFT.

Body shifts again: previous head (7,2) becomes part of the body. So new body cells are [(4,7), ..., (7,1), (7,2)].

Move 3: UP to (6,3). Now check if (6,3) is in the body? The body after move 2 includes up to (7,2). No, so safe.

But wait, the apple is at (5,4), which is two more moves left and one up from here. But direction is now LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse direction? Wait no: current direction is LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, the movement rules state that you cannot reverse direction. So if you're moving LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. Similarly, moving UP means next can't be DOWN, etc.

So from (6,3), direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.

We need to go further left and up more.

Wait, perhaps this path isn't efficient. Maybe a better approach would be to find a way that allows the snake to reach the apple without getting stuck.

Alternative plan:

Move 1: UP → (7,2). Safe.

Now direction is UP.

Next move can't be DOWN.

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2). Safe.

Direction now LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT.

Move 3: UP to (6,3).

Now, direction is UP. Next move can't be DOWN.

Move 4: LEFT → (5,3). Check if safe. The body after each move shifts, but I think it's okay.

But from (5,3), we need to go up one more step to reach y=4.

So Move 5: UP → (5,4). Now, the head is at the apple's position.

After eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so tail remains. So now, after this move, there should be at least one legal move left.

But let's check the path:

Moves would be ["UP", "LEFT", "UP", "LEFT", "UP"] → but wait, that's five moves, and the final position is (5,4).

Wait no: from (7,1):

Move 1: UP to (7,2). Head direction now UP.

Move 2: LEFT to (6,2). Direction now LEFT.

Move 3: UP to (6,3). Direction now UP.

Move 4: LEFT to (5,3). Direction now LEFT.

Move 5: UP to (5,4). Now, direction is UP.

But let's check the direction changes:

From RIGHT → UP (allowed).

UP → LEFT (allowed; not reversing).

LEFT → UP (allowed).

UP → LEFT (allowed).

Wait no, that's a change from UP to LEFT, which isn't reversing. So it's allowed.

Now, after eating the apple, we need to ensure there's a way to move further without collision.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating; let me see if this path works.

Another alternative:

Move 1: UP → (7,2).

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2).

Move 3: LEFT → (5,2). Now direction is LEFT.

From here, need to go up twice.

But can't move RIGHT as it would reverse.

So next moves:

Move 4: UP → (5,3).

Move 5: UP → (5,4). Now at apple.

This seems similar.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path exists.

Wait, but I'm not sure if moving UP first is the best approach. Maybe moving RIGHT first would cause collision with body cells?

From (7,1), direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,1). Is this safe? The original body includes (2,7) to (6,1). So (8,1) isn't in the body; it's safe.

Now, direction is RIGHT.

Next move can't be LEFT.

But moving further right might not help. Alternatively, from (8,1), perhaps we can start moving UP.

Move 2: UP → (8,2).

And so on, but this seems longer.

Alternatively, let me think about the required movement.

The apple is at (5,4). So relative to starting point (7,1), need to move left twice and up three times.

But considering the snake's body is in a certain configuration, it might be easier to navigate around without getting stuck.

Another idea: After moving UP once, maybe turn right or left to avoid collision.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the initial plan of moving UP first and then LEFT twice and UP is feasible.

So let me try that:

Moves:

1. UP → (7,2)
2. LEFT → (6,2)
3. UP → (6,3)
4. LEFT → (5,3)
5. UP → (5,4)

But after the fifth move, direction would be UP. Now, we need to ensure that after eating the apple at (5,4), there's a way to move further.

Wait, no: upon reaching (5,4), which is the apple, the snake will grow, and then the next move must not cause collision with the new body.

But perhaps it's sufficient as long as we have a path after eating.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to plan a path that allows movement beyond.

Another approach: simulate each step carefully.

Initial position:

Head: (7,1)

Body cells: [(2,7), (3,7), ..., (6,1)]

So body is from x=2,y=7 down to x=6,y=1. So it's a vertical line on the left side of the grid, but decreasing y.

After moving UP to (7,2):

New head: (7,2)

Body cells now include the previous positions shifted:

The old head (7,1) is added, so body becomes [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1)]

Wait no: when you move UP, each body segment follows. So after moving UP once:

Head: (7,2)

Body: [previous_head(7,1)] + the rest? Or does it shift all segments?

Wait, perhaps each body part moves to the position of the next one.

So, initial body cells before any moves are from (2,7) down to (6,1). So after moving UP:

New head is (7,2).

Body becomes [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1)]

Because each segment follows the previous.

So now, body includes (7,1) as well.

Thus, when moving again from (7,2), we have to ensure that new positions don't collide with any of these.

Now, move 2: LEFT to (6,2). Check if (6,2) is in the current body. Current body after first move includes up to (7,1), so no collision.

Then, move 3: UP to (6,3). Again, check against new body:

After moving LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2):

New head: (6,2)

Body becomes [(4,7), ..., (7,1), (7,2)]

So when we move UP from (6,2) → (6,3):

Check if (6,3) is in the body. The body includes up to (7,2). So no collision.

Move 4: LEFT to (5,3). Check against new body:

After moving UP to (6,3):

New head: (6,3)

Body becomes [(5,7), ..., (7,1), (7,2), (6,2)]

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think that after each move, the body shifts one step towards the new head.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to visualize:

After each move, all body segments follow the path of the previous ones.

So after first move UP:

Body is from (3,7) to (6,1), plus new position (7,2).

Wait no: when you move UP from (7,1), the head becomes (7,2). The previous body cells are now shifted: each one moves into the next's position. So the first body cell (2,7) moves to (3,7), and so on.

Thus, after moving UP once:

Head: (7,2)

Body cells: [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1)]

Then moving LEFT from (7,2):

New head: (6,2)

Body cells shift again: each one moves into the next's position.

So previous body was [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1)].

After moving LEFT:

Head: (6,2)

Body becomes [(4,7), (5,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1), (7,2)]

So when considering the next move from (6,2) → (6,3):

Check if (6,3) is in the body. The body now includes up to (7,2). So no collision.

Proceeding:

Move 4: UP → (6,3)

Body becomes [(5,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2)]

Then move LEFT again to (5,3):

Check if safe. The body now includes up to (6,2). So yes, it's safe.

Move 4: LEFT → (5,3)

Body shifts: [(6,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3)]

Then move UP to (5,4):

Check if (5,4) is in the body. The body after move 4 includes up to (6,3). So no collision.

Thus, this path seems safe.

Now, let's count the moves:

1. UP → (7,2)
2. LEFT → (6,2)
3. UP → (6,3)
4. LEFT → (5,3)
5. UP → (5,4)

But after eating the apple at move 5, we need to ensure that there's a way to move further without collision.

Wait, but perhaps we don't need to worry about that since the question is just about reaching the apple, not necessarily moving beyond it. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the requirements.

Alternatively, maybe fewer moves are needed. Let me see if I can find a shorter path.

Is there a way to reach (5,4) in 4 moves?

From (7,1):

Move 1: UP → (7,2)

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2)

Move 3: UP → (6,3)

Move 4: LEFT → (5,3)

But then we need to move UP again to reach (5,4). So that's a fifth move.

Alternatively, is there a way to turn earlier?

Wait, perhaps from (7,2), after moving UP, I can move LEFT twice and UP once more.

Wait, but the direction changes would affect what moves are possible.

Another idea: Move 1: UP → (7,2)

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2)

Move 3: LEFT → (5,2)

Then from there, we need to go up three times. But wait:

After move 3: direction is LEFT. Next moves can't be RIGHT.

But to go up, you have to change direction to UP, which is allowed as it's not reversing.

So:

Move 4: UP → (5,3)

Move 5: UP → (5,4)

Same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps a different path where we don't move LEFT twice but instead alternate directions?

Wait, I'm starting to think that the minimal number of moves is five. So the answer would be ["UP", "LEFT", "UP", "LEFT", "UP"], or similar.

But let me check for possible shorter paths.

Is it possible to reach (5,4) in four moves? Let's see:

From (7,1):

Move 1: UP → (7,2)

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2)

Move 3: UP → (6,3)

Move 4: LEFT AND UP? No, each move is either direction.

Wait, no. Each move is one direction.

So four moves would be:

UP, LEFT, UP, LEFT or something else.

But that only gets us to (5,3). Then need a fifth move to reach (5,4).

Alternatively, perhaps using RIGHT somewhere could help, but initial direction is RIGHT, which might lead into the body.

Wait, from (7,1), moving RIGHT would go to (8,1). But then how?

From (8,1), you'd have to move UP multiple times. It's probably longer.

Thus, I think five moves are needed: UP, LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP.

But let me see if I can find a way with four moves by changing directions differently.

Wait, after moving UP once to (7,2), could we then move LEFT and then DOWN? But that would take us away from the apple.

No, probably not. We need to go left and up.

Alternatively, perhaps another sequence:

Move 1: UP → (7,2)

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2)

Move 3: UP → (6,3)

Move 4: LEFT AND UP? No, each move is one direction. So from (6,3), moving LEFT to (5,3) and then UP to (5,4). That's two moves.

Thus, total moves: five.

Alternatively, maybe another path:

Move 1: UP → (7,2)

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2)

Move 3: LEFT → (5,2)

Move 4: UP → (5,3)

Move 5: UP → (5,4)

Same as before.

So I think five moves are needed. Therefore, the sequence would be:

1. UP

2. LEFT

3. UP

4. LEFT

5. UP

But to confirm, let's visualize each step:

Initial position: Head at (7,1), body from (2,7) down to (6,1).

Move 1: UP → (7,2). Body becomes [(3,7), (4,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1)].

Move 2: LEFT → (6,2). Body shifts to [(4,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1), (7,2)].

Move 3: UP → (6,3). Body becomes [(5,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2)].

Move 4: LEFT → (5,3). Body shifts to [(6,7), ..., (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3)].

Move 5: UP → (5,4). Now at the apple. Body includes all previous positions up to (5,3).

This seems correct.
</think>

To reach the apple located at position (5,4) from the initial head position (7,1), follow these steps:

1. Move Up to (7,2)
2. Move Left to (6,2)
3. Move Up to (6,3)
4. Move Left to (5,3)
5. Move Up to (5,4)

The sequence of moves is: UP, LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP.

$\boxed{[\text{UP}, \text{LEFT}, \text{UP}, \text{LEFT}, \text{UP}]}$
