  "moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "We move down to (8,3) to avoid immediately moving up and potentially reversing direction. Then we move left to approach the apple from a safe distance. To maintain safety, we alternate between left and down moves until reaching the apple row before making an upward movement."
