========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 4 times and up 4 times to reach the apple at (1,8). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing direction and safely navigates past the initial body segment. Subsequent UP moves align with the apple's vertical position, and LEFT moves adjust horizontally. Each step avoids collisions with the body, and after eating the apple, there are legal moves remaining (e.g., LEFT, UP, DOWN) to prevent trapping."
