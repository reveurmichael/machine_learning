{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (5, 5) and moves four steps to the right, reaching (9, 5). Then it moves one step up, reaching (9, 6), where the apple is located. Since the snake's body consists of only one segment until it reaches the apple, there is no risk of colliding with itself along this route."}
