========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake's head is at (0,8) and the apple is at (1,8), which is directly to the right. The current direction is DOWN, so reversing (UP) is invalid, but RIGHT is allowed. Moving RIGHT to (1,8) reaches the apple without colliding with the body (all body segments are at y=9, above the head's new position). After eating, the body grows, and there are safe subsequent moves (e.g., DOWN or RIGHT), ensuring no immediate trapping."
