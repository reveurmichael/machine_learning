========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right along the bottom row (y=0) from (3,0) to (7,0). The initial direction is DOWN, so the first move cannot be UP. Moving RIGHT is safe as the bottom row (y=0) is clear of the snake's body (which occupies x=3, yâ‰¥1 and other areas above/below). Four RIGHT moves directly reach the apple at (7,0) without collisions, and the path avoids reversing direction or trapping the snake afterward."
