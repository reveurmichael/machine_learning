"""
Supervised Learning v0.01 - Neural Networks (PyTorch)
--------------------

First supervised learning extension focusing on neural networks using PyTorch.
Demonstrates the evolution from heuristic algorithms to learned policies.

Features:
- Neural network agents trained on heuristic data
- PyTorch-based implementation
- Multiple network architectures (MLP, CNN, RNN)
- Training and evaluation pipeline
- Comparison with heuristic baselines
- Extensive reuse of Task-0 base classes

This extension shows how supervised learning can learn from expert demonstrations
(heuristic algorithms) to create policies that generalize beyond the training data.
