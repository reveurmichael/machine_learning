You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (4,5), and the apple is at (3,5). The current direction is UP, and the body segments are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2)]. So the snake is moving upwards, and the body is in a line going down from the head. Wait, the head is at (4,5), then the body segments are (4,4), (4,3), etc. So the body is directly below the head, forming a vertical line. The apple is to the left of the head, at (3,5). 

First, the goal is to get the head to (3,5) without colliding. Let me think about the path. The head is at (4,5), and the apple is at (3,5), which is one step to the left. But the current direction is UP, so the first move can't be DOWN. But the head is moving up, so the next move can't be DOWN. But the apple is to the left. So maybe turning left first?

But wait, the snake's body is in a vertical line. If the snake moves left, the head would go to (3,5), which is the apple's position. But before that, I need to check if that's possible. Let me simulate that.

If the snake moves LEFT, then new_head is (4-1,5) = (3,5). Now, checking for collisions. The body cells are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2)]. The new head is at (3,5). Is (3,5) occupied by any body segments? The body segments are all in columns 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. So (3,5) isn't part of the body. Also, the new head is within the grid. So that seems safe. Then, since the apple is at (3,5), the snake would eat the apple. So the body would grow. 

But after eating the apple, the body length increases. Let me think about the next steps. After moving left to (3,5), the body would be updated. The original body was [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2)]. Then the new head is (3,5), and the body would be [old head (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2)] because the apple is eaten, so the tail isn't removed. Wait, the movement rule says that when eating the apple, the tail is not removed. So the body would be inserting the old head (4,5) into the front of the body list, and the tail remains. So the body becomes [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2)] and then the head is (3,5). So the new snake is head (3,5), followed by those body segments. 

Now, after eating the apple, the next move must be possible. The next move can't be in a direction that would cause the snake to collide with itself. Let's check. Suppose the next move is UP again. The new head would be (3,6). Is that safe? Let's see. The body segments are (4,5), (4,4), etc. So (3,6) is not part of the body. So that's okay. Alternatively, moving right to (4,5) would take the head back to the old position, but that's the first body segment. But since the body is now longer, moving right would cause the head to collide with the first body segment (which is (4,5)). So that's not allowed. So after eating the apple, the snake must have at least one move available. So moving UP would be safe. 

Wait, but the initial move is LEFT to reach the apple. That seems possible. Let me check again. The head is at (4,5). Moving LEFT would take it to (3,5), which is the apple. So that's one move. But is there a collision? The body segments are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2)]. So the new head (3,5) is not in any of those positions. So yes, that's safe. 

But then, after eating the apple, the body is longer. So the next move has to be such that the snake doesn't die. But the problem only requires the moves to reach the apple. The apple is eaten in the first move. So the "moves" list would be ["LEFT"], and that's it. Wait, but the problem says "plan a safe path for the HEAD to reach the apple". So once the head reaches the apple, the moves are done. So in this case, moving left once would be sufficient. 

But wait, the initial direction is UP. So the first move can't be DOWN. But moving left is allowed. So the move is valid. 

But wait, is there a problem with the body after the move? Let me check again. The original body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2)]. When the head moves to (3,5), the body is updated by inserting the old head (4,5) at the front. Since the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed. So the new body is [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2)]. The head is (3,5). So the next body segments are (4,5), which is adjacent to the head (3,5) (difference in x is 1, y same). So that's okay. All body segments are adjacent. 

But the problem requires that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move. However, the problem's objective is to reach the apple. So once the apple is eaten, the task is done. So the moves list would be ["LEFT"]. 

But is that correct? Let me confirm. The apple is at (3,5), and the head moves there in one move. That's possible. So the answer is just one move left. But why is the initial direction UP? Well, the first move can't be DOWN, but moving left is allowed. 

But wait, the current direction is UP. So the snake is moving upwards. But the head is at (4,5), and the next move is LEFT. That's allowed. Because the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN, but LEFT is allowed. 

Yes. So the answer is ["LEFT"], and the reasoning is that moving left directly to the apple is safe as it doesn't collide with the body and is within the grid. 

But wait, let me check if the new head (3,5) is not in the body. The body segments after the move would be the old head (4,5) and the rest. So the new head is (3,5), which is not in the body. The body segments are (4,5), (4,4), etc. So yes. 

Therefore, the correct move is to go left once. So the JSON output should be {"moves": ["LEFT"], "reasoning": "Move left directly to the apple at (3,5), which is adjacent and not blocked by the body."}
</think>

{
"moves": ["LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly to the left of the head at (3,5). Moving left immediately reaches the apple without collision, as the body segments are positioned below the head and do not block this path."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (4, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)], to eat the apple at (3, 5).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
