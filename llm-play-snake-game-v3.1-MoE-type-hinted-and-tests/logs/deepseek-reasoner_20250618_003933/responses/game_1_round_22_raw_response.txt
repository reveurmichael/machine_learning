{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Moved right twice to position the head at (2,1), avoiding the body on the left column, then moved up five times along x=2 to reach the apple at (2,6). The path is safe, avoids collisions, and after eating, multiple moves (UP, LEFT, or RIGHT) are available to prevent trapping."
