========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 8 times and up 2 times to reach the apple at (1,9). Starting with UP avoids reversing direction and moves toward the apple's y-coordinate. Subsequent UP and LEFT moves navigate toward the target while avoiding collisions with the snake's body, which shifts safely as the tail is removed (since the apple isn't eaten until the final move)."
}
