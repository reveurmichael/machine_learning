00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,040
check this out I'll push all these Kings
into the deck and because they're

34
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,050
into the deck and because they're
 

35
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,810
into the deck and because they're
inseparable if I just give the deck a

36
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:44,820
inseparable if I just give the deck a
 

37
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,260

quick cut like this and look through the

38
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,270
quick cut like this and look through the
 

39
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,549
quick cut like this and look through the
deck we'll see that all four kings are

40
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
deck we'll see that all four kings are
 

41
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,270
deck we'll see that all four kings are
now right next to each other and that is

42
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
now right next to each other and that is
 

43
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,400

the four king card trick now in order to

44
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,410
the four king card trick now in order to
 

45
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,750
the four king card trick now in order to
do this trick of course we're gonna need

46
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760

47
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,799
do this trick of course we're gonna need
the four kings

48
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:00,809
the four kings
 

49
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,380
the four kings
so we're start off with the four kings

50
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,390
so we're start off with the four kings
 

51
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,600
so we're start off with the four kings
and we're also going to need two random

52
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:05,610
and we're also going to need two random
 

53
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,580
and we're also going to need two random
cards so I'll just take - unfortunately

54
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:07,590
cards so I'll just take - unfortunately
 

55
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,710
cards so I'll just take - unfortunately
deck now let's just say these are the

56
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:09,720
deck now let's just say these are the
 

57
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,750
deck now let's just say these are the
two random cards now I like to start off

58
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
two random cards now I like to start off
 

59
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,910
two random cards now I like to start off
by having the two lanham cards right in

60
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
by having the two lanham cards right in
 

61
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,760
by having the two lanham cards right in
the center of all the Kings so two Kings

62
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:16,770
the center of all the Kings so two Kings

in my performance I took the deck said I

88
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:54,700
in my performance I took the deck said I
 

89
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,149

two three and four now of course this is
 

93
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,120
two three and four now of course this is
a lot easier if you don't have a deck in

94
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,130
a lot easier if you don't have a deck in
 

95
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,749
a lot easier if you don't have a deck in
your hand but for my purposes we'll just

and discard just put them up like this

104
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:17,319
and discard just put them up like this
 

105
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,180
and discard just put them up like this
and put them right in the back and turn

106
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,190
and put them right in the back and turn
 

107
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,309
and put them right in the back and turn
this whole packet over and you're pretty

108
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:23,319
this whole packet over and you're pretty
 

109
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,720
this whole packet over and you're pretty
much gonna tell the spectator that I

110
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:24,730
much gonna tell the spectator that I
 

111
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,979

want to take the four kings leave them

112
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:25,989
want to take the four kings leave them
 

113
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,259
want to take the four kings leave them
facedown on top of the deck and now if

114
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:28,269
facedown on top of the deck and now if
 

115
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:29,250
facedown on top of the deck and now if
you take a look at the order of the

116
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,260
you take a look at the order of the
 

117
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,710
you take a look at the order of the
cards we have three kings two random

118
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:31,720
cards we have three kings two random
 

119
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,170
cards we have three kings two random
cards and one last King so that's how

120
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,180
cards and one last King so that's how
 

121
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,240
cards and one last King so that's how
these cards are face down on top of the

122
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,250
these cards are face down on top of the
 

123
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,890
these cards are face down on top of the
deck

124
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:36,900
deck
 

125
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,690
deck
now for the first part we take one King

126
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:39,700
now for the first part we take one King
 

127
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,030
now for the first part we take one King
so two spectator you don't have to you

128
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,040
so two spectator you don't have to you
 

129
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,860
so two spectator you don't have to you
can if you want to just join them to

130
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:43,870
can if you want to just join them to
 

131
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,240
can if you want to just join them to
spectator makes it a bit more believable

132
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,250
spectator makes it a bit more believable
 

133
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,599
spectator makes it a bit more believable

134
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:48,609
show it to the spectator and put it
 

135
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:50,339
show it to the spectator and put it
facedown you know pretty much on the

136
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:50,349
facedown you know pretty much on the
 

137
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,259
facedown you know pretty much on the
bottom of the deck and as you're doing

138
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:52,269
bottom of the deck and as you're doing
 

139
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,300
bottom of the deck and as you're doing
so just make up some story about how the

completely inseparable just for you know
 

145
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,690
completely inseparable just for you know
fun and performance purposes so now once

146
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:00,700
fun and performance purposes so now once
 

147
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,190
fun and performance purposes so now once
that card is on the bottom we take the

148
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,200
that card is on the bottom we take the
 

149

next card make sure to not show this
 

151
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,400
next card make sure to not show this
card to the spectator because it's the

card to the spectator because it's the
 

153
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,890
card to the spectator because it's the
random card put that somewhere

154
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:10,900

 

155
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,559

put that somewhere else in the deck take

156
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:14,569
put that somewhere else in the deck take
 

157
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,750
put that somewhere else in the deck take
the other random card put that somewhere

158

you're really doing is showing four
 

205
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,670
you're really doing is showing four
kings with two cards hidden and I think

206
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:06,680
kings with two cards hidden and I think
 

207
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,900
kings with two cards hidden and I think
that's probably the most difficult part

208
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:07,910
