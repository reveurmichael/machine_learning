<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (0,7), and the apple is at (1,1). The current direction is UP. The body is at [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)]. So the snake is currently moving upwards, and the body is directly below the head. Wait, the head is at (0,7), and the body segments are from (0,3) up to (0,6). So the body is below the head, right? Because y decreases as you go down. So the snake is going up, and the body is in the same column (x=0) from y=3 to y=6. So the head is at y=7, then the next body parts are at 6,5,4,3. So the body is directly behind the head.

The apple is at (1,1). So the snake needs to move to the right once (from x=0 to x=1) and down 6 times (from y=7 to y=1). But the problem is that the snake's body is in the same column (x=0) from y=3 to y=6. So if the snake moves down, it might hit its own body. Also, the initial direction is UP. So the first move can't be DOWN because that's the reverse of the current direction. So the first move can't be DOWN.

So the snake is at (0,7) facing UP. The next move can't be DOWN. So possible first moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But moving LEFT would take the head to (-1,7), which is outside the grid. So LEFT is invalid. So the first move can be UP or RIGHT.

If the snake moves UP, the head would go to (0,8). Then the body would shift. But since the current direction is UP, moving UP again is allowed. But then the snake would be moving upwards, but the apple is to the right and down. However, moving up might not be the best path because the apple is below. But maybe the snake needs to go around the body somehow.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT first. The head would go to (1,7). Then the body would shift. The body is currently at (0,3) to (0,6). After moving right, the new head is (1,7), and the body becomes [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)]? Wait, no. Wait, the movement rules say that the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. But in this case, the apple is not eaten yet, so the tail is removed. Wait, the body is [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)] — that's four segments. The head is (0,7). When the snake moves, the head moves, then the body shifts. So the initial body is four segments. After moving, the new head is at the new position, and the tail (the last segment) is removed. Wait, but when the snake moves, the body shifts. For example, if the snake moves right from (0,7) to (1,7), the new head is (1,7), and the body becomes [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)], because the tail (0,6) is removed. Wait, but the body list is given as excluding the head. So the original body is [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)] — that's four body segments. So the head is (0,7), then the next body part is (0,6), then (0,5), etc. So when the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed. So after moving right, the new head is (1,7), and the body becomes [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)] — because the tail (0,6) is removed. Wait, but the original body is four segments. So when moving, the body length remains the same unless the apple is eaten. Wait, the problem says: "Eating the apple ... grows the body by 1 segment (tail doesn't shrink on next move)." So normally, when moving, the tail is removed. So the body length is the same as before, except when the apple is eaten, in which case the tail remains. So in the initial state, the body has four segments. So the snake's total length is 5 (head + 4 body parts). When moving, the tail is removed. So after moving, the body length is still 4. So the new head is added, and the last body segment is removed. So when the snake moves right from (0,7) to (1,7), the new body would be [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)], and the head is at (1,7). Then, the next move would need to avoid collisions.

But the apple is at (1,1). So the snake needs to move from (0,7) to (1,1). Let's think about the path. The snake is at (0,7), facing up. The body is in column 0 from y=3 to y=6. So if the snake moves up, it would go to (0,8), then (0,9), but then moving down again would be blocked by the body? Wait, if the snake moves up, then the body would shift. Let's see: moving up once, head is (0,8), body becomes [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)]? No, the original body is [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)]. When moving, the new head is added, and the tail is removed. So moving up from (0,7) to (0,8), the new body would be [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)], because the tail (0,6) is removed. Wait, but the original body is four segments. So the head is (0,7), body is [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)]. When moving, the new head is (0,8), and the body is [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]. Then, the next move up would take the head to (0,9), and the body becomes [(0,8), (0,7), (0,3), (0,4)]. Then, moving down would take the head to (0,8) again, but then the body would be [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,3)], etc. But perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, moving right first. So from (0,7) to (1,7). Then, the body is [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]. Now, the snake is at (1,7). Then, the next move could be down. Let's see: moving down from (1,7) to (1,6). Then, the body would be [(1,7), (0,7), (0,3), (0,4)]. Now, the head is at (1,6). Then, continue moving down. But need to check for collisions with the body. Let's see: after moving down to (1,6), the body is [(1,7), (0,7), (0,3), (0,4)]. The next move down would take the head to (1,5), and the body would be [(1,6), (1,7), (0,7), (0,3)]. Then, moving down again to (1,4), and so on. But the body segments are in column 0, so as long as the snake is moving in column 1, it should avoid the body. However, when the snake reaches lower y's, maybe it will have to move left or right again.

But the apple is at (1,1). So from (1,7), moving down six times would get to (1,1). But wait, the head is at (1,7), moving down six times: 7-6=1. So yes. But the problem is that the snake's body is in column 0. So moving down in column 1 would not collide with the body. However, when the snake moves down, the body shifts. Let me check each step.

First move: RIGHT to (1,7). Body becomes [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]. Then, moving down to (1,6). Body becomes [(1,7), (0,7), (0,3), (0,4)]. Then, moving down to (1,5). Body becomes [(1,6), (1,7), (0,7), (0,3)]. Then, moving down to (1,4). Body becomes [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,7)]. Then, moving down to (1,3). Body becomes [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]. Now, the body is [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]. Wait, but the original body was [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)] after the first move. Then, each subsequent move down adds the previous head to the body, and removes the tail. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the body tracking. Let me think again.

Original body: [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)] (excluding the head). Head is (0,7).

First move: RIGHT. New head is (1,7). The body now becomes [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)] — because the tail (0,6) is removed. Then, moving down: new head is (1,6). The body becomes [(1,7), (0,7), (0,3), (0,4)]. Next move down: head (1,5), body [(1,6), (1,7), (0,7), (0,3)]. Next move down: head (1,4), body [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,7)]. Next move down: head (1,3), body [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]. Next move down: head (1,2), body [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]. Next move down: head (1,1), which is the apple. Now, the body is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]. 

When the snake eats the apple, the body length increases by one. So after eating the apple, the tail is not removed. So the body would become [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] — because the tail (1,6) was not removed. Wait, no. Let me think: when the snake moves to the apple, it eats it. So the movement step is: moving to (1,1), which is the apple. Then, the tail is not removed. So the body would be [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] — the previous body was [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], and since the apple was eaten, the tail is not removed, so the new body would have one more segment. Wait, the original body length was 4, and after eating the apple, the body becomes 5. So when the head moves to (1,1), the new head is added, and the tail is not removed. So the body is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] — the previous body was [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], and adding the new head (1,1) and not removing the tail (1,6)? Wait, maybe I need to think about the body update process.

When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. So when moving to the apple, the tail is not removed. So for example, if the snake is at (1,2) with body [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], and moves to (1,1), which is the apple, the new head is (1,1), and the body becomes [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], because the tail (which would have been (1,5) in this case?) Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Let me rephrase the movement step. Suppose the snake's current head is at position H, and body is [B1, B2, ..., Bn]. When the snake moves in direction D, the new head is H + D. Then, the body becomes [H, B1, B2, ..., Bn-1] (if the apple is not eaten). If the apple is eaten, the body becomes [H, B1, B2, ..., Bn], because the tail is not removed. So in the case where the snake is moving towards the apple, after eating it, the body length increases by 1.

So in the scenario where the snake moves from (1,2) to (1,1) (apple), the previous body was [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]? Wait, no. Let's go back step by step.

Original body after moving right to (1,7) is [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]. Then, moving down six times:

1. (1,7) → body [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]
2. move down to (1,6) → body [(1,7), (0,7), (0,3), (0,4)]
3. move down to (1,5) → body [(1,6), (1,7), (0,7), (0,3)]
4. move down to (1,4) → body [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,7)]
5. move down to (1,3) → body [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]
6. move down to (1,2) → body [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]
7. move down to (1,1) → body [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] (since the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed)

So after eating the apple, the body is now 5 segments long. Now, the next move must be considered to ensure that the snake doesn't hit itself. For example, if the snake is at (1,1), with body [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)], then the next move can't be up (to (1,2), which is part of the body). So the snake needs to make sure that after eating the apple, it can move in a direction that doesn't collide with the body. However, the problem only requires the snake to reach the apple, not to survive after. But the question is whether the path is valid, i.e., the snake doesn't collide with itself during the movement.

In the path I outlined, the snake moves right once, then down six times. Let's check for collisions during each move.

First move: right from (0,7) to (1,7). No collision with body, which is in column 0.

Then, moving down from (1,7) to (1,6). The body is [(0,7), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)]. The new head is (1,6), which is not in the body. Then, moving down to (1,5). Body is [(1,7), (0,7), (0,3), (0,4)]. The new head (1,5) is not in the body. Then, moving down to (1,4). Body is [(1,6), (1,7), (0,7), (0,3)]. New head (1,4) is not in the body. Then, moving down to (1,3). Body is [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,7)]. New head (1,3) is not in the body. Then, moving down to (1,2). Body is [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]. New head (1,2) is not in the body. Then, moving down to (1,1). Body is [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]. New head (1,1) is not in the body, and since it's the apple, the body becomes [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)].

So this path seems valid. So the moves would be:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN
7. DOWN

That's 7 moves total. The initial position is (0,7), and the apple is at (1,1).

But the problem is, the snake starts facing up. The first move is RIGHT, which is allowed because the snake can change direction. There's no restriction on the direction of the first move.

But wait, the initial direction is up. The first move is RIGHT. That's a change in direction. Is that allowed? Yes, the snake can turn in any direction as long as it doesn't collide with itself.

So this seems to work. Therefore, the minimum number of moves is 7.

But let's check if there's a shorter path. For example, can the snake move diagonally? No, the snake moves in grid steps, one cell at a time, either up, down, left, or right. So the minimal number of steps to go from (0,7) to (1,1) is 7 steps: 1 right and 6 down. Since the Manhattan distance is 1 + 6 = 7. So this is the minimal number of steps.

Therefore, the answer is 7 moves. The path is RIGHT followed by six DOWNs.

But we need to make sure that during each move, the snake doesn't collide with its body.

As checked earlier, the path is valid. So the answer is 7.
</think>

To determine the minimum number of moves required for the snake to reach the apple from its starting position, we begin by analyzing the movement constraints and the structure of the problem.

---

### **Problem Summary**

- **Starting Position:** (0, 7)
- **Apple Position:** (1, 1)
- **Movement:** The snake can move one cell at a time in one of the four cardinal directions: up, down, left, or right.
- **Body Collision Rule:** The snake cannot move into a cell that is currently occupied by its body.
- **Initial Direction:** The snake starts facing **up**, but it is allowed to change direction freely.

---

### **Step-by-Step Movement Plan**

To minimize the number of moves, the snake should take the **shortest path** from (0,7) to (1,1), which is a **Manhattan distance** of:

$$
|1 - 0| + |7 - 1| = 1 + 6 = 7 \text{ moves}
$$

A direct path that achieves this is:

1. **RIGHT** → from (0,7) to (1,7)
2. **DOWN** × 6 → from (1,7) to (1,1)

This path consists of **1 right move** followed by **6 down moves**, totaling **7 moves**.

---

### **Collision Check**

We now verify that this path does **not** result in a body collision at any step:

- After the **first move (RIGHT)**, the snake is at (1,7), and the body is in column 0. No collision occurs.
- Each subsequent **down move** takes the snake into column 1, which is not occupied by its body. The body remains in column 0 or is updated to track the snake's movement in column 1.
- When the snake reaches (1,1), it eats the apple. At this point, the body length increases by one, but the new head (1,1) is not in the body, so no collision occurs.

Therefore, the path is valid and collision-free.

---

### **Conclusion**

The shortest and valid path for the snake to reach the apple from its starting position involves **7 moves**.

$$
\boxed{7}
