## Question

do we really need TIME_DELAY and TIME_TICK ? since we have PAUSE_BETWEEN_MOVES_SECONDS already.

## Answer

Yes, they serve different purposes, so you still need both:

1. PAUSE_BETWEEN_MOVES_SECONDS (in `ReplayEngine`)  
   • Governs the *game-logic* rhythm: how long the engine waits before it advances the snake to the next move in the recorded history.  
   • Directly controls playback speed (1 s ≈ very slow, 0.05 s ≈ fast-forward).  
   • Has no influence on how often Pygame polls for events or redraws the window within that one-second gap.

2. TIME_DELAY and TIME_TICK (in `config.constants`)  
   • Act on the *outer* while-loop (`pygame.time.delay(TIME_DELAY)` and `clock.tick(TIME_TICK)`) that keeps the GUI responsive.  
   • Provide a minimum sleep (`TIME_DELAY`) and a frame-rate cap (`TIME_TICK`) so the event loop doesn’t spin at thousands of iterations per second and burn CPU, especially when the game is paused or waiting for the next move.  
   • Even if you set `pause_between_moves` to a tiny value, the rendering loop will never exceed ~`TIME_TICK` FPS, which is important for predictable animation timing and laptop-fan friendliness.

In short:

• `pause_between_moves`  → *When does the snake step?*  
• `TIME_DELAY` / `TIME_TICK` → *How busy is the main loop / how often do we redraw?*

Removing the latter would not break the logic, but the program would consume far more CPU and the GUI timing would become platform-dependent. Keeping the three constants separated lets you tune playback speed and resource usage independently.
