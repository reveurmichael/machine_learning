  "reasoning": "The path moves RIGHT three times to align with the apple's x-coordinate (5), then DOWN twice to reach the apple's y-coordinate (1). This avoids collisions with the vertical body segment at x=2 and stays within bounds. The net RIGHT moves (3) and DOWN moves (2) match the required Manhattan distance."
