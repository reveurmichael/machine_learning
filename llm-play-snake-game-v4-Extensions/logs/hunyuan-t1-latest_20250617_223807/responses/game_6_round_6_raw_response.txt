"reasoning": "The snake starts at (2,2) with a vertical body along y=2-7. To reach (9,9), the shortest path is right 7 times (x=2→9) then up 7 times (y=2→9). Each right move avoids body collisions (body shifts left as head moves right). After reaching (9,2), moving up avoids body (now along x=9, y=2-6) and stays in bounds. Final move to (9,9) (apple) is safe, and next move left is possible (no immediate trap).",
