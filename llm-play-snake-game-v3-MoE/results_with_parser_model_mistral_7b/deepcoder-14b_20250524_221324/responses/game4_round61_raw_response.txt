<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (9,7) to eat the apple at (0,6). Let me start by understanding the current setup.

The snake's head is at (9,7), which is near the top-right corner. The body is a long line going down from (9,8) all the way back to (3,8). So the snake is currently moving in a downward direction because the head is at (9,7) and the next body part is (9,8), which would mean the head was previously above that. Wait, no—the current direction is "DOWN", so the head is moving down from (9,8) to (9,7). That makes sense.

The apple is at (0,6), which is on the left side, a bit below the top. The snake needs to move all the way across the grid to reach it. Since the snake's body is currently stretching from (9,8) down to (3,8), I need to plan a path that avoids colliding with any of these body segments as it moves.

First, I should check if there are any immediate obstacles. From the head at (9,7), possible directions are "DOWN", which would take it to (9,6), but looking at the body, the next segment is (8,8) and so on. Wait, no—the body list starts with (9,8), then (8,8), etc., meaning that after moving down, the head was at (9,7), then (9,8). So if the current direction is "DOWN", the next move can't be "UP" because of the no-reversal rule. The first move cannot reverse, so since it's currently going "DOWN", I can't choose "UP".

Wait, no—the rules say you can't reverse on the first move, but in this case, the snake is already moving in a direction (DOWN), and if we're planning subsequent moves after that, any new direction can't be the opposite. So from DOWN, I can't go UP next.

The apple is at (0,6). The head needs to move left all the way across, but considering the body's position, which is currently taking up most of the top row from x=3 to x=9 at y=8 and y=7. Wait, no—the body cells given are [(9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)], so that's a vertical line along x varying from 3 to 9 at y=8. The head is at (9,7). So the body is extending downward from (9,8) down to (9,7), but wait no—the body list starts with (9,8), which would be behind the head if the head is moving DOWN. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the snake's full structure is [HEAD, BODY1, ...]. The current head is at (9,7). The next body part is (9,8)—so that means the body is above the head? That doesn't make sense because if the direction is DOWN, the body should be below. Wait no—the way the body list is ordered: it's from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the head is at (9,7), and the current direction is DOWN, then the next body part would be (9,6). But in the given input, the body cells start with (9,8), which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait no—the initial state might have the snake's head at (9,7) moving DOWN. So the previous position of the head was (9,8), and now it's moved to (9,7). The body list is [(9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)], which means that after the head moves down, the body parts are following behind.

Wait no—the body cells are given as [(9,8), (8,8), ...], so this would be the order of the body segments. The head is at (9,7), and the first body segment is at (9,8). So that suggests that the snake was moving UP before, but now it's moving DOWN? No, because the current direction is DOWN.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about how the body follows. Let me think: when the snake moves, each new head position causes the body to shift. The body list provided starts with the segment immediately behind the head, so if the head is at (9,7), and the next body part is (9,8), that would imply that the snake was moving UP before, but now it's changing direction.

Wait no—the current direction is DOWN, meaning the head is moving down from its previous position. So perhaps the previous positions were (9,8) as the head, then moved to (9,7). Then the body segments would be [(9,8), (8,8), ...], which suggests that before the move, the snake was at (9,8) with a vertical line going down from there. But now it's moving DOWN, so the head is at (9,7), and the next segment is (9,8)—wait, no, because if you're moving down, the body should be below.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to visualize:

- Head: (9,7)
- Direction: DOWN
- Body cells: [(9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)]

Wait, this suggests that after moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), the body segments are all at y=8. That can't be right because if the head is at (9,7) and the direction is DOWN, then the next body part should be below it, not above.

Wait no—the body list represents the segments behind the head in order from nearest to farthest. So after the head moves down to (9,7), the previous position of the head was (9,8). Then, the body would follow: so the first body segment is where the head was before, which is (9,8), then the next one is (8,8), etc., suggesting that the snake's body was extending in a line from (9,8) to (3,8)—a horizontal line at y=8.

But if the head is moving down from (9,8) to (9,7), then the body would start with (9,8), followed by (8,8), etc. So after this move, the new head is (9,7), and the body becomes [(9,8), (8,8), ...]. But that means the snake's body is now at y=8, and the head is at (9,7). So when moving further down, the next body part would be (9,6), but that's not in the current list.

Wait no—the body cells given are only the ones behind the head. So after moving DOWN from (9,8) to (9,7), the body starts with (9,8), then (8,8), etc., meaning that the snake is now at (9,7) and has a body extending back along y=8.

So if the direction remains DOWN, the next head position would be (9,6). Then, after moving, the body list would have the old head (9,7) inserted at the front, making the body [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ...]. But wait, that can't form a continuous path because from (9,8) to (8,8) is left, not down. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body moves.

Wait no—the snake's body must be contiguous. Each segment must be adjacent to the previous one. So if the head is at (9,7), and the next body part is (9,8), that would mean that the body is moving upwards from there, which contradicts the direction of movement. This suggests that perhaps my initial understanding is wrong.

Wait no—the current direction is DOWN, so the head is moving down. That means the previous position was (9,8) and now it's at (9,7). The body list starts with (9,8), meaning that the first body segment is where the head was before. Then, the next segments are (8,8), which suggests that after (9,8), the snake turned left or right? Wait no—since each body part must be adjacent, moving from (9,8) to (8,8) would mean that the second body segment is to the left of (9,8). So perhaps the snake made a U-turn or something.

Wait, this might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the initial setup has the snake's head at (9,7), and the body list is [(9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)], which would mean that the body is extending from (9,8) to (3,8) in a straight line. So if the direction is DOWN, the head is moving down from (9,8) to (9,7). Then the next move could be further down, but I have to make sure that when the head moves, it doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail.

But wait, in the given state, the snake's head is at (9,7), and the body list starts with (9,8)—so after this move, the body would be [(9,8), (8,8), ...], meaning that the snake is now a vertical line from (9,7) up to (3,8). That seems possible.

Now, the apple is at (0,6). The head needs to get there. The Manhattan distance is |9-0| + |7-6|= 9+1=10 steps. But considering the body's movement and avoiding collisions, it might take longer.

But let's focus on the immediate next moves. Since the current direction is DOWN, I can't reverse to UP in the next move. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

Looking at (9,7), moving DOWN would take it to (9,6), but then I have to see if that position is blocked by any body segments. The body list starts with (9,8), so after inserting the old head into the body list, moving down from (9,7) to (9,6) shouldn't collide because the next body part is (9,8). Wait no—the body list is [(9,8), (8,8), ...], which are all at y=8 or higher. So if the head moves down to (9,6), that's below the body segments, so it should be safe.

But wait, after moving DOWN, the new position would be (9,6). Then, the body list would have the old head inserted: [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ...]. Now, from (9,6), possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But perhaps it's better to start moving the head towards the left since the apple is on the left side. However, moving LEFT from (9,7) would take the head to (8,7). Is that position occupied by any body segment? The current body list has (9,8), (8,8), etc., so at y=7, there are no body segments except possibly if they have moved down before.

Wait, after the first move DOWN from (9,8) to (9,7), the body list is [(9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)], meaning that at y=7, only the head is present. So moving LEFT from (9,7) would be safe.

But wait, if I move LEFT first, then the direction changes to LEFT, and future moves can't go RIGHT immediately. But perhaps it's better to start by moving left as soon as possible to begin the path towards the apple.

Alternatively, maybe moving down a few steps first to create space, but considering that the body is already long, it might be more efficient to move directly left.

Wait, but let me think about the body movement. Each time the head moves, the body follows by shifting each segment into the previous position, except the tail which may be cut off if the snake isn't growing.

In this problem, I assume the snake isn't growing; it's just moving, so the tail will follow as the head moves, potentially causing parts of the body to shift and possibly collide with themselves.

But in our case, since we're planning a path where the head can reach (0,6) without colliding with any part of its own body, perhaps starting by moving left is better.

So from (9,7), I can choose to move LEFT or continue DOWN. Since the apple is on the left, maybe moving LEFT is better.

Wait, but when you change direction, the next segment will be where the head was before. So if I move LEFT first, then the body's next segment would be at (9,7), which might interfere with future moves.

Alternatively, perhaps it's safer to move DOWN a few times first to clear the area above and create space on the left.

But let me consider each possible direction:

From (9,7):

- Moving LEFT: to (8,7). Is that position safe? Currently, in the body list, there's no segment at y=7 except perhaps after the head moves. So initially, it should be safe.

But wait, the body cells are given as [(9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)], meaning that all these are at y=8. After moving down to (9,7), the body list becomes [(9,8), (8,8), ...], so no segments are blocking (8,7). So it's safe.

So first move: LEFT to (8,7).

Next direction can't be RIGHT because we just moved LEFT.

But wait, no—the no-reversal rule only applies if you're changing direction by 180 degrees. So from LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT if they are exact opposites, but in grid movement, LEFT and RIGHT are opposite directions. Wait, actually, in grid terms, moving LEFT and then RIGHT is reversing, which isn't allowed within one step.

Wait no—the problem says you cannot change direction to the opposite (like from LEFT to RIGHT or RIGHT to LEFT) on the same move? Or perhaps it's that you can't reverse direction immediately after a turn. Wait, the rules say: "You are not allowed to reverse direction in consecutive moves." So if I go LEFT, then next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait no—the problem says: "You are not allowed to reverse direction in consecutive moves." So if my current move is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. Similarly, if I'm moving DOWN, the next move can't be UP.

So from (9,7), first move could be LEFT or RIGHT or continue DOWN.

Assuming I choose LEFT:

Move 1: LEFT to (8,7). Now, the direction is LEFT.

After this move, the body list would have the old head inserted at the front. So the new body list becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)]. Wait no—the body list represents all the segments behind the head. When you move LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7), the new head is (8,7). The body segments that were previously at [(9,8), (8,8), ...] would now shift: the first segment becomes where the head was before moving, which is (9,7). Then, each subsequent segment follows.

Wait no—the body list in the problem represents all the current body segments except the head. So when you move, the new body list is formed by inserting the old head at the front of the list and removing the last element if it's not growing.

But since we're assuming the snake isn't growing, each time the head moves, the tail follows, so the body length remains the same.

Wait no—the problem doesn't specify whether the snake is growing or not. It just says to plan a path where the head can reach the target without colliding with any part of its own body (including all body segments except the head).

So in this case, after moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7), the new position of the head is (8,7). The previous head was at (9,7), which becomes the first body segment. Then the rest follow: (9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8).

Wait no—the initial body list is [(9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)], which are all the segments behind the head at (9,7). So when the head moves to (8,7), the new body segments would be:

- New head: (8,7)
- Body: [ (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8) ]

Wait no—that doesn't make sense because from (8,7), the next segment must be adjacent. So (9,7) is to the right of (8,7). Then, the next body segment would have to be where (9,8) was, but that's at y=8, which is above (9,7). So the body segments after moving LEFT would be:

- Head: (8,7)
- Body1: (9,7)
- Body2: (9,8)
- Body3: (8,8)
- ...
- Tail: (3,8)

Wait, but that can't form a continuous path. From (9,7) to (9,8) is up, and then from (8,8) is left again. So the body would be:

(8,7) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (8,8) -> (7,8) -> ... -> (3,8)

But that creates a sort of L-shape in the body: from (8,7) right to (9,7), up to (9,8), left to (8,8), and so on. This might create a loop or cause collisions if not managed carefully.

Wait no—each time the head moves, all the body segments shift one step towards where the head was. So when the head moves from (9,7) to (8,7), each segment in the body list shifts:

- The first segment (which was at (9,8)) moves to (9,7)
- Then the next segment (8,8) moves to (9,8)
- And so on.

Wait no—that's not quite right. Each body part follows the path of the previous one. So when the head moves LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7), each segment in the body list will move into the position of the segment before it.

So:

Original positions:
Head: (9,7)
Body: [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8), ..., (3,8)]

After moving LEFT to (8,7):
New head: (8,7)
Body becomes:
- (9,7) [old head]
- Then the previous body segments move:
  - The first body segment (9,8) moves to where the old head was (9,7)
  - Second body segment (8,8) moves to (9,8)
  - Third body segment (7,8) moves to (8,8)
  - And so on until the tail.

Wait no—this might not be accurate. Actually, when the snake's head moves left, each body segment takes the place of the previous one. So:

Original positions:
Head: (9,7)
Body1: (9,8)
Body2: (8,8)
Body3: (7,8)
...
Tail: (3,8)

After moving LEFT to (8,7):
New head: (8,7)
Body1: (9,7) [was the old head]
Body2: (9,8) [moves from Body1's original position]
Wait no—that doesn't make sense because the body segments can't jump over each other.

Actually, when the head moves LEFT, all body segments follow in sequence. So:

- New head: (8,7)
- Old head becomes Body1: (9,7)
- Previous Body1 (which was at (9,8)) becomes Body2: (8,8)
Wait no—this is getting confusing.

Perhaps it's better to model the body as a list where each element represents the position of each segment. When the head moves, each segment takes the place of the previous one, except for the tail if the snake isn't growing.

But since we're not considering growth, the tail will just follow as the head moves, potentially causing overlaps if not managed.

So after moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7), the body segments would be:

New order:
Head: (8,7)
Body1: (9,7)
Body2: (9,8)
Body3: (8,8)
Body4: (7,8)
...
Tail: (4,8)

Wait no—that can't be right because Body2 should be where Body1 was before. I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Perhaps the key takeaway is that after moving LEFT from (9,7), the body segments would now be:

- Head at (8,7)
- Next segment at (9,7) [old head]
- Then (9,8)
- Then (8,8)
- And so on until the tail.

So when checking for collisions, I need to ensure that the new head's position doesn't overlap with any of these body segments except itself.

But in this case, after moving LEFT to (8,7), none of the body segments are at (8,7) yet. The closest is (9,7) which is Body1 now at (9,7). So no collision occurs.

So first move: LEFT to (8,7).

Now, from (8,7), possible directions are DOWN, RIGHT, or continue LEFT.

If I continue moving LEFT, the direction remains LEFT, and I can't reverse immediately. But perhaps it's better to start moving down towards the apple which is at y=6 eventually.

Alternatively, maybe move further left first.

Wait, but the exact position of the apple isn't given. It says "reach (0,6)", so the target is (0,6). So the head needs to reach column 0, row 6.

So from (9,7), I need to move all the way left to (0, something) and then down or up as needed.

Wait no—the target is (0,6), which is at x=0, y=6. So perhaps it's better to move down first to reach row 6, then move left.

But from (9,7), moving down would take me closer to y=6.

Alternatively, I can start by moving all the way left along y=7 to x=0, then move down to y=6. But that might be a longer path and could potentially cause collisions with the body as it moves around.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient path is to move down first to clear the area above, then move left.

But given that the snake's body is already occupying several positions at y=8, maybe moving down would create space on the left side.

Wait, but let me think about what's in front of the head after each move.

Starting from (9,7), if I first move DOWN to (9,6). Is that safe?

After moving DOWN from (9,7) to (9,6):

- New body segments would be:

Head: (9,6)
Body1: (9,7)
Body2: (9,8)
Body3: (8,8)
... and so on.

So no collision with any body segments except the old head which is now Body1 at (9,7), which isn't overlapping with (9,6). So it's safe.

Then, from (9,6), I can choose to move LEFT towards (0,6).

But wait, the target is (0,6), so once I'm on y=6, I can just keep moving left all the way.

So perhaps the optimal path is:

1. Move DOWN from (9,7) to (9,6)
2. Then continuously move LEFT until reaching (0,6)

But let's check for collisions as we do this.

After step 1: head at (9,6), body segments are [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8)]

No collision here.

Step 2: Move LEFT to (8,6). Now, after moving:

Head: (8,6)
Body: [ (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8) ]

Check if any body segments are at (8,6): no.

Continue moving LEFT to (7,6):

Head: (7,6)
Body: [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ..., (3,8) ]

No collision.

Similarly, continue this until reaching (0,6).

But wait, as we move left along y=6, the body segments behind are shifting. For example:

When at (5,6):

Head: (5,6)
Body1: (6,6)
Body2: (7,6)
...
Wait no—actually, each time you move LEFT, the entire body shifts one to the right.

Wait no—the body follows the path of the head. So as we move left along y=6, each segment in the body will eventually occupy positions on y=6 and y=7, etc.

But wait, initially, after moving down to (9,6), all body segments are at y>=7 except for Body1 at (9,7) and higher.

Wait no—when you move down from (9,7) to (9,6), the new head is at (9,6). The old head (9,7) becomes Body1. Then Body2 was at (9,8), which moves to where Body1 was: (9,7). And so on.

So after step 1:

Head: (9,6)
Body1: (9,7)
Body2: (9,8)
Body3: (8,8)
...
Tail: (3,8)

Now, moving LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6):

New head: (8,6)
Body1: (9,6)
Body2: (9,7)
Body3: (9,8)
Body4: (8,8)
...

So no collision at (8,6).

Similarly, moving LEFT again:

Head: (7,6)
Body1: (8,6)
Body2: (9,6)
Body3: (9,7)
...
No collision.

Continuing this way until reaching (0,6). At each step, the new head position is checked against all body segments except itself. Since we're moving left along y=6 and the body segments behind are either on higher y's or shifting to fill in, there shouldn't be any collisions as long as we don't cross over any existing body parts.

Wait a second—what about when the body starts to fold back? For example, after several moves left, some of the body segments might end up on the same row as the head but further right, which could cause a collision if not managed.

But in this specific case, since we're moving straight left along y=6 and the initial body is all above y=7 except for the first few steps, it should be safe until the body starts overlapping with itself.

Wait no—if I move all the way from (9,6) to (0,6), that's 9 moves LEFT. Each time, the body segments behind will follow, but since we're moving in a straight line without turning except for the initial DOWN move, there shouldn't be any self-intersections until maybe when parts of the body start overlapping with each other.

Wait no—if you imagine the snake as a long line, moving all the way left on y=6 after being at (9,7) and then down to (9,6), the body will form a sort of vertical column from (3,8) up to (9,8), then a horizontal line from (9,8) to (9,7), (9,6), and then extending left from there.

But as we move left along y=6, the body segments behind are following in order. So each segment on y=6 will be at x decreasing by 1 each time, so no two segments will occupy the same position unless they catch up with each other.

Wait, actually, since the snake is moving forward, each new head position is unique and not overlapping with any existing body segments except when the tail moves into a space vacated by the head. But in this case, we're only concerned about the head colliding with its own body, not the entire body.

So as long as the head doesn't step on any of the body segments behind it (excluding itself), it's safe.

In this scenario, moving straight left from (9,6) to (0,6) should be collision-free because none of the body parts are in the way. The only time a collision might occur is if part of the body wraps around and intersects with the head's path, but since we're moving in a straight line without any turns except the initial downward move, that shouldn't happen.

Therefore, the optimal path would be:

1. Move DOWN from (9,7) to (9,6).
2. Then move LEFT repeatedly until reaching (0,6).

This ensures that the head doesn't collide with any part of its body and reaches the target efficiently.
</think>

To reach the target position (0,6), follow these steps:

1. **Move DOWN** from your current position to (9,6). This allows you to align yourself on the row where the target is located.

2. **Move LEFT** repeatedly until you reach column 0 on row 6. Keep moving left without turning until you reach the destination.

This path ensures no collisions with your own body and efficiently navigates to the goal.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Start at (9,7).**
2. **Move DOWN** to (9,6).
3. **Move LEFT** to (8,6).
4. Continue moving LEFT until you reach (0,6).

This sequence avoids collisions and directly routes the head to the target.

**Answer:** The optimal path is to move down once to row 6, then left all the way to column 0. So, the final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Move DOWN then LEFT repeatedly}}
