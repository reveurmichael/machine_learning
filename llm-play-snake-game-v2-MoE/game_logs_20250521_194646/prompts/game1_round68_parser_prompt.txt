Okay, I need to figure out how to help the snake eat the apple at (4,8) without dying. Let's start by understanding the current situation.

The snake's head is at (8,8), which is near the top-right corner. The body cells are listed as [(1,4), (2,4), ..., (8,7)], so the snake is quite long and winding. The apple is at (4,8), which is to the left of the head but on the same row.

First, I should note that the snake can't reverse direction immediately. It's currently moving in a certain direction, which is given as UP, but wait—looking at the body cells, it seems like the snake is actually moving upward because the tail is at (1,4) and the head is higher up at (8,8). Wait, no—the current direction is UP, so the next move can't be DOWN.

Wait, let me clarify. The movement rules say that if the current direction is "UP", the next move cannot be DOWN. So from the given state, the snake's head is moving in a certain direction, and I need to plan moves accordingly without reversing.

Looking at the body cells, they form a path from (1,4) up to (8,7), which suggests that the snake has been moving upwards for several steps. The apple is at (4,8), so it's directly below the head but on the same row? Wait no—wait, in the coordinate system, UP increases y by 1. So from (8,8) moving up would take it to (8,9), which is out of bounds since y ranges from 0-9. Therefore, the current direction can't be UP because that's outside the grid. Wait, no—the head is at (8,8). If the snake is currently facing UP, then moving UP would take it to (8,9), which is invalid. So perhaps there's a mistake in understanding the current direction.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the current direction. Let me check again. The current direction is given as "UP", but if the head is at (8,8) and moves UP, that would take it to (8,9), which is invalid because y can only go up to 9? Wait no—no, wait: in the coordinate system, UP is y +1. So from (8,8), moving UP would be (8,9), but since the grid is 0-9 for both x and y, that's a valid position? Or does it wrap around? No, movement outside the grid causes death.

Wait no—the problem states that if the snake moves outside the grid, it dies. So the current direction is UP, meaning the next move would be to (8,9), which is invalid because y can't exceed 9. Therefore, moving UP from (8,8) is impossible without dying. So perhaps there's a mistake in the given information—maybe the snake isn't currently facing UP but another direction.

Wait no—the problem states that the current direction is UP. Hmm, this seems like a problem because moving UP would take it out of bounds. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the movement. Let me re-examine the grid: (0,0) is bottom-left, so moving UP increases y by 1, meaning (8,8) moving UP goes to (8,9), which is invalid as y can only be up to 9? Wait no—wait, in the problem statement, coordinates are from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So y ranges from 0 to 9. Therefore, moving UP from (8,8) would take it to (8,9), which is a valid position because y=9 is allowed.

Wait no—no, wait: in the movement rules, direction vectors are "UP": (0,1). So starting at (8,8), adding (0,1) gives (8,9). But since the grid is 10x10, with x and y from 0 to 9 inclusive, that's a valid position. Wait no—wait, 10×10 grid means x and y go up to 9, so (8,9) is within bounds.

Wait, but in the movement rules, it says the snake dies if it moves outside the grid. So moving UP from (8,8) is valid because y becomes 9, which is allowed. So that's okay. But I need to check whether the new head position after each move doesn't collide with the body and remains within bounds.

So the current direction is UP, meaning the next move can't be DOWN. The apple is at (4,8). Let me plot the positions.

The snake's head is at (8,8), which is near the top-right corner. The apple is at (4,8), which is directly to the left on the same row.

I need to find a path from (8,8) to (4,8) without colliding with the body and ensuring that after eating the apple, there's still room to move (so the tail doesn't trap the head).

Looking at the body cells: [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7)]. So from x=1 to 8 in y=4, then up to (7,5), (7,6), and (8,7). Wait, the head is at (8,8), so the body is behind it.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out. The snake's body starts at (1,4) and goes right to (8,4), then up to (7,5), (7,6), (8,7). So after (8,7), the next cell is the head at (8,8).

So the body is in a sort of L-shape from (1,4) to (8,7), with the tail at (1,4).

The apple is at (4,8), which is on the same row as the head but further left.

Now, I need to find a path for the head to move towards (4,8) without colliding with its body. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again if allowed.

Wait no—current direction is UP. The movement rules state that you can't reverse direction, but moving in the same direction is allowed unless it's NONE. Wait, rule 3 says you can't reverse direction—if current direction is UP, next move can't be DOWN. So from UP, possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT—unless the new direction would reverse.

Wait no—rule 3 says that if the direction is "NONE", any move is allowed. But in this case, the current direction is UP, so the next move can't be DOWN. So the possible directions for the first move are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.

But moving UP from (8,8) would take it to (8,9), which is valid, but then I need to see if that's useful for reaching (4,8). Alternatively, moving LEFT from (8,8) would go to (7,8), which is on the same row as the apple.

Wait, let me think: the head is at (8,8). If it moves LEFT once, it goes to (7,8). Then, can it continue moving LEFT each time until it reaches (4,8)? Let's see:

Current body cells are up to (8,7), so after moving to (7,8), the new head is there. The body will shift: all segments move forward, and the tail remains if apple is eaten.

But wait, when the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless it eats an apple. So in this case, since we're moving towards the apple but not yet eating it, the tail would be removed each step until the apple is eaten.

Wait no—when you eat the apple, the tail doesn't shrink on the next move. So when the head moves into the apple's position, the body grows by one segment.

So let's plan a path:

1. From (8,8), current direction is UP. Possible first moves: LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again.

But moving UP would take it to (8,9). Then from there, it needs to move left several times. But that seems longer and may not be the optimal path.

Alternatively, moving LEFT to (7,8) seems more direct towards the apple at (4,8).

So let's consider:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,8)

Now, check if this position is safe. The body after the move would have the previous head at (8,8) added as a new segment? Wait no—when the snake moves, the new head becomes (7,8), and all body segments shift forward. So the old head (8,8) is now part of the body.

Looking at the current body cells: [(1,4), (2,4), ..., (8,6), (8,7)]. After moving LEFT to (7,8), the new body will be:

The previous head (8,8) becomes the new position before the tail. So the body cells would now include all positions from (2,4) up to (8,8), but I need to make sure that the new head at (7,8) doesn't collide with any existing body segments.

Looking at the current body cells: The only cell in the same row y=8 is (8,7). So after moving LEFT, the new head is at (7,8), which is not part of the body. So it's safe.

Next move: from (7,8), possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again? Wait no—current direction was UP, but the first move was LEFT, so the current direction changes to LEFT for subsequent moves unless constrained by other rules.

Wait, movement is determined step by step. Each move changes the direction, provided it doesn't reverse.

So after moving LEFT once, the new direction is LEFT. So next move can't be RIGHT.

But wait, no—the movement allows any direction except reversing. So if I'm currently facing LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. But in this case, the initial direction was UP, and the first move is LEFT. So after that, the current direction is LEFT, so next moves can't be RIGHT.

Wait, but when you make a move, your new direction becomes the one you moved into. So from UP, moving LEFT changes the direction to LEFT for the next step.

So for each move, you can't reverse direction.

So let's plan:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,8), current direction is now LEFT.

Now, check if (6,8) is safe. The body segments are [(2,4), ..., (7,8)]. Wait no—the body after the first move would have all previous body cells plus the new head at (7,8). So the body is now:

[(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]? No—wait, when the snake moves, the tail is removed unless it eats an apple. Since we haven't eaten the apple yet, after each move, the tail is removed.

Wait no—the movement rule says that after eating the apple, the tail remains on the next move. But in this case, we're moving towards the apple but haven't eaten it yet, so the tail is removed each step.

So when the head moves LEFT to (7,8), the tail at (1,4) is removed because the snake didn't eat an apple. So the body becomes [(2,4), (3,4), ..., (8,7)] plus the new position (8,8). Wait no—the head was at (8,8), moved to (7,8), so the body segments after this move are all previous body cells except the tail, which is now removed.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The snake's body includes all positions from the second last position up to the new head. So when moving from (8,8) LEFT to (7,8), the old head at (8,8) becomes part of the body, and the tail at (1,4) is removed.

So after move 1:

Head: (7,8)

Body cells: [(2,4), (3,4), ..., (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]

Now, check for collision. The new head at (7,8) must not be in the body. Looking at the body cells after move 1: none are at (7,8). So safe.

Move 2: Again, from (7,8), current direction is LEFT. Next possible moves can't be RIGHT because that would reverse the direction (LEFT to RIGHT). So next moves can be LEFT or UP or DOWN? Wait no—current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN.

But moving further LEFT from (7,8) would take it to (6,8), which is towards the apple. Let's check if that's safe.

After move 2: LEFT → (6,8). New body cells after this move would be:

Body: [(3,4), ..., (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8)] and the tail at (2,4) is removed. So new body segments are from (3,4) up to (7,8).

Check if (6,8) is in the body: no.

So move 2 is safe.

Move 3: LEFT → (5,8). Check safety. Body after this move would be [(4,4), ..., (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)] and tail at (3,4) removed. No collision with head.

Continue moving LEFT:

Move 4: (4,8). Now the head is at (4,8), which is where the apple is located.

Upon reaching (4,8), since it's the apple's position, the snake eats it, and the body grows by one segment without removing the tail.

So after this move, the body cells are:

[(5,4), ..., (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)]

Wait no—the exact body after eating would include all previous segments plus the new head at (4,8). The tail remains because it's an apple eaten.

So now, the snake's length increases by one. So the next move must ensure that the new position isn't blocked by the updated body.

But in this case, we need to reach (4,8) and then perhaps make another move to escape.

Wait, but after eating the apple at (4,8), what's the next step? The problem is whether moving further from there would be possible without colliding with the now longer body.

Alternatively, once the snake eats the apple, we might not need to move further because the goal is achieved. But I think the question expects a path that allows the snake to reach the apple and still have space.

Wait, no—the problem says "You are supposed to find a way out of this maze." So perhaps it's more about reaching the exit, but in this case, the apple is considered an exit point? Or maybe the problem is just to navigate to the apple.

Assuming that once the snake reaches (4,8), it has exited, but we need to make sure that after eating the apple, there's still space for the snake to not be trapped.

So after moving LEFT four times:

Move 1: (7,8)

Move 2: (6,8)

Move 3: (5,8)

Move 4: (4,8) → ate the apple.

Now, check if the snake can still move. Since it's now longer by one segment after eating, but the position at (4,8) is the apple.

But perhaps we don't need to go further; maybe reaching (4,8) is sufficient.

Alternatively, let's see what happens next.

After moving to (4,8), the snake has grown. So the body would be:

From previous step after move 3: [(5,4), ..., (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)]

Wait no—the exact positions are a bit unclear. But regardless, once at (4,8), the snake has successfully eaten the apple.

But perhaps we need to find a path that allows the snake to reach the apple and then have an escape route.

Alternatively, maybe moving straight LEFT four times is sufficient.

So in total:

Moves: 1: LEFT, 2: LEFT, 3: LEFT, 4: LEFT → reaches (4,8).

But let's verify each step for safety:

Move 1: (7,8) safe.

Move 2: (6,8) safe.

Move 3: (5,8) safe.

Move 4: (4,8) safe and apple eaten.

So the sequence is four LEFT moves.

Alternatively, could there be a shorter path? Since it's only moving along the same row y=8 from x=8 to x=4, which requires moving left four times.

Yes, that seems correct.

But wait—what about if after eating the apple at (4,8), can the snake move further without getting stuck?

After eating, the body would include all previous segments plus (4,8). So the new tail is still at (5,4) unless something changes. But since we ate the apple, the next move won't remove the tail.

But perhaps after reaching (4,8), the snake can turn direction to go further, but that's beyond the scope of just reaching the apple.

So the minimal path is four LEFT moves.
</think>

The snake needs to move left four times to reach the apple at position (4,8) without colliding with its body. Each move changes the direction and avoids reversing.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (8,8), current direction is UP.
2. **Move 1 - LEFT**: New position (7,8). Safe as it's not in the body segments after tail removal.
3. **Move 2 - LEFT**: New position (6,8). Safe similarly.
4. **Move 3 - LEFT**: New position (5,8). Safe.
5. **Move 4 - LEFT**: New position (4,8), where the apple is located.

Thus, moving LEFT four times allows the snake to reach and eat the apple safely.
