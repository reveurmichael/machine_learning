```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move up 5 times to reach the apple's y-coordinate, then move left 6 times to reach the apple's x-coordinate. The initial moves are safe as they avoid the snake's body and stay within grid bounds."
