Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (4,6) to the apple at (8,3). Let's break this down.

First, let's visualize the grid. The snake starts with its head at (4,6), which is somewhere in the upper middle part of the grid. The body cell given is [(4,5)], so the snake has two segments: the head and one behind it. That means the snake is length 2.

The apple is at (8,3), which is towards the top-right corner but a bit lower on the y-axis. So from the head's current position, I need to move right and down a bit to reach it.

Looking at the direction rules, the snake is currently moving in "UP". Wait, no—the current direction is given as "NONE", so that means the snake isn't moving yet or just started? Or maybe it was previously moving but now stopped. Regardless, the first move can be any direction except the reverse of NONE, which I think allows any direction since NONE implies no prior movement.

Wait, no. The rules say if current direction is NONE, any first move is allowed. So for the first move, I can choose any direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

But wait, the initial direction given is "NONE", so that means the snake isn't moving in a particular direction yet. Or maybe it's just after starting or between moves. Hmm, but according to the movement rules, if current direction is NONE, any first move is allowed. So I can choose any of the four directions.

But wait, no—the current direction is given as "NONE", which might mean that the snake isn't moving in a particular direction, perhaps it's just waiting or something. But for the initial move, since the current direction is NONE, any direction is allowed except reversing, but since there's no previous direction to reverse from, all are possible.

So first, I need to decide the path.

The head is at (4,6). The apple is at (8,3). So the x-coordinate needs to increase by 4 (from 4 to 8), and the y-coordinate needs to decrease by 3 (from 6 to 3).

But movement is step by step, so I need to plan a path that avoids collisions with walls and body segments.

First move options: since current direction is NONE, can go any direction. Let's think about possible paths.

Option 1: Move right as much as possible. From (4,6), moving right would go towards higher x-values. But the apple is at (8,3), so maybe a combination of right and down movements.

But I have to be careful with the body segments. The body is currently at (4,5). So if I move in a way that the new head doesn't collide with this body segment or any future positions.

Wait, when moving, after each step, the body shifts. So let's think about how the body moves.

If the snake is currently at [(4,6) head, (4,5)], and I choose to move right first, then:

- New head would be (5,6). Then, since it didn't eat an apple, the tail (4,5) would move into (4,6), but wait no—the body cells are given as [(4,5)], which is behind the head. So when moving, the old head (4,6) becomes the new body part at the front.

Wait, let me clarify:

When you make a move, the steps are:

1. Compute new head based on direction.
2. Check for collisions: if new_head is out of bounds or collides with any body except possibly the tail's current position (if that tail will move this turn).
3. If no collision, update the body:
   a. Insert old head into the front of the body list.
   b. If new head is apple, grow (don't remove tail). Else, remove last element (tail).

So in the initial state:

Head: (4,6)
Body: [(4,5)]

If I move right to (5,6), then:

- New head is (5,6).
- Check collision: new_head isn't out of bounds. The body is at (4,5). Is (5,6) colliding with any body? No, because the only body is (4,5).

So no collision.

Then update body:

a. Insert old head (4,6) into front → body becomes [(4,6), (4,5)].
b. Since new_head != apple position (apple is at (8,3)), we remove tail (4,5). So the new body is [(4,6)].

Wait no: initial body is [(4,5)]. After inserting old head, it becomes [old_head] + body → [ (4,6), (4,5) ]. Then, since not eating apple, remove last element (tail): so body becomes [ (4,6) ].

So the new state would be:

Head: (5,6)
Body: [(4,6)]

Wait no—wait. The body is a list that starts with the segment immediately behind the head. So after moving right, the old head (4,6) is now the first body segment, and the previous body was at (4,5). But since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (which was (4,5)), so the new body is [ (4,6) ].

Wait no: initial body is [(4,5)]. After inserting old head, it's [ (4,6), (4,5) ]. Then, since not eating apple, we remove the last element, which is (4,5). So body becomes [ (4,6) ].

So now, the snake has head at (5,6), and one body segment at (4,6).

Wait no—no. The initial body is [(4,5)]. After inserting old head (4,6) into the front, the body list becomes [ (4,6), (4,5) ]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the last element (the tail), which was (4,5). So the new body is [ (4,6) ].

Wait no—no. The initial body is [(4,5)], meaning that after the head, the next segment is (4,5). When moving right:

New head: (5,6)

Body update steps:

a. Insert old head (4,6) at front → new body list is [ (4,6), (4,5) ].

b. Since not eating apple, remove last element (tail) → new body list becomes [ (4,6) ].

So the snake's body now has one segment: (4,6). So the full snake is:

Head: (5,6)
Body: [(4,6)]

Wait no—the full snake includes all segments. The head is at (5,6), then the body is [ (4,6) ], which is directly behind it? Wait no—Manhattan distance between (5,6) and (4,6) is 1, so that's fine.

Now, for the next move. Let's say I continue moving right to (6,6). Then:

New head: (6,6)

Check collision: body segments are [ (4,6) ] → no collision.

Update body:

a. Insert old head (5,6) at front → body becomes [ (5,6), (4,6) ].
b. Not eating apple, remove tail (4,6). New body is [ (5,6) ].

So now, head at (6,6), body at (5,6).

This seems okay. But I need to plan a path towards the apple at (8,3). Let's think about possible routes.

Another option: instead of moving right first, maybe move down to clear a path or something. Wait, but the apple is below and to the right, so perhaps moving right and then down would be better.

But let me consider the coordinates:

Current head: (4,6)
Apple: (8,3)

So x needs to increase by 4, y decreases by 3.

If I move right four times, then down three times, that's one possible path. But I have to ensure that each step doesn't cause a collision with the body or walls.

Wait, but after each move, the body shifts, so I need to track how the body moves and whether it blocks my path.

Let me try to plan a possible sequence:

1. Move RIGHT from (4,6) → head at (5,6). Body becomes [ (4,6) ].
2. Move RIGHT again → (6,6). Body: insert (5,6), then remove tail (4,6). Now body is [ (5,6) ].
3. Continue moving right to (7,6), (8,6).
But wait, the apple is at (8,3), so I'd need to go down from there.

Wait, but after reaching (8,6), I can start moving down towards y=3.

But let's see:

After step 4: head at (8,6). Then move DOWN to (8,5), then again to (8,4), and so on until (8,3).

But wait, when I'm at (8,6) and move down, the new head is (8,5). The body would be:

After each right move, body segments are added in front and tail removed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to plan a more direct path. Alternatively, maybe moving down first to get closer vertically.

But let me think about possible collisions. Since the initial body is only one segment behind, as long as I don't reverse direction or cause the head to collide with its own body (which is just one cell), I should be fine.

Wait, but when moving in a straight line, after each move, the body follows, so I have to make sure that my path doesn't require me to step into a cell that will soon be occupied by a body segment.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to move right and then down, but let's see:

Possible path:

1. RIGHT → (5,6). Body: [ (4,6) ].
2. RIGHT → (6,6). Body: [ (5,6) ].
3. RIGHT → (7,6). Body: [ (6,6) ].
4. RIGHT → (8,6). Body: [ (7,6) ].

Now at (8,6), I need to move down:

5. DOWN → (8,5). Check collision: body is [ (7,6) ], which is not in the path. So safe.

Then:

6. DOWN → (8,4)
7. DOWN → (8,3)

So that's 7 moves total: right four times and down three times.

But wait, each time I move, the body shifts, so after step 1 (RIGHT), body is [ (4,6) ].

Wait no—after first RIGHT:

Head: (5,6)
Body: inserted old head (4,6). Then since not eating apple, remove tail (which was at (4,5)). Wait wait, initial body was [(4,5)], right?

Wait no—the initial state is:

Head: (4,6)
Body: [ (4,5) ]

So when I move RIGHT to (5,6):

a. Insert old head (4,6) into front → new body list is [ (4,6), (4,5) ].

b. Since not eating apple, remove last element (tail is (4,5)). So new body is [ (4,6) ].

So after first move:

Head: (5,6)
Body: [ (4,6) ]

Now, moving right again to (6,6):

a. Insert old head (5,6) → body becomes [ (5,6), (4,6) ].

b. Remove last element (4,6). So new body is [ (5,6) ].

So now:

Head: (6,6)
Body: [ (5,6) ]

Third move right to (7,6):

a. Insert (6,6) → body becomes [ (6,6), (5,6) ].

b. Remove last (5,6). New body: [ (6,6) ].

Fourth move right to (8,6):

a. Insert (7,6) → body becomes [ (7,6), (6,6) ].

b. Remove last (6,6). Body: [ (7,6) ].

Now head is at (8,6), body at (7,6).

Then move down to (8,5):

a. Insert (8,6) → body becomes [ (8,6), (7,6) ].

b. Remove last (7,6). Body: [ (8,6) ].

Wait no—wait, when moving from (8,6) down to (8,5):

New head is (8,5).

Body before this move was [ (7,6) ].

After inserting old head (8,6), body becomes [ (8,6), (7,6) ].

Since new head isn't apple, remove last element (7,6). So new body is [ (8,6) ].

So now:

Head: (8,5)
Body: [ (8,6) ]

Wait, but the body segment is at (8,6), which is directly above the head. That's okay because it's only one cell apart and in a different direction. No collision.

Then move down to (8,4):

a. Insert old head (8,5) → body becomes [ (8,5), (8,6) ].

b. Remove last (8,6). Body: [ (8,5) ].

Wait no—after moving down from (8,5) to (8,4):

New head is (8,4).

Body before move was [ (8,6) ]? Wait no—wait:

Wait after the first down move from (8,6) to (8,5), body became [ (8,6) ].

Then moving down again:

Head: (8,5)
Body: [ (8,6) ]

Move down:

New head: (8,4)

Check collision: body is at (8,6). No collision.

Update body:

a. Insert old head (8,5) → body becomes [ (8,5), (8,6) ].

b. Remove last element (8,6). So new body is [ (8,5) ].

So now:

Head: (8,4)
Body: [ (8,5) ]

Another down move:

New head: (8,3)

Check collision: body is at (8,5). No collision with (8,3).

Update body:

a. Insert old head (8,4) → body becomes [ (8,4), (8,5) ].

b. Remove last element (8,5). So new body is [ (8,4) ].

Now, since the new head is at (8,3), which is the apple's position, we've reached it. But wait, in this step, after moving down to (8,3), have I eaten the apple?

Yes, because the apple is at (8,3). So when I move into that cell, since it's the apple, I don't remove the tail.

So steps:

1. RIGHT → (5,6); body [ (4,6) ]

2. RIGHT → (6,6); body [ (5,6) ]

Wait no—wait, earlier analysis showed that after each move, the body is updated differently.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe a better way is to plan a path where I don't have to worry about the body blocking me since it's only length 2 and I can manage the movements to avoid collision.

Alternatively, maybe moving down first would be better.

Wait, but the apple is below and to the right. So perhaps moving right then down makes more sense.

But let's try another approach. Maybe move down a few times first.

From (4,6), if I move down:

New head: (4,5). Wait no—wait, current body is at (4,5). If I move down from (4,6) to (4,5), that would be the same as the current body segment. So collision occurs. That's not allowed.

So can't move down first. Because moving down would take me into (4,5), which is the current body segment.

Similarly, if I try to move left from (4,6) → (3,6). Then:

Check collision: no, since body is at (4,5).

But that's away from the apple, so not ideal.

Alternatively, move up. From (4,6), moving up would go out of bounds because y=7 might be beyond the grid? Wait, assuming the grid is at least 8x something, but if y=6 is the top, then moving up may not be possible. But I think in this problem, we can assume that movement is within a grid, so maybe up from (4,6) would go to (4,7), which is valid.

But since the apple is at (8,3), which is below and right, perhaps it's better to move right first.

So back to initial plan:

1. RIGHT → (5,6); body [ (4,6) ]

2. RIGHT → (6,6); body [ (5,6) ]

Wait no—wait after step 1: moving right to (5,6), body becomes [ (4,6) ].

Then step 2: move right again to (6,6). Insert old head (5,6) into front → body [ (5,6), (4,6) ]. Then remove tail (4,6). So new body is [ (5,6) ].

Step 3: move right to (7,6); insert (6,6) → body becomes [ (6,6), (5,6) ], then remove (5,6). Body: [ (6,6) ]

Step 4: move right to (8,6); insert (7,6) → body [ (7,6), (6,6) ], remove (6,6). Body: [ (7,6) ]

Now head is at (8,6), body at (7,6).

Then step 5: move down to (8,5); insert (8,6) → body [ (8,6), (7,6) ]; remove (7,6). Body: [ (8,6) ]

Step 6: move down to (8,4); insert (8,5) → body [ (8,5), (8,6) ]; remove (8,6). Body: [ (8,5) ]

Step 7: move down to (8,3); since this is the apple's position:

Insert old head (8,4) → body becomes [ (8,4), (8,5) ].

But since we've eaten the apple, we don't remove the tail. So new body is [ (8,4), (8,5) ].

So after this move, the snake's body is:

Head: (8,3)
Body: [ (8,4), (8,5) ]

This way, no collision occurs during any step.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path or a different route, but I think this should work.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to guide the snake from its starting position at (4,6) to the apple located at (8,3) without colliding with its own body. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move updates the snake's position and shifts its body accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (4,6) with its body at (4,5).
2. **Move Right**: The snake moves right to increase its x-coordinate while ensuring it doesn't collide with its body.
3. **Continue Moving Right**: Repeat the rightward movement until the snake reaches x=8.
4. **Move Down**: Once aligned vertically above the apple, the snake starts moving down to reach y=3.

By following this path, we ensure that each move is valid and avoids collisions with the snake's body.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial position of the snake's head
head = (4, 6)
# The body of the snake follows; initially at (4,5)
body = [(4,5)]

# Move right four times to reach x=8
for _ in range(4):
    # Move right: increase x by 1
    new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
    # Insert the new head at the beginning of the body list
    body.insert(0, new_head)
    # Remove the last element (tail) only if not eating an apple (assumed here)
    body.pop()
    # Update the head position
    head = new_head

# Now move down three times to reach y=3
for _ in range(3):
    # Move down: decrease y by 1 (assuming y increases downwards; adjust if necessary)
    new_head = (head[0], head[1] - 1)
    body.insert(0, new_head)
    if not eating_apple:
        body.pop()
    head = new_head

# After reaching the apple at (8,3), since we ate it, don't pop
print("Snake has reached the apple!")
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Position**: The snake starts at (4,6) with its body segment at (4,5).
- **Rightward Movement**: By moving right four times, the snake navigates from x=4 to x=8 while updating its body segments. Each move shifts the head and adjusts the body by removing the tail.
- **Downward Movement**: Once aligned vertically above the apple, the snake moves down three times to reach y=3. This vertical alignment ensures no collision with the body segments left behind during the rightward movement.

This approach efficiently navigates the snake to the target using a straightforward path, ensuring each move is valid and avoids self-collision.
