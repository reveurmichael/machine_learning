You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to help this user who's playing a classic Snake game on a 10x10 grid. The snake starts at position (2,4) with a direction of "DOWN," and there are some body cells provided. The goal is to plan a safe path for the head to reach the apple at (7,2). 

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (2,4), which means x=2 and y=4. The body segments are [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]. So looking from the head backwards, the snake's body goes up to (2,5) as the first segment behind, then (3,5), followed by (4,5), and ends with the tail at (4,6). 

The apple is located at (7,2), which is quite some distance away. To get there, the snake needs to move primarily to the right since the x-coordinate increases from 2 to 7, a difference of 5 units. In terms of y-coordinates, it's moving down because 4 to 2 is two steps down.

I also notice that in each move, when the snake doesn't eat the apple, its body shifts forward by one segment. So, if it moves towards the apple and grows, the tail stays; otherwise, the last segment (tail) is removed. 

The key here is to plan a path that avoids self-collisions. The head must not move into any of the body segments except when growing at the apple's position. Also, since the snake has body cells in certain areas, it needs to navigate around them without getting stuck.

Looking at the current direction, which is "DOWN," moving further down could potentially block progress towards the apple if the path isn't clear. Maybe turning right or left would be necessary to avoid obstacles and create a clear path ahead.

Another consideration is that after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn. So the final step before reaching the apple shouldn't trap the snake. 

I should also calculate how many steps are needed in each direction. The x-distance from 2 to 7 is 5, so moving right five times would get us closer. However, we need to adjust for the y-coordinate as well since we're starting at a higher y and need to go lower.

Since the snake's current body blocks some paths, perhaps moving diagonally isn't possible without overlapping with itself. So, it might be better to handle each direction step by step, ensuring that each move doesn't cause a collision.

I should also check for any potential self-collisions during the movement. For example, if the head moves right multiple times before turning down, I need to make sure that those steps don't overlap with other body segments except when necessary.

Another point is that since the snake's body is in specific positions, it's important not to move into areas where the next body segment would cause an immediate collision. For instance, moving directly down from (2,4) might land on a position already occupied by one of the body segments unless we account for the shifting.

I think starting with right turns first since that's the primary direction towards the apple. After each move, I'll check if it causes any collisions and adjust accordingly.

In summary, the plan should be to head mostly to the right while occasionally turning down or left to avoid self-collisions and create a clear path for reaching the apple without getting stuck in the future.

"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake moves primarily to the right (5 steps) and then down (3 steps) to reach the apple, avoiding any self-collisions. This path ensures that each segment of the body remains clear and the snake does not trap itself."

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5)], to eat the apple at (7, 2).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
