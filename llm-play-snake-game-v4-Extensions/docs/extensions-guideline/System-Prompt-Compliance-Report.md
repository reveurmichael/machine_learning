# System Prompt Compliance Report

## Overview

This document verifies that **ALL** critical requirements from the system prompt have been properly implemented and enforced across the entire codebase. The project successfully maintains Task-0 (LLM Snake Game) as the first-class citizen while providing a robust foundation for all future tasks through proper refactoring, OOP principles, and architectural compliance.

## ✅ Critical Requirements Status

### 1. **Documentation as First Priority and First Class Citizen**

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT**

- **Extensive Documentation**: All major components have comprehensive docstrings with design pattern explanations
- **Docstring Quality**: Every class, method, and module includes detailed documentation explaining purpose, design patterns, and usage
- **Design Pattern Documentation**: Each design pattern used is thoroughly documented with motivation, philosophy, and trade-offs
- **Comments**: Critical architectural decisions are well-documented in code comments


### 2. **Task-0 Functionality Preservation**

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT**

- **Task-0 Unchanged**: All Task-0 (LLM Snake Game) functionality remains intact. Existing Task-0 scripts and workflows continue to work. No touch to Task-0 code.
- **Base Class Pattern**: Task-0 classes inherit from base classes without functionality loss
- **Output Schema Preserved**: Game logs still follow the original JSON schema format

**Validation:**
- Existing log files in `logs/hunyuan-t1-latest_20250617_223807/` maintain correct schema
- Task-0 can still generate valid game sessions and summaries

### 3. **Project Structure Alignment**

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT**

- **Follows `project-structure-plan.md`**: Directory structure matches planned layout
- **First vs Second Citizens**: Clear separation maintained
- **Extensions Structure**: Proper versioning (v0.01, v0.02, v0.03, v0.04)
- **Common Folder**: Shared utilities properly placed in `extensions/common/`

### 4. **Single Source of Truth** TODO: maybe this one is not fully accomplished yet. Make sure we have a single source of truth for all code across all extensions.

What we want to have:
- **Configuration Centralized**: All constants in `config/` and `extensions/common/config.py # TODO or maybe a /extensions/common/config/ folder?`
- **No Duplication**: Shared logic lives in common modules
- **Cross-Extension Independence**: Each extension + common is standalone
- **Versioned Directory Manager**: Single implementation for all directory structure needs

### 5. **OOP, SOLID and DRY Principles**

What we want to have: # TODO: make sure this is accomplished 100%

**Design Patterns Implemented:**
- **Factory Pattern**: Agent creation across all extensions
- **Singleton Pattern**: FileManager and directory managers # TODO: or maybe other classes should be singletons?
- **Strategy Pattern**: Algorithm selection and model frameworks
- **Template Method**: Base classes with extension hooks
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interfaces for complex systems
- **Adapter Pattern**: Integration between different components

**SOLID Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has clear, focused purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensions inherit from base classes without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: All extensions properly substitute base class behavior
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Extensions depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 6. **Class Naming Convention**

This is what we want to have:
- **Root Classes**: Simple names (GameController, FileManager, GameData)
- **Base Classes**: Prefixed with "Base" (BaseGameManager, BaseFileManager)
- **Extension Classes**: Prefixed with algorithm type (HeuristicGameManager, MLGameManager)
- **No Task0 Prefixes**: Clean naming without unnecessary prefixes in root

### 7. **Singleton Pattern Implementation**

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT**

- **BaseFileManager**: Implements Singleton pattern
- **FileManager**: Implements Singleton pattern
- TODO: maybe other classes should be singletons?
- **Proper Documentation**: All singleton implementations thoroughly documented

### 8. **Forbidden Code Pollution**

TODO: This is what we want to have (hence I am not sure if it is fully accomplished yet):
**Verified No Pollution:**
- **No Heuristics Terms**: Words like "heuristics", "reinforcement learning" absent from ROOT
- **No ML Terms**: Machine learning terminology restricted to extensions
- **Clean ROOT**: Task-0 code remains focused on LLM gameplay
- **Forbidden Imports**: Zero violations of forbidden import patterns

**Validation Results:**
```bash
# No forbidden import patterns found
find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "from heuristics_v0\.0[1-4] import" {} \;
find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "from blablabla_v0\.0[1-4] import" {} \;
# Returns: empty (✅ COMPLIANT)
```

### 9. **No Over-Preparation**

WHAT SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED:
- **Task-0 Focus**: Only implements what Task-0 actually uses
- **No Unused Code**: No unimplemented functions prepared for future tasks
- **Clean Base Classes**: Base classes contain only what Task-0 needs
- **Future Tasks**: Will implement their own specific requirements, but reusing the same base classes and config as much as possible.

### 10. **Core/Replay Class Preservation**

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT**

- **No Removals**: All classes in `./core/` and `./replay/` preserved
- **Extensions Only**: Only additions and extensions made
- **Extension Usage**: Extensions actively use these classes
- **Inheritance Maintained**: Proper inheritance chains established

### 11. **Agent Folder Evolution Preservation**

TODO: This is what we want to have:
**Verified Preservation:**
- `extensions/heuristics-v0.02/agents/`: Ideally, should be the same as in v0.02, v0.03, v0.04, but with some changes.
- `extensions/heuristics-v0.03/agents/`: Ideally, should be the same as in v0.02, v0.03, v0.04, but with some changes.
- `extensions/heuristics-v0.04/agents/`: Ideally, should be the same as in v0.02, v0.03, v0.04, but with some changes.
- `extensions/supervised-v0.02/`: Structure preserved
- `extensions/reinforcement-v0.02/`: Structure preserved

**Standalone Verification:**
- Each extension + common folder forms standalone unit
- No cross-extension dependencies
- Clear version evolution demonstration

### 12. **Common Folder Architecture**

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT**

- **Shared Utilities**: Common code properly placed in `extensions/common/`
- **No Cross-Extension Sharing**: Extensions share via common only
- **Standalone Principle**: Extension + common = standalone
- **Conceptual Clarity**: Extension-specific concepts remain visible (# TODO:very very important, very very much visible because we want to learn things just by looking at the code of each extension and each of its version, without even going to the common folder, because common stuffs are just too common, that's why it's named "common")

### 13. **Type Hints**

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT**

- **Selective Type Hinting**: Only where genuinely useful and accurate
- **No Over-Hinting**: Avoided type hints for the sake of typing
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on meaningful type annotations
- **Function Signatures**: Important functions properly typed

### 14. **Forbidden Import Patterns**

TODO: This is what we want to have:

**Zero Violations Found:**
- No `from heuristics_v0.01 import` patterns
- No `from heuristics_v0.02 import` patterns  
- No `from heuristics_v0.03 import` patterns
- No `from supervised_v0.0N import` patterns
- No `from reinforcement_v0.0N import` patterns
- No `from blablabla_v0.0N import` patterns

**Validation Method:**
- Comprehensive grep searches across entire codebase
- Results: Clean (no forbidden patterns detected)

### 15. **Version Compatibility**

TODO: This is what we want to have:

- **v0.02 → v0.01**: No breaking changes
- **v0.03 → v0.02**: No breaking changes, just adding streamlit app.py and dashboard folder for launching scripts in the scripts folder, with adjustable params, with subprocess.; also, for adding replay capabilities with PyGame and Flask Web.
- **v0.04 → v0.03**: No breaking changes (heuristics only, just making agents exporting jsonl files so that those output files can be used in LLM-Fine-Tuning and maybe distillation)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each version builds upon previous

### 16. **Grid-Size Directory Structure (VITAL)**

TODO: This is what we want to have:

**Mandatory Structure Enforced:**
```
logs/extensions/
├── datasets/grid-size-N/extension_v0.0M_timestamp_or_maybe_blablabla_folder_or_sub_or_subsub_folders_or_file_whose_naming_is_not_decided_yet # TODO: check this, update blablabla. #TODO: check this, update blablabla.
└── models/grid-size-N/extension_v0.0M_timestamp_or_maybe_blablabla_folder_or_sub_or_subsub_folders_or_file_whose_naming_is_not_decided_yet # TODO: check this, update blablabla. #TODO: check this, update blablabla.
```

TODO: but I have a lot of questions and hesitations about how we should organize the things within datasets/grid-size-N/extension_v0.0M_timestamp/ and within models/grid-size-N/extension_v0.0M_timestamp/  . We should have a serious discussion about this. This is very important. Fundamentally important. Because it will have such a huge impact on the whole all extensions.

**Implementation:**
- **Centralized Management**: `VersionedDirectoryManager` in common # TODO: make sure; also, this one maybe be code changed in the future, depending on our discussion results about the datasets/grid-size-N/extension_v0.0M_timestamp/ and within models/grid-size-N/extension_v0.0M_timestamp/  origanization.
- **Validation System**: `scripts/validate_grid_size_compliance.py` # TODO: maybe a validation folder because we have a lot of validation to do?
- **Zero Violations**: All extensions comply with grid-size structure
- **Dynamic Paths**: No hardcoded grid-size-10 references


### 17. **Comprehensive Documentation**

TODO: before changing this line to "**STATUS: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT**", we should make sure it's really 100% accomplished. Anyways, this is what we want to have:

**Documentation Coverage:**
- **Philosophy Documents**: Versioned directory structure philosophy
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive function and class documentation
- **Design Pattern Explanations**: Each pattern thoroughly documented
- TODO: what else important documentation we need?
- TODO: not only documentation, but also comments, and docstrings.

## 🎯 Architectural Achievements

### Design Pattern Implementation

1. **Factory Pattern**: Agent creation across all extensions, TODO:maybe other classes should be factories?
2. **Singleton Pattern**: File and directory management  # TODO: maybe other classes should be singletons?
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Algorithm and model selection
4. **Template Method**: Base class extension hooks
5. **Facade Pattern**: Simplified complex system interfaces #TODO: where is it used?
7. **Adapter Pattern**: Cross-system integration # TODO: where is it used? is it justified? since we want to have a lot of standalones in the extensions. But maybe adapter pattern can be used for MVC adapting GameData or GameController stuffs, jut maybe.

### SOLID Principles Adherence

### Educational Value

- **Progressive Complexity**: v0.01 → v0.02 → v0.03 → v0.04 evolution
- **Design Pattern Exhibition**: Multiple patterns demonstrated

- **Scientific Rigor**: Proper experimental organization

## 📋 Continuous Compliance

**Monitoring Tools:**
- `scripts/validate_grid_size_compliance.py`: Automated structure validation # TODO: maybe a validation folder because we have a lot of validation to do? And we should, indeed, continously validate whether things are compliant with what we want to have.
- Comprehensive documentation for ongoing maintenance
- Clear architectural principles for future development
- Established patterns for extension development
