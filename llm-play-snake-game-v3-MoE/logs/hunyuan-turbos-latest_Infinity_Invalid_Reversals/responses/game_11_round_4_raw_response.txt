========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move down four times to reach the apple at (5,5) from (5,9). The current direction is 'UP', so the first move must not be 'DOWN' (reversal), but since the snake's body is only at (5,8), moving 'DOWN' from (5,9) to (5,8) would collide with the body. Thus, the first move must be 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT', but those would not help reach the apple. However, the problem allows returning as many initial safe moves as possible. The only safe initial move is 'DOWN' (even though it seems to collide, the body is at (5,8) and the head is at (5,9), so moving 'DOWN' to (5,8) would collide. Wait, this is a problem. Let's re-examine: the head is at (5,9), body at (5,8). Moving 'DOWN' to (5,8) would collide with the body. So 'DOWN' is invalid. Next possible moves are 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'. Moving 'LEFT' to (4,9) is safe (no body there), and moving 'RIGHT' to (6,9) is also safe. But neither helps reach the apple. Thus, no safe path exists from the current state."
}
```

Wait, the above reasoning seems incorrect. Let's re-analyze:

The snake's head is at (5,9), body at (5,8). The apple is at (5,5). The snake needs to move down 4 times to reach the apple. But the current direction is 'UP', so the first move cannot be 'DOWN' (reversal). The only other options are 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT', but those don't help reach the apple. Thus, no safe path exists from the current state.

But the problem says: "If you cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple, output as many initial moves as you are confident are safeâ€”even if it's just one." But in this case, no initial move is safe because 'DOWN' is invalid (reversal and collision), and 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' don't help reach the apple. So the correct output is:

```json
{
  "moves": [],
  "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND"
}
```

But let's think again: the snake's body is only at (5,8), and the head is at (5,9). The first move cannot be 'DOWN' (reversal and collision). 'LEFT' to (4,9) is safe, but doesn't help reach the apple. 'RIGHT' to (6,9) is safe, but doesn't help reach the apple. So no safe path exists.

Final answer:

```json
{
  "moves": [],
  "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND"
}
```
