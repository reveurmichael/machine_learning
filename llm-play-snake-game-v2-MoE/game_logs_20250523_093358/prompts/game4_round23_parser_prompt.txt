You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
I'll need to use Python's json module to generate the required response.

Let me analyze the current state and plan the path:

Current head position: (6, 6)
Apple position: (8, 8)

Since we're moving from (6, 6) to (8, 8), I need:
- 2 RIGHT moves
- 2 UP moves

Also, I need to avoid collisions with the snake's body [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)] and ensure we don't run into walls.

Let me first check if there are any potential obstacles on this path:

1. Moving RIGHT:
- (7, 6) is not in the body
- (8, 6) is not in the body

2. Moving UP:
- (6, 7) is not in the body
- (6, 8) is not in the body

Let me use Python to plan this path:

```python
import json

# Current state
head = (6, 6)
apple = (8, 8)
body = [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)]
direction = "UP"

# Plan moves
moves = []
current_position = head

while current_position != apple:
    x, y = current_position

    # Check if we can move RIGHT to reach apple
    if x < apple[0] and (x+1, y) not in body and (x+1, y) != (9, 9):
        moves.append("RIGHT")
        current_position = (x+1, y)
    # Check if we can move UP to reach apple
    elif y < apple[1] and (x, y+1) not in body and (x, y+1) != (9, 9):
        moves.append("UP")
        current_position = (x, y+1)
    else:
        # No valid path found
        break

# Check if we've reached the apple
if current_position == apple:
    result = {
        "moves": moves,
        "reasoning": f"Direct path from {head} to {apple} avoiding body segments"
    }
else:
    result = {
        "moves": [],
        "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND"
    }

print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)], to eat the apple at (8, 8).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
