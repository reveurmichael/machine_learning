{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move DOWN 5 times (from y=6 to y=1) and LEFT 2 times (from x=9 to x=7). Each DOWN move shifts the body upward, avoiding collisions. After reaching (9,1), moving LEFT twice reaches the apple at (7,1). These moves are safe as they avoid body segments and stay within grid bounds, with a legal move available after eating the apple."
