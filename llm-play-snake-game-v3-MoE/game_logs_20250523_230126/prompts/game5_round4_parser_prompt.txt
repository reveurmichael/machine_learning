BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, so I need to plan a path for my snake in the Snake game. The snake's head is at (5,6), and the apple is at (4,4). The snake's body cells are given as [(6,6)], which means it has only one segment besides the head. Hmm, that seems like a problem because normally, a snake would have multiple segments to move around without getting stuck.

Wait, the snake's S is [HEAD, BODY1], and the provided list is just the first segment. So actually, I think the body consists of two cells: (6,6) and maybe another one behind the head? Or am I misunderstanding something here? Let me read the problem statement again.

Oh, wait, no. The problem says "The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN]". So each body segment is adjacent to the previous. In this case, it's given as [(6,6)] for the body cells from behind the head. That means the snake has two segments: (5,6) at the head and (6,6), so it's just a 2-segment snake. That might make things easier because I don't have to worry about multiple segments causing possible collisions.

So, with only two body parts, the snake is just moving in straight lines or maybe turning slightly. The apple is at (4,4). Let me think about how the snake can reach there without hitting anything.

The movement rules say that when facing a direction, the new head is computed and checked against the existing body except for the tail's current position if it doesn't move. So, since I'm not eating the apple yet, I shouldn't be concerned with removing the tail unless I do.

First, let me figure out the possible directions. The snake can move in any direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE (if moving straight). But according to rule 1, if it's moving "NONE", the first move is allowed.

Since the snake has only two body segments, I need to plan a path that moves towards the apple without colliding. The head is at (5,6), and the apple is at (4,4). Let me see the Manhattan distance: x difference is 1, y difference is 2. So moving diagonally or something?

Wait, no. Because each move changes either x or y by 1. To get from (5,6) to (4,4), I need a total change of (-1, -2). That could be two moves: first go left and down twice, but the snake's body might block that.

Alternatively, maybe it can take three steps if it turns around, but since there are only two segments, perhaps it can move straight towards or in some other way.

Let me try to map out possible directions. The snake is at (5,6). If I go RIGHT to (6,6), then the tail would be moving to (5,6) next turn. Wait, no: if I'm moving right, new_head becomes (6,6), but that's already occupied by the previous tail? Or not?

Wait, the body cells list is [(6,6)], so after the snake moves right, the old head (5,6) would become the first element of the new body. The old tail was at (4,6)? Wait, no, because if I'm at (5,6), moving right to (6,6). The previous position is (5,6). So the new head is (6,6), and the old head (5,6) becomes part of the new body. But wait, in a 2-segment snake, each step only has two segments.

Wait, maybe I'm confused. If there are only two body parts, the snake's S would be [HEAD, BODY1], where BODY1 is adjacent to HEAD. So if the snake moves right, new_head is (6,6), and the old head becomes part of the new body. So the new S is [(6,6) at front, and the previous tail was at (5,6)], but wait that's only one cell.

Wait no, I think I need to represent the snake as a list where each step is added or removed based on movement. Let me re-express the problem: the snake has S = [HEAD, BODY1], with body cells [(6,6)] being BODY1 and maybe another cell behind the head?

Wait, perhaps the given body cells are for the segments from the body behind the head to the tail. So in this case, there's only one segment (6,6), which is behind the head at (5,6). That would make the snake two segments: HEAD (5,6) and (6,6).

So when moving right, new_head is (6,6). Now, we have to check if that collides with any body cells except the tail's next position. The old tail was at (4,6), but wait no: in a two-segment snake, each segment moves one step relative.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the snake has only two segments, perhaps it can move directly to the apple without any issues because there are fewer body parts to collide with.

Let me try moving right three times:

1. Move right: new_head is (6,6). No collision except if (6,6) is already in body. But body was [(5,6)]? Wait no, the initial S has [HEAD, BODY1], where BODY1 is (6,6). So when moving right, the snake's head is now at (6,6), and the old head (5,6) becomes part of the new body. The tail would be (4,6)? Or not?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe each move only changes one segment. Let me think again.

The snake's S is [HEAD, BODY1], which are adjacent segments. Each step, the HEAD moves and the next segment follows.

So when moving right: new_head = (5+1,6) = (6,6). The old head was (5,6), so it's removed from the body. The new body is [(6,6)]. Then, if I don't eat the apple, I have to check for collisions with other body segments except the tail.

In this case, after moving right, the snake's body is [ (6,6) ]. So the only position that would collide is if the next segment in front of me steps into (5,6), but since it's not part of the body, I think it's safe. Wait no: because when the snake moves, each new body position is added to the front.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between current and future positions. Let me break it down step by step.

Current S: [ (5,6), (6,6) ]

Move right:

- new_head = (6,6)
- The old_head was (5,6), which is removed from the body.
- Now, the new body is [(6,6)]
- Check if new_head is outside grid? No.

Check for collision: For each segment in S except the tail's current position, see if new_head coincides. But since there's only one segment (body1 is now at (6,6)), and it's a 2-segment snake, I think after moving right, as long as the head doesn't move outside or into the same cell as any other body part, it's safe.

But in this case, new_head is (6,6), which was previously at (5,6). But the old tail was at (4,6) maybe? Or not?

Wait, I'm getting confused about where the old body segments are. Let me clarify: the snake has two segments, so each segment moves in a straight line or turns.

In this case, when moving right, the new_head is (6,6). The old head was (5,6), which becomes part of the new body. The next segment, if any, would move accordingly. But since it's a 2-segment snake, perhaps after moving right once, I have to check if (6,6) is in the body except for the tail.

Wait no: because each move only changes one segment. So when you move right, your new_head becomes (6,6), and that's part of the new body. The previous head was gone, and the next segment would be at (5,6). But since I didn't eat the apple, that's fine.

But wait, in this case, after moving once to (6,6), where is the old tail? It was at (4,6) maybe, but now it's part of the body. So perhaps I don't have any collision here because only my new_head is there and no other body parts are overlapping.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think: from (5,6), moving right to (6,6). The snake's body is now [ (6,6) ]. So the head is at (6,6), and the tail was previously at (4,6). But since it's a 2-segment snake, after moving right once, I don't have any collision because only my new_head is there.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you move right, your body part behind could potentially collide with another segment if the movement causes them to be in the same cell. But since it's a 2-segment snake, moving straight ahead without turning might be okay.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try moving "UP" first and see where that leads me. Let's map out both possibilities.

Option 1: Move RIGHT three times:

- After first right: S = [ (5,6), (6,6) ] → move to (6,6)
- After second right: (7,6). But this is outside the grid since y ranges from 0 to 9. So that's invalid.

Option 2: Move RIGHT once and then DOWN:

From (5,6) → RIGHT → (6,6), then DOWN → (6,5).

But wait, let me check for collisions after each move.

After moving right to (6,6):

- new_head is (6,6)
- old_head was (5,6) which is now part of the body.
- The next segment would be at (4,6), but that's not in the body yet. So no collision except if any other body parts are in the same cell.

Wait, the current S after moving right once is [ (5,6), (6,6) ] → new_head is (6,6). But since I'm moving straight ahead, and assuming each segment moves forward one step, but in this case, it's just a 2-segment snake. So no collision here.

Then, if I don't move down yet, can I then move DOWN to (6,5):

- new_head would be (6,5). Now, I need to check collisions with the body segments except the tail.

Body segments are [ (5,6), (6,6) ]. So my new_head is (6,5).

Do any of these positions coincide? 5,6 → no. 6,6 → no. 6,5 → also no.

But wait, when moving down from (6,6), I have to check if the new head is overlapping with anything else. Since it's not in the current body except the tail, which was previously at (4,6). Wait, but after moving right once, the snake's S becomes [ (5,6), (6,6) ], and then down would be (6,5). But since I'm only removing one segment each move, perhaps this is allowed.

Wait no: in reality, when you take a step, both the head and the next segment follow. So moving right from (5,6) to (6,6), which removes (5,6) and adds (6,6). Then, moving down would remove (6,6) and add (6,5). But wait that would result in overlapping at (6,6) being removed again.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider the problem differently: since the snake has only two body parts, maybe it's impossible to reach the apple without some other movement.

Alternatively, perhaps moving "UP" and then making a turn will allow me to reach the apple in three steps:

1. Move UP from (5,6) → (4,6). Now, S is [ (5,6), (4,6) ].
2. Then move RIGHT to (4,7).
3. Then move DOWN to (4,6).

Wait no, that doesn't get me anywhere.

Alternatively:

1. Move UP: new_head at (4,6).
   - Check if (4,6) is in the body. Current body is [ (5,6), (6,6) ].
   - So 4,6 is not in body except if it's the tail, but I haven't moved down yet.

2. Then move RIGHT to (4,7).
3. Move DOWN to (4,6).

Wait that brings me back to (4,6), which is where I was after moving UP, but then again, no collision.

This approach isn't working either.

Maybe the only way to reach the apple at (4,4) without colliding is by changing direction somehow.

Wait, perhaps if I move LEFT and DOWN:

From (5,6):

1. Move LEFT → (4,6)
2. Then DOWN → (4,5)
3. Then DOWN again? No, wait that would take me further away.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP and then LEFT?

Wait no: from (5,6), move UP to (4,6). Then move LEFT to (3,6). That doesn't help either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the solution is to move in a different way altogether. Let me try another approach.

Since the snake has two segments, maybe it's possible to reach the apple without any collisions by moving into a position that isn't directly adjacent but loops around or something.

Wait, from (5,6), if I go UP and then RIGHT, would that work? But each move only changes one segment. So first move UP: (4,6). Then, perhaps another move to the right?

But let me check for collisions after each step:

After moving UP to (4,6):

- S is [ (5,6), (4,6) ]
- Check if new_head (4,6) is outside? No.
- Are there any other body parts in same cell as (4,6)? The current body doesn't have that.

Then move RIGHT to (4,7). Now S becomes [ (5,6), (4,7) ].

Check collisions:

- New_head (4,7). Current body is [(5,6), (4,6)]. No collision except if any of these positions are same. 5,6 → no. 4,6 → not in new_head. So okay.

Then move DOWN to (4,6):

But wait, from (4,7) moving DOWN would take me to (4,6), which is already in the body as (4,6). But that's part of the previous segment after moving UP, so removing it would leave me with [(5,6)], and my new_head would be (4,6). Then check for collision: Is (4,6) present elsewhere? No, except if it was a body part.

Wait no, because in this case, the snake's S is [ (5,6), (4,7) ], then moving DOWN to (4,6):

- The old_head at (4,7) becomes the first element of the new body.
- The previous segment would be at (3,7), but that doesn't affect current.

Wait, no. After moving from [ (5,6), (4,7) ] down:

- New_head is (4,6).
- So S becomes [ (5,6), (4,7) ] → new_head (4,6). Now, check for collisions with body except the tail's current position.

The old tail was at (3,7)? Or not? Wait no: in a 2-segment snake, each move only affects one segment. So after moving down:

- The previous head is now part of the new body as [ (5,6), (4,7) ] → new_head is (4,6). The next segment would be at (3,7)? No, because you can't have three segments.

Wait this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to visualize the movement step by step for both directions.

Let me consider moving RIGHT first:

1. Move RIGHT from (5,6) → (6,6).
   - New_head: (6,6)
   - Check collision with existing body: [ (5,6), (6,6) ].
      - The new_head is (6,6), which was previously the second segment. So does that cause a collision? Because in a 2-segment snake, moving right would mean the head moves and the next segment follows.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Maybe the solution is to move "UP" three times?

But from (5,6):

- First UP → (4,6)
   - Check if collision: body has [(5,6), (6,6)]. 4,6 isn't in that.
   - But I'm not eating the apple yet. So continue.

- Second UP → (3,6). Now S is [ (5,6), (4,6) ]
   - Check for collision: body has [(5,6), (6,6)]. 3,6 isn't in that.
   - Continue.

- Third UP → (2,6)
   - S becomes [ (5,6), (3,6) ]
   - Check collision with body: no, because body is [ (5,6), (6,6) ].
      Wait but the new_head is at (2,6). The old head was (4,6), which would be part of the new body.

Wait no: in a 2-segment snake, each move only affects one segment. So moving up again from (5,6):

- S becomes [ (5,6), (4,6) ]
- Then moving UP → (3,6)
   - Now S is [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ] ?

Wait no: a 2-segment snake can only have two segments. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows for any number of segments as long as they are adjacent and move in a straight line or turn one segment at a time.

But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try moving "UP" and then LEFT, but let me think:

From (5,6):

1. Move UP → (4,6)
2. Then move LEFT → (3,6)
3. Then DOWN → (3,7)

Wait no: from (3,6), DOWN to (3,7). But that's moving away.

Alternatively, after moving UP and LEFT:

From (5,6):

1. Up → (4,6)
2. Left → (4,5)
   - Check for collision with body [ (5,6), (4,6) ]
      - new_head is (4,5). Not in the body except if it's a tail segment.

Wait, after moving up and left:

- S becomes [ (5,6), (4,6) ] → move UP to (4,6)
   - Now S is [ (5,6), (4,6) ]
   - Then LEFT to (4,5)
      - new_head is (4,5). Check if any body parts are here.
         Body after moving up: [(5,6), (4,6)]
         4,5 not in that. So okay.

Then move DOWN → (4,4)

Because from (4,5) moving DOWN is (4,4).

So the path would be:

1. (5,6) → UP → (4,6)
2. (4,6) → LEFT → (4,5)
3. (4,5) → DOWN → (4,4)

Wait no: from (4,5), moving DOWN would take me to (4,4). But let me check:

- After step 1: S is [(5,6), (4,6)]
   - new_head is (4,6)
- Step 2: LEFT → (4,5)
   - Now body is [(5,6), (4,6)]
      - Check if any of these positions coincide with new_head (4,5).
         No, because [(5,6), (4,6)] do not include (4,5).
- Step 3: DOWN → (4,4)
   - new_head is (4,4)
   - Now S becomes [(5,6), (4,6), (4,4)]
      Wait no! Because from [ (5,6), (4,6) ], moving DOWN would add (4,4) as the next segment. But in reality, a 2-segment snake can only have two segments. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to adjust for that.

Alternatively, maybe after moving UP and LEFT, we end up with three body parts, but that's not possible because the problem states it's a snake with (n>1) segments.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Perhaps the key is that since there are more than one segment in the snake, the only way to get to the apple without collision is by moving "UP" and then making turns that allow looping back towards the apple.

But I'm not sure how to visualize it correctly.

Maybe a better approach is to consider all possible moves from (5,6) without any other segments. Since there are multiple segments, perhaps each movement affects only one segment at a time.

So maybe moving UP three times? Let's see:

1. Up → (4,6)
   - Check collision: body has [(5,6), (4,6)]
      - new_head is (4,6). Is this in the body except for the tail?
         The current body after step 1 is [ (5,6), (4,6) ], so (4,6) is already a segment. So that's okay.
   - No collision.

2. Up again → (3,6)
   - new_head is (3,6)
   - Check: body is [(5,6), (4,6)] → 3,6 not in that. Okay.

3. Up again → (2,6)
   - new_head is (2,6)
   - Check: same as above. Not in the body except if it's a tail segment.
      But after three ups, the snake has segments [5,6], [4,6], [3,6]. So no collision.

But then I need to move back towards the apple at (4,4). Maybe from (2,6), moving LEFT and then DOWN:

From (2,6):

- LEFT → (1,6)
   - Check: body is [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6)] → no collision.
   - new_head is (1,6).

- Then DOWN → (1,5)
   - new_head is (1,5). Now check:
      Body is [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]
         1,5 not in that. So okay.

Then from (1,5) moving LEFT and then UP:

But wait, the goal is at (4,4), so perhaps this isn't the path to take.

Alternatively, after moving UP three times from (5,6):

- S becomes [5,6], [4,6], [3,6], [2,6] → but I can only have two segments. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe my initial assumption about the number of segments is wrong. Maybe the snake has three segments in this problem because it's a longer snake.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The problem says: "You are to help solve the following"

But the problem gives (n>1) for the number of segments but doesn't specify how many. Wait, perhaps n is not given, so I need to find a solution regardless of the number of segments.

Wait no, looking again at the problem statement:

The starting point is given as (5,6). Then, in the path, you have S = (n>1) being the number of segments. So each segment is adjacent and can only move one square at a time. So perhaps the snake can turn corners.

But without knowing n, maybe it's not necessary to consider how many segments are used but rather find any possible direction that leads to (4,4).

Wait, given that the apple is at (4,4), which is one step below (5,6). But since I'm starting there, perhaps if I move DOWN once:

But from (5,6) moving DOWN would be (5,5), then maybe LEFT and UP again to reach (4,4):

1. Move DOWN → (5,5)
   - Check collision: body is [ (5,6), ... ] after that step.

But since I'm not eating the apple yet, perhaps this is allowed.

Then move LEFT → (5,4)
   - Check collision with [ (5,6) ], which doesn't conflict.
   
Then move UP → (5,3)
   - Check collision with [ (5,6), (5,5) ]? 5,3 not in that. So okay.

But this isn't moving towards the apple at (4,4). I'm getting lost here.

Wait perhaps a better approach is to find any possible path from (5,6) in one or more steps without colliding and reaching (4,4).

Let me think of a simple path:

1. From (5,6), move UP → (4,6)
   - Check collision: body is [(5,6), (4,6)] → new_head (4,6) would be in the same position as old_head if n>2.
      Wait no, because when moving from [ (5,6), (4,6) ], moving UP would add another segment at (4,6). But since we only have two segments, perhaps that's not allowed.

Wait this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the possibility of multiple segments and find a path with three segments that leads to the apple without collision.

For example:

1. From (5,6), move UP → (4,6)
   - new_head at (4,6). If body has [(5,6), (4,6)], then moving UP again would make another segment [3,6]. But since n>2, perhaps this is allowed.

Wait no: if the snake has more than two segments, it can move in a loop to reach back towards (4,4).

So for example:

1. Move UP → (4,6)
   - new_head at (4,6). Body is [(5,6), (4,6)]
      - Since n>2, this is allowed.
   
2. Then move LEFT → (4,5)
   - new_head at (4,5)
      - Body after moving up and left: [ (5,6), (4,6) ]
         4,5 not in that body. So okay.
   
3. Then move DOWN → (4,4)
   - new_head is (4,4). Now check collision:
      - Body before this move was [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]
         Because from step 1: [5,6], step2 left to [5,6], [4,6], [4,5]
      Wait no. Let me retrace:

After moving UP to (4,6):

- S is [(5,6), (4,6)]

Then move LEFT → (4,5)
   - Now body is [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]
   
Then move DOWN → (4,4)
   - new_head is (4,4)
      - Check if any body parts are in this position.
         Body after step 3: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]
         Wait no! Because moving from [ (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) ] and then moving DOWN to (4,4), the new_head is (4,4)
      - Now check if any existing body parts are at (4,4):
         No. So okay.

So total moves:

1. UP → (4,6)

2. LEFT → (4,5)

3. DOWN → (4,4)

Now, have I reached the apple?

Yes! Because from (5,6), moving UP to (4,6), then LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). So that's three moves.

But wait: after each move, do we need to check for collision with the previous positions? Or is it allowed because n>1, so multiple segments can be formed.

So if I have a snake with more than one segment, moving back and forth is possible without collision as long as new_head isn't overlapping any existing segment.

In this case, after three moves, we end up at (4,4), which is the apple. So that's a valid solution.
</think>

To solve this problem, start at position (5,6). The key is to move the snake in directions such that each new position doesn't overlap any existing segment of the snake. By making turns and moving in different directions, you can navigate back towards the apple at (4,4).

1. Move UP to (4,6).
2. Then LEFT to (4,5).
3. Finally, DOWN to reach (4,4), which is your target.

This path ensures that each move doesn't interfere with the snake's body, allowing you to reach the apple.

$\boxed{(4,4)}$
