<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the snake from (4,1) to the apple at (2,8). The current direction is DOWN, and the body segments are [(4,2), (4,3)]. Let's break this down.

First, the head is at (4,1). The apple is at (2,8), which is two units left and seven units up. So, I'll need to move LEFT twice and UP seven times in some order. But I have to consider the snake's movement rules and avoid collisions with its own body.

The current direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP because that would reverse the direction. Wait, no—the problem says you can't reverse directions immediately. So if it's currently going DOWN, the next move can't be UP. Similarly, LEFT can't be followed by RIGHT and vice versa. Since the current direction is DOWN, I have to choose from LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN again? Or wait, no—current direction is DOWN, so the available moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP.

Wait, looking back: The rules say you cannot reverse. So if current direction is DOWN, you can't go UP next. So first move options are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But from (4,1), moving DOWN would take it to (4,0). But the grid is 10x10, so y=0 is valid since 0 ≤ y < 10. Wait, but the head can't go into body segments except when eating apple. Let's see: The body is [(4,2), (4,3)]. So if I move DOWN from (4,1) to (4,0), does that collide with any body? No, because the body starts at (4,2). So it's safe.

But wait, the next move after moving DOWN would have to consider where the body moves. The snake is currently [HEAD(4,1), BODY1(4,2), BODY2(4,3)]. If I choose to go DOWN again, the new head becomes (4,0). Then, check collision: Is (4,0) in any body cells? No, because the body is from (4,2) onwards. So it's safe.

Then, after moving down, the body updates by adding the old head to the front of the body list. The body becomes [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple (apple is at (2,8)), the tail is removed. So the new body after moving down would be [(4,1), (4,2)].

But let's think about the overall strategy. The apple is two to the left and seven up. Maybe it's better to move LEFT first to get closer in x-coordinate before dealing with the y-coordinate.

So starting at (4,1):

First move options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

If I choose LEFT, new head would be (3,1). Check if this is safe. The body after moving would become [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] when we add the old head. Then, since not eating apple, tail (4,3) is removed. So body becomes [(4,1), (4,2)].

But wait, new_head is (3,1). Is this position occupied by any body cells except possibly the tail? The original body is [(4,2), (4,3)]. After moving LEFT, the new head is (3,1). None of the body segments are at (3,1), so it's safe.

So first move: LEFT to (3,1).

Next, I need to continue moving towards the apple. Since the current direction was DOWN but now we moved LEFT, the next possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT? Wait no—the current direction is now LEFT after moving. So next move cannot be RIGHT.

Wait, movement rules: each direction choice must not reverse the previous direction. So if I moved LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

So from (3,1), options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

I need to get closer to (2,8). So perhaps move UP as much as possible after getting into position.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first might block me later. Let's think step by step.

After first move: HEAD is at (3,1), body is [(4,1), (4,2)] because the tail was removed unless we ate an apple.

Next move: From (3,1). Current direction is LEFT, so next can't be RIGHT.

I need to decide between UP or DOWN. Let's see:

If I go UP from (3,1) to (3,2), check collision with body. The body after moving would be [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ] when adding the old head. Wait no—the body is updated by inserting the old head at front.

Wait, initial state before move: HEAD is (3,1). Body is [(4,1), (4,2)].

After moving UP to (3,2):

- Check collision: new_head (3,2) not in body except possibly when it's the tail. The body after inserting old head would be [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]. So (3,2) is not in any of these.

So safe to move UP.

Then, since we didn't eat apple, remove the last body segment (4,2). So new body becomes [(3,1), (4,1)].

Now HEAD is at (3,2).

Next direction: current direction was UP. So next move can't be DOWN.

I need to reach x=2 eventually. So perhaps continue moving LEFT if possible.

From (3,2):

Options: UP, LEFT, or DOWN (but wait, previous direction was UP, so can't choose DOWN now? Wait no—the rule is you can't reverse the direction. If current direction is UP, next can't be DOWN. But from (3,2), after moving UP to (3,3), what's the new direction? So if I moved UP again, then next move can't be DOWN.

But I need to get closer to x=2, so perhaps moving LEFT now.

From (3,2):

If I choose LEFT, new head is (2,2). Check collision: body after adding old head is [ (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ]. So (2,2) is not in the body. Safe.

Then, since not eating apple, remove tail (4,1). Body becomes [(3,2), (3,1)].

Now HEAD is at (2,2).

Next move: previous direction was LEFT, so can't choose RIGHT.

I need to go up towards y=8. So from (2,2), options are UP or DOWN. Let's pick UP.

Moving UP to (2,3):

Check collision: body after adding old head is [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ]. (2,3) not in body, so safe.

Not eating apple, so remove tail (3,1). Body becomes [(2,2), (3,2)].

Now HEAD at (2,3).

Next direction: UP again. So can't choose DOWN.

From (2,3):

Options: UP or LEFT (but moving left would take to x=1, which is further from the apple's x=2). Wait no—if I move UP again towards y=8.

So let's continue moving UP:

To (2,4), then (2,5), etc., until reaching y=8.

Wait, but I need to plan all moves. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. HEAD: (4,1), BODY: [(4,2), (4,3)], apple at (2,8). Current direction DOWN.
   - First move: LEFT to (3,1). Now HEAD is (3,1), BODY becomes [(4,1), (4,2)]. Tail removed.

Wait no—initially, the body is [(4,2), (4,3)], so after moving LEFT and updating:

- new_head = (3,1)
- Insert old head (4,1) at front of body: body becomes [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (4,3). So new body is [(4,1), (4,2)]

So after first move:

HEAD: (3,1)
BODY: [ (4,1), (4,2) ]

Wait, but that seems off. Because the initial body was behind the head.

Wait, in the problem statement, the body cells are ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the body is [(4,2), (4,3)], then after moving LEFT, the new head is (3,1). The old head (4,1) becomes the first body segment.

So after moving LEFT:

BODY = [ (4,1) ] + existing body except the last element? Or wait, no—the update step says insert old head at front of BODY list. So initial body is [(4,2), (4,3)]. After moving LEFT to (3,1), we add (4,1) to the front. Then remove the tail if not eating apple.

So:

new_body = [ (4,1) ] + existing_body = [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]

then, since new_head != apple position, remove last element: becomes [ (4,1), (4,2) ]

So HEAD is now (3,1), BODY is [(4,1), (4,2)].

Now, from (3,1):

Current direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.

Options: UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

Let's go UP to (3,2).

After moving UP:

- new_head = (3,2)
- Insert old head (3,1) into front of body: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]
- Remove last element since not eating apple: new_body is [ (3,1), (4,1) ]

So now HEAD is (3,2), BODY is [(3,1), (4,1)]

Current direction is UP.

Next move can't be DOWN.

From (3,2):

Options: UP or LEFT or RIGHT. But previous direction was UP, so next can't be DOWN.

Wait, no—if current direction is UP, next move can't be DOWN.

So from (3,2), options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.

But if we go LEFT again to x=2:

Move LEFT to (2,2).

After moving:

- new_head = (2,2)
- Insert old head (3,2) into front of body: [ (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ]
- Remove last element: new_body is [ (3,2), (3,1) ]

So now HEAD is (2,2), BODY is [(3,2), (3,1)].

Current direction is LEFT.

Next move can't be RIGHT.

From (2,2):

Options are UP or DOWN or LEFT again. Let's go UP.

Move to (2,3):

- new_head = (2,3)
- Insert old head (2,2) into front: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ]
- Remove last element: new_body is [ (2,2), (3,2) ]

So HEAD at (2,3), BODY [(2,2), (3,2)]

Current direction is UP.

Next move can't be DOWN. So from (2,3):

Options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

But we need to get to y=8, so let's continue moving UP.

Move UP to (2,4). Repeat until reach y=8.

This seems tedious, but each step would involve moving UP and checking that the new_head isn't in the body segments except possibly when it's the tail. But since we're adding the old head to the front, the body segments are behind us, so moving UP won't collide with any current body except if we loop around somehow.

Wait, but as we move up from (2,3) to (2,4), etc., each time adding the previous head to the front of the body. So for example:

After moving to (2,4):

BODY becomes [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ] before removing tail, then becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ]

So no collision.

Continuing this way, we can reach y=8 in 5 more moves: from (2,3) to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). That's five UP moves.

But wait, let's count how many steps:

From (2,3): need to move up 5 times to reach y=8.

So step sequence would be:

1. LEFT from (4,1) → (3,1)
2. UP → (3,2)
3. LEFT → (2,2)
4. UP → (2,3)
5. UP → (2,4)
6. UP → (2,5)
7. UP → (2,6)
8. UP → (2,7)
9. UP → (2,8)

So that's 9 moves.

But wait, after each move, the body is updated by adding the previous head to the front and removing the tail unless we eat an apple. Since we're not eating any apple until we reach it, but actually, when we reach (2,8), if that's where the apple is, do we eat it? The problem says when moving into the apple's position, so yes.

So when we move from (2,7) to (2,8):

- new_head = (2,8)
- Insert old head (2,7) to front of body. At that point, what's the body?

Before this last move:

After previous step at (2,7):

BODY was [ (2,6), (2,5), ... ] Wait no—each time we add the previous head.

Wait let's track it properly.

Starting after 4 moves:

1. Move LEFT: HEAD (3,1), BODY [(4,1), (4,2)]
2. Move UP: HEAD (3,2), BODY [(3,1), (4,1)]
3. Move LEFT: HEAD (2,2), BODY [(3,2), (3,1)]
4. Move UP: HEAD (2,3), BODY [(2,2), (3,2)]
5. Move UP: HEAD (2,4), BODY [(2,3), (2,2)]
6. Move UP: HEAD (2,5), BODY [(2,4), (2,3)]
7. Move UP: HEAD (2,6), BODY [(2,5), (2,4)]
8. Move UP: HEAD (2,7), BODY [(2,6), (2,5)]

Now move from (2,7) to (2,8):

- new_head = (2,8)
- Insert old head (2,7) into front of body: [ (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ]
- Since we are at apple position, do not remove tail. So body becomes [ (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ]

Thus, we have successfully eaten the apple.

But wait, is there any collision when moving into (2,8)?

The new head is (2,8). The body after inserting old head is [ (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ].

So (2,8) is not in any of these positions. So it's safe.

Thus, the total moves are 9: first LEFT, then UP, LEFT, and then five more UPs.

But let me think if this is optimal or if there's a better path with fewer moves. Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN initially to get further away from the body, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after moving LEFT once, maybe moving DOWN multiple times could allow for a different path. But probably the initial plan is fine.

So the sequence would be:

1. LEFT
2. UP
3. LEFT
4. UP ×5

But let's count them as separate moves.

Thus, the directions are: LEFT, UP, LEFT, and then five UPs. So total of 9 moves.

Wait, but after each move, the direction changes unless we continue in the same direction.

So from initial DOWN, can't go UP next if current direction is DOWN? Wait no—current direction is DOWN, so first move can be LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN again.

Wait, initial direction was DOWN. So first move options: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. I chose LEFT.

After that, the new direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT.

Then moved UP (new direction is UP), then LEFT again (direction is LEFT), etc.

So the directions in order would be:

1. LEFT
2. UP
3. LEFT
4. UP
5. UP
6. UP
7. UP
8. UP
9. UP

Wait, no—each move changes direction unless you continue straight.

But actually, each move's direction is determined by the chosen direction at that step. So after moving in a certain direction, the next can't be the reverse unless it's same as current.

So for example:

- After LEFT, can't go RIGHT next.
- After UP, can't go DOWN next.

Thus, to plan the moves efficiently, I need to choose directions that allow me to move towards the apple without getting blocked by my own body.

Another approach: Since the snake is initially in a vertical line (along y-axis at x=4), moving left once will put it at x=3. Then, perhaps moving up as much as possible until reaching y=8, then moving left again if needed.

But perhaps another path could be more efficient. Let me try to outline:

Alternative approach:

1. Move DOWN: from (4,1) → (4,0). Body becomes [(4,1), (4,2)], tail removed.
   - HEAD: (4,0)
   - BODY: [(4,1)]
2. Next move can't be UP. So options: LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN again.

But moving LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0):

- Check collision: body after adding old head (4,0): [ (4,0), (4,1) ]. New head is (3,0). Not in body.
   - So safe. Move LEFT.
   - HEAD: (3,0)
   - BODY becomes [(4,0), (4,1)] → after adding old head and removing tail, since not eating apple, new body is [ (4,0) ].

Wait no—the initial body after first move was [(4,1)]. After moving LEFT:

- Insert old head (4,0) at front: [ (4,0), (4,1) ]
- Remove last element: becomes [ (4,0) ]

So now HEAD is (3,0), BODY is [(4,0)].

Next move can't be RIGHT. So from (3,0):

Options: LEFT or DOWN or UP.

But we need to go towards the apple at (2,8). Maybe moving UP is better.

Move UP → (3,1).

After moving:

- Insert old head (3,0) into front of body [ (4,0) ] → [ (3,0), (4,0) ]
- Remove last element: new body is [ (3,0) ]

So HEAD at (3,1), BODY [(3,0)].

Next move can't be DOWN. So options: LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

Move UP again to (3,2):

- Insert old head (3,1): [ (3,1), (3,0) ]
- Remove last element: new body [ (3,1) ]

Continue moving UP until reach y=8.

From (3,1):

Moves:

5. UP → (3,2)
6. UP → (3,3)
7. UP → (3,4)
8. UP → (3,5)
9. UP → (3,6)
10.UP → (3,7)
11.UP → (3,8)

Now at (3,8). But the apple is at (2,8). So need to move LEFT.

Move LEFT → (2,8):

- Insert old head (3,8): [ (3,8), (3,7), ..., up to maybe earlier body]
Wait no—each time we add only the previous head. Let me track properly.

At step 11: HEAD is (3,8), BODY was [ (3,7) ].

After moving LEFT:

- new_head = (2,8)
- Insert old head (3,8) into front of body [ (3,7) ] → [ (3,8), (3,7) ]
- Since we are at apple position, don't remove tail. So new body is [ (3,8), (3,7) ]

But wait, the apple is eaten when moving into (2,8). So the body doesn't get updated with removing the tail because it's not a normal move.

Wait no—the apple eating happens regardless of direction; as long as you move into the apple's position. But in this case, from (3,8) to (2,8): new_head is (2,8). The body after inserting old head would be [ (3,8), (3,7) ].

Thus, it's safe because (2,8) isn't in the body.

But wait, is this path shorter? Let's count moves:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT
3. UP ×6 → up to (3,8)
4. LEFT

That's 9 moves as well.

So similar number of steps. Maybe first approach was better because it reached closer earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps a combination could be more efficient.

But regardless, the minimal number of moves is likely 7 or 8? Wait, let's think again.

Wait, from (4,1) to (2,8): Manhattan distance is |4-2| + |1-8| = 2+7=9. Since each move can cover one unit in a direction, minimal moves are 9 if no obstacles. But here, the snake's body can block itself, so may need more.

But perhaps with careful planning, it can be done in 9 moves.

In the first approach:

1. LEFT
2. UP
3. LEFT
4. UP ×5

That's 9 moves: L, U, L, U, U, U, U, U, U.

Alternatively, another sequence could be more efficient, but given the constraints of direction changes (can't reverse direction), it might not be possible to do better than 9.

So I think the minimal number of moves is 9.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple located at a different coordinate on a grid. The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), but it cannot reverse direction immediately after moving in another direction. Additionally, the snake's body blocks itself, so care must be taken to avoid collisions with its own segments.

### Approach
1. **Understand Movement Constraints**: The snake can only change direction by 90 degrees and cannot move in the opposite direction immediately after moving in the previous one. This constraint affects how we plan each move.
2. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**: Calculate the Manhattan distance between the snake's head and the apple to determine the minimum number of moves required without considering obstacles. The Manhattan distance is given by \( |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| \).
3. **Path Planning**: Plan a path that avoids self-collision by ensuring each move does not place the snake's new head position within its body segments.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the steps to navigate the snake to the apple without collision.

def main():
    import sys
    from collections import deque

    # Initial positions
    start = (4, 1)
    apple = (2, 8)

    directions = [ 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT' ]
    moves = []

    current_pos = start
    body = deque()
    body.append(current_pos)
    direction = None

    # Function to check if new position is safe
    def is_safe(new_pos):
        return new_pos not in body and (new_pos[0] >= 0 and new_pos[1] >= 0)

    # Move LEFT first
    current_dir = 'LEFT'
    moves.append(current_dir)
    new_pos = (current_pos[0] - 1, current_pos[1])
    if is_safe(new_pos):
        body.appendleft(body.popleft())
        current_pos = new_pos
        direction = current_dir

    # Move UP
    current_dir = 'UP'
    moves.append(current_dir)
    new_pos = (current_pos[0], current_pos[1] + 1)
    if is_safe(new_pos):
        body.appendleft(body.popleft())
        current_pos = new_pos
        direction = current_dir

    # Move LEFT again
    current_dir = 'LEFT'
    moves.append(current_dir)
    new_pos = (current_pos[0] - 1, current_pos[1])
    if is_safe(new_pos):
        body.appendleft(body.popleft())
        current_pos = new_pos
        direction = current_dir

    # Move UP five times to reach the apple
    for _ in range(5):
        current_dir = 'UP'
        moves.append(current_dir)
        new_pos = (current_pos[0], current_pos[1] + 1)
        if is_safe(new_pos):
            body.appendleft(body.popleft())
            current_pos = new_pos
            direction = current_dir

    print("Moves:", moves)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
The solution involves a series of moves to navigate the snake from its starting position (4,1) to the apple located at (2,8). The approach ensures that each move is safe and does not cause self-collision. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at (4,1).
2. **First Move**: The snake moves LEFT to (3,1) to start moving towards the apple.
3. **Second Move**: It then moves UP to (3,2) to begin navigating upwards.
4. **Third Move**: Another LEFT move brings it to (2,2), aligning it closer to the target column.
5. **Final Adjustments**: The snake continues moving UP five times to reach (2,8), where the apple is located.

This sequence ensures that each move avoids collisions with the snake's body and efficiently navigates towards the apple in 9 moves.
