{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right (2 steps) and up (6 steps) to reach the apple at (7,9). Starting with RIGHT avoids reversing direction and moves toward the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent UP moves incrementally approach the apple's y-coordinate while keeping the body aligned to avoid collisions. Each move checks for safety (no wall or body collisions), and after eating the apple, there are valid next moves (e.g., LEFT or RIGHT) to prevent trapping."
