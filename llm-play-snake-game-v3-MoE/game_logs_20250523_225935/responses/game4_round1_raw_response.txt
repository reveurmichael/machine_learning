========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out a path for the snake to move from (5,5) to (6,5). The snake's current direction is "NONE", which means it can choose any of the four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. The body list is empty, so this snake has only its head. That makes things easier because there are no other body segments blocking the path.

First, I should consider moving towards the apple at (6,5). Since both the head and the apple have the same y-coordinate, which is 5, the snake needs to move right once. So, if it moves RIGHT, the new head position will be (6,5), which is exactly where the apple is located.

I should check for any possible collisions before moving. Since the body list is empty, there's no other segment to collide with except possibly when the tail moves. But since this snake has only a head and no body behind it, moving RIGHT won't cause any collision issues because there's nothing in the way. 

Additionally, after eating the apple, I need to make sure that the snake can still move at least one more time without getting trapped. Since the snake is just a single segment now (after growing by one when it eats the apple), as long as it doesn't block itself completely, which isn't an issue here because there's only one segment.

So, moving RIGHT once should suffice to reach the apple safely without any collisions.

The snake can move right directly to reach the apple. Since the body is empty and there are no other segments to collide with, this path is safe.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving right from (5,5) leads directly to the apple at (6,5). There's a clear path as the snake has no body segments to block it."
}
```
