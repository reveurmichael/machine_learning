========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move DOWN 8 times to reduce y from 8 to 0, then LEFT once to reduce x from 1 to 0, reaching the apple at (0,0). Each DOWN move is safe as the head moves along x=1, avoiding the snake's body (which occupies x=2,3,4). The final LEFT move to (0,0) is also safe as the apple position is not occupied by the body."
