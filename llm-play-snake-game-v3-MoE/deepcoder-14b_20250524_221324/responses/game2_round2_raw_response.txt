<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to solve this Snake problem. So, the snake starts at (5,5) and needs to get to the apple at (6,8). The current direction is NONE, which means any move is allowed initially.

First, I'll map out the grid in my mind. The head is at (5,5), which is somewhere near the center of the 10x10 grid. The apple is at (6,8), so it's to the right and up from the head. That means I need a combination of RIGHT moves and some UP moves.

Since the snake starts with no body segments (the Body cells list is empty), that simplifies things because there are no immediate obstacles except for walls and potential future body positions after movement. But since the body is empty, I don't have to worry about it colliding with itself on the first few moves as long as I stay within the grid.

The apple is at (6,8). From (5,5), moving right once gets me to (6,5). Then I need to move up three times to reach y=8. So that would be RIGHT then UP three times: UP, UP, UP. That's a total of four moves: RIGHT, UP, UP, UP.

Wait, but I should check if this path is safe. Since the body starts empty and grows as we eat the apple, after each move, the body will add a segment unless we eat the apple. But in this case, since the initial body is empty, moving right once to (6,5) won't cause any collision because there's no body yet.

When I take the first step: RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5). Then, for each UP move, I need to ensure that after each movement, the new head doesn't collide with any existing body segments. But since the body is empty initially and only grows if we eat an apple, which isn't until we reach it, the path should be clear.

Wait, no. The apple is at (6,8). So when I move RIGHT to (6,5), that's not the apple yet. Then I need to move UP three times: from (6,5) to (6,6), then (6,7), then (6,8). But wait, moving up increases y by 1 each time because in the coordinate system, "UP" is y+1.

Wait no, according to the movement rules, "UP" means y increases. So from (5,5) moving RIGHT would take me to (6,5), then UP three times takes me to (6,8). That's correct.

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The initial head is at (5,5). Moving RIGHT once gets me to (6,5). Then, each UP move increases y by 1: from 5 to 6, then 7, then 8. So three UP moves after the RIGHT.

So the sequence would be RIGHT, then UP, UP, UP. That totals four moves: ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP"]. 

Wait no, wait. The first move is RIGHT, which takes me to (6,5). Then each subsequent UP move brings me up one step in y. So the total number of UP moves needed is 3 (from 5 to 8). So that's correct.

But I should also consider if after eating the apple, the snake doesn't get trapped. After eating the apple at (6,8), the body grows by one segment. Then, on the next move, there must be at least one valid direction to move without collision.

After reaching the apple, the head is at (6,8). The body would be [ (5,5) ] if we started with no body and moved once, but wait: initial body is empty. So let's track:

1. Initial state: head at (5,5), body is empty.
2. Move RIGHT to (6,5): new head is (6,5). Body was empty, so after moving, the body becomes [ (5,5) ] since we add the old head to the front and then remove the tail only if not growing. Wait no: when you move without eating an apple, you add the old head to the front of the body list and then remove the last element (the tail). But in this case, initial body is empty, so after moving, the body would be [ (5,5) ]? Or wait:

Wait, according to the movement update rules: when new_head != apple position, you insert old head at front of BODY (which was empty, so now it's [ (5,5) ]) and then remove the last element. But since the initial body is empty, after inserting, the body is [ (5,5) ], and then we remove the last element, which would be nothing because there's only one element. Wait no: wait, when you insert old head at front, the new body list becomes [old_head] + existing_body. Then, if not eating apple, you remove the last element.

Wait initial body is empty. So after moving, new_head is (6,5). The update steps:

a. Insert old head (5,5) to the front of BODY → BODY becomes [ (5,5) ].
b. Since new_head != apple (since we're at (6,5), which isn't the apple's position (6,8)), so we move normally: remove last element of BODY. But BODY is [ (5,5) ], so after removing, it's empty again.

Wait no: initial body is empty. After moving, the new head is (6,5). The old head was (5,5), which is added to the front of the body list (which was empty), making the body now [(5,5)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple (we're not at (6,8)), we remove the last element of the body. But the body is only one element, so after removing, the body becomes empty again.

So the new state is:

HEAD: (6,5)
BODY: empty

Wait that can't be right. Wait no: when you move, if it's a normal move (not eating apple), you add the old head to the front of the body list and then remove the last element. So initial body was empty.

After inserting old head (5,5) → body is [ (5,5) ].

Then, since new_head != apple, we proceed to step 3c: move normally, which means removing the last element of the body. But the body has only one element, so after removal, it's empty again. So the body remains empty.

Wait that seems odd, but I think that's correct. So each time you move without eating an apple, you add the old head to the front and remove the tail, keeping the length same.

But in this case, initial body is empty. After first move:

HEAD: (6,5)
BODY: [ (5,5) ] after inserting, then since not growing, we remove the last element (which is (5,5)), so BODY becomes empty again.

Wait no, wait. The movement update rules say:

After computing new_head and checking for collision (assuming no collision), step 3 says:

a. Insert old head at front of body list → new_body = [old_head] + existing_body.
b. If new_head == apple: grow by not removing tail.
c. Else: remove last element.

So in this case, initial body is empty.

After moving RIGHT:

new_head is (6,5).

Insert old_head (5,5) to front → new_body = [ (5,5) ] + [] = [ (5,5) ].

Since new_head != apple (it's not at 6,8), we proceed to step 3c: remove last element of body. The body is [ (5,5) ], so after removing the last element, it becomes empty again.

Wait no: wait, when you insert old head at front, the new body list is [old_head] + existing_body. Then, if not eating apple, you remove the last element (the tail). So in this case:

After inserting, body is [ (5,5) ].

Then, since we're not growing, we remove the last element of the body list. But the body list has only one element, which is (5,5), so after removal, the body becomes empty again.

So after first move, the body remains empty. That means the snake's body is just the head and no segments behind it, right?

Wait, but the initial state was:

HEAD: (5,5)
BODY: []

After moving RIGHT to (6,5):

- new_head = (6,5)
- old_head = (5,5) → added to front of body list, which was empty → body becomes [ (5,5) ].
- since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [] again.

So after the first move, the snake's full S is [ (6,5), ] with no body segments. That seems correct because without any body, it's just the head.

Wait no: wait, the movement example in the problem says that when you have a body and move normally, the body shifts. But if there are no body segments, then after moving, the body remains empty except for adding the old head but then immediately removing it.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the update rules. Let me re-examine them:

Movement Update Rules:
3. Update body positions (assuming no collision and within bounds):
   a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list.
   b. If new_head == apple position, grow: do not remove the tail this turn (BODY length increases by 1).
   c. Otherwise, move normally: remove the last element of BODY (the tail) so total length remains the same.

So when you have a body that's empty:

a. Insert old head → [old_head].
b. If new_head is not apple, then step 3c: remove last element → now body is empty again.

Wait but if initial body is empty and you insert old head at front, making it [old_head], and then since new_head != apple, you remove the last element (which is old_head), so body becomes empty again. So after each move without eating an apple, the body remains empty because you add one segment (the old head) but immediately remove it.

That seems odd, but perhaps that's correct for a snake with no initial body.

In any case, for our problem, since we're moving from (5,5) to (6,5), then up three times to reach (6,8). Each move after that would be similar: inserting the old head and then removing it unless we eat an apple.

Wait but wait: when you reach the apple at (6,8), what happens?

Let's track:

1. Initial state:
   - HEAD: (5,5)
   - BODY: []

2. Move RIGHT to (6,5):
   - new_head: (6,5)
   - old_head: (5,5) → added to front of body.
   - since not at apple (since (6,5) != (6,8)), remove last element (which is (5,5)) → BODY becomes empty.

3. Now, HEAD is (6,5), BODY is empty.

4. Next move: UP to (6,6).
   - new_head: (6,6)
   - old_head: (6,5) added to front of body.
   - since not at apple (6,6 != 6,8), remove last element → body becomes empty again.

Wait but this can't be right because the body would never grow unless we eat an apple. So until we reach the apple's position, the body remains empty after each move.

So when we finally reach the apple:

After moving from (6,7) to (6,8), which is the apple's position.

Let me track all steps up to that point:

Move 1: RIGHT → HEAD (6,5), BODY becomes [ (5,5) ] then removed → empty.
Move 2: UP → HEAD (6,6). BODY was empty. Insert old head (6,5) at front → [ (6,5) ]. Then since new_head != apple (6,6 != 6,8), remove last element → body becomes empty again.

Move 3: UP → HEAD (6,7). Insert old head (6,6) → body is [ (6,6) ]. Not at apple yet. Remove last element → body empty.

Move 4: UP → HEAD (6,8). Now, new_head == apple's position. So step 3b applies: do not remove the tail. Wait but initial body was empty. Let me see:

After move 4:
a. Insert old head (6,7) at front of current body (empty) → body becomes [ (6,7) ].
b. Since new_head == apple's position (6,8), we do not remove the tail. So body remains [ (6,7) ].

Wait no: wait, when you eat an apple, you insert old head at front and don't remove the last element. But initial body was empty before this move.

Wait, let me clarify:

Before this final move (move 4), HEAD is at (6,7). BODY is empty because after move 3, we added (6,6) to front but then removed it since we didn't eat an apple.

So during move 4:

- new_head: (6,8)
- old_head: (6,7)

Insert old head (6,7) at front of current body (which is empty). So now body is [ (6,7) ].
Since new_head == apple's position, we do not remove the last element. Wait no: step 3b says if new_head == apple, grow by NOT removing the tail. But in this case, after inserting old head at front, the body was empty, so it becomes [ (6,7) ]. Then since we ate the apple, we don't remove anything. So the final body is [ (6,7) ].

Wait no: wait, initial body before move 4 was empty because after move 3, we added (6,6) but then removed it. Wait no:

Wait let's track each step carefully:

Initial state:
HEAD: (5,5)
BODY: []

After Move 1 (RIGHT):
- new_head: (6,5)
- old_head: (5,5) → added to front of body → [ (5,5) ]
- since not at apple, remove last element → BODY becomes empty.

So after move 1:
HEAD: (6,5)
BODY: []

Move 2 (UP):
- new_head: (6,6)
- old_head: (6,5) added to front of body (empty) → [ (6,5) ]
- since not at apple, remove last element → BODY becomes empty.

After move 2:
HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: []

Move 3 (UP):
- new_head: (6,7)
- old_head: (6,6) added to front of body (empty) → [ (6,6) ]
- since not at apple, remove last element → BODY becomes empty.

After move 3:
HEAD: (6,7)
BODY: []

Move 4 (UP):
- new_head: (6,8)
- old_head: (6,7) added to front of body (empty) → [ (6,7) ]
- since new_head == apple's position, we do not remove the last element. So body remains [ (6,7) ].

So after move 4:
HEAD: (6,8)
BODY: [ (6,7) ]

Now, the snake has a body segment at (6,7). On the next move, if any, we would need to ensure that moving doesn't cause collision with this body segment. But since we're done (we've reached the apple), perhaps no further moves are needed.

But according to the problem, we just need to reach the apple, so the sequence of moves is:

RIGHT, UP, UP, UP → i.e., RIGHT followed by three UPs.

Wait but wait: from (5,5) moving RIGHT once gets us to (6,5), then each UP increases y by 1. So after four moves, we'd be at (6,8).

But I think the correct sequence is:

Move 1: RIGHT → (6,5)
Move 2: UP → (6,6)
Move 3: UP → (6,7)
Move 4: UP → (6,8)

So that's four moves in total. Alternatively, sometimes people count the number of steps rather than the number of moves, but I think here each move is a single step.

Wait no: no, each "move" corresponds to one step. So moving RIGHT once takes you from x=5 to x=6 (same y), then each UP moves y by 1.

So total moves needed:

RIGHT, UP, UP, UP → four moves in total.

But wait, let me check if this is the minimal number of moves or if there's a shorter path. From (5,5) to (6,8): right once and up three times is indeed the shortest path.

Alternatively, could you move up first? But that would require more steps because you'd have to go back down, which isn't possible since moving down would take y below 5 again, but that's not needed here. So no, moving right then up is the most efficient.

Another consideration: after eating the apple at (6,8), the body is now [ (6,7) ] and the head is at (6,8). On the next move, if any were required, we'd have to ensure that we don't collide with our own body. But since we've reached the target, perhaps no further moves are needed.

Also, I should check whether moving in this sequence would cause any collision before reaching the apple.

After each move:

1. RIGHT: HEAD (6,5), BODY empty → no collision.
2. UP: HEAD (6,6), BODY empty → no collision.
3. UP: HEAD (6,7), BODY empty → no collision.
4. UP: HEAD (6,8), BODY [ (6,7) ].

Wait but after move 4, the body is at (6,7). So when we're at (6,8), our body is only that one segment. If we were to make another move, say DOWN from (6,8) to (6,7), that would collide with our own body because the head would be moving into (6,7) where the body is.

But since we've reached the apple and presumably finished, that's not an issue here.

So yes, the sequence of moves should work without any collision issues before reaching the apple.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves required is four: RIGHT followed by three UPs.
</think>

The optimal path to reach the apple at (6,8) from (5,5) involves moving right once and then up three times. This ensures no collisions with the body since it starts empty and only grows after reaching the apple.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake's head is at (5,5), with an empty body.
2. **Move RIGHT:** 
   - New position: (6,5)
   - Body updates: Adds (5,5) then removes it since not eating apple.
3. **Move UP:** 
   - New position: (6,6)
   - Body updates: Adds (6,5), then removes it.
4. **Second Move UP:** 
   - New position: (6,7)
   - Body updates: Adds (6,6), then removes it.
5. **Third Move UP:** 
   - New position: (6,8) (reaches the apple)
   - Body updates: Adds (6,7). Since at apple's location, body segment remains.

**Answer:** The snake should move RIGHT once and then UP three times. The sequence of moves is:

RIGHT → UP → UP → UP

So, the final answer is \boxed{RIGHT, UP, UP, UP}.
