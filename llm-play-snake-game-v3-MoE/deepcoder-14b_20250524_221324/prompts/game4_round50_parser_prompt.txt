<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (0,7) to eat the apple at (6,8). Let's start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (0,7), and the body cells are [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. So the snake is long—five segments after the head. The direction it's moving in is "LEFT," which means the last move was to decrease the x-coordinate. Wait, no—the current direction is LEFT, so the next move will be further left. But wait, the head is at (0,7), and if the snake moves left from there, it would go out of bounds because x can't be less than 0. So that's a problem.

Wait, no—wait: The grid ranges from x=0 to 9, so moving left from x=0 would take it to (-1,7), which is invalid. Therefore, the snake cannot move LEFT again; that would cause it to die immediately. So the first move can't be LEFT because of the current direction and the position.

Wait, no—the movement rules say you can't reverse direction. The current direction is LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT. But wait, in this case, if the snake's head is at (0,7), moving LEFT would take it off the grid, which is a collision with the wall—so that's not allowed.

Wait no—the movement rules say that you can't reverse direction on the first move. Wait, no: rule 2 says you cannot reverse the current direction if it's not NONE. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT? But wait, no—the current direction is LEFT, so you can't choose RIGHT as the next move.

Wait no: rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is LEFT, you cannot choose RIGHT; same for others. So from LEFT, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or NONE (but in this case, it's not NONE). Wait, but the current direction is LEFT, so the allowed next moves are any except RIGHT.

Wait no: rule 2 says if current direction is "UP", you can't choose "DOWN" next. Similarly for others. So from LEFT, you cannot go RIGHT next. But in this case, the head is at (0,7). If the snake's current direction is LEFT, that means the last move was LEFT; but wait, no—the current direction determines where the next move will take it.

Wait, the current direction is LEFT, so if I choose any other direction except RIGHT, I can make the move. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT? Wait no: the current direction is LEFT, and you cannot reverse. Reversing would be going in the opposite direction—so for LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT. So next move can't be RIGHT.

But wait, if the snake's head is at (0,7) and the current direction is LEFT, moving LEFT again would take it to (-1,7), which is invalid. So that's a collision with the wall; thus, the snake dies. Therefore, the only possible moves are UP or DOWN.

Wait no: wait—the movement rules say that if you choose a direction that causes the head to go out of bounds, the snake dies. So from (0,7), choosing LEFT would immediately kill the snake. Similarly, if I choose RIGHT, it's allowed as long as x+1 <10? Wait no, current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait wait, let me clarify: rule 2 says you cannot reverse your direction. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT. But in this case, the snake's head is at (0,7). If I choose to move UP or DOWN, those are possible, but what about RIGHT?

Wait no—the current direction is LEFT, which means that the last movement was to the left. The next move can't be the opposite direction, which would be RIGHT. So from LEFT, you cannot choose RIGHT as the next move.

So from (0,7), with current direction LEFT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or NONE? Wait no—NONE is only if the snake hasn't moved yet. But in this case, the snake has a body, so it's moving.

Wait no: in the movement rules, directions allowed are "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". So from current direction LEFT, next move can be any except RIGHT. Wait no—rule 2 says you cannot reverse; i.e., if current is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT. But you can choose UP or DOWN.

Wait no: the rule says you can't reverse, meaning you can't go back to the opposite direction immediately. So from LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT, but it can be any other direction—like UP, DOWN, or even LEFT (if that's possible without collision).

But in this case, moving LEFT again would take the head to (-1,7), which is invalid, so it's a collision with the wall. So from (0,7), moving LEFT is not allowed; thus, the only possible moves are UP and DOWN.

Wait no—wait: the current direction is LEFT, but that means the snake was previously moving in that direction, not necessarily the next move. Wait no—the current direction determines where the head would go if you don't change direction. So if I choose to change direction now, it's allowed as long as it's not the opposite.

So from LEFT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but wait, can you stay in the same direction? The movement rules say that valid directions include "UP", etc., but does that mean you can keep moving in the same direction? Yes, I think so. So from current direction LEFT, next move can be any except RIGHT.

Wait no: rule 2 says you cannot reverse; it doesn't prohibit staying in the same direction. So you can continue moving in the same direction as long as it's allowed by grid boundaries and body positions.

So back to the problem: head is at (0,7), current direction is LEFT. Possible next moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is forbidden). But moving LEFT would take head to (-1,7), which is invalid. So only possible moves are UP or DOWN.

Let's consider both options:

Option 1: Move UP. New head position would be (0,8). Now, we need to check for collisions. The body cells are [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. So the new head at (0,8) is not in any of these body cells except possibly the tail.

Wait, the body list is given as from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So the current body cells are [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. The head is at (0,7). Wait no: wait, the head is at (0,7), and the first body cell is (1,7), which would be to the right of the head. That suggests that the snake's direction was to the RIGHT before the current direction became LEFT? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no—the current direction is LEFT, so the next move would be further left, but in this case, it can't because x=0. So maybe the body is arranged such that from the head at (0,7), the next segment is (1,7)—which is to the right—so perhaps the snake was moving RIGHT before, and now has changed direction to LEFT.

Wait no: the current direction is LEFT, which means that after this move, the new head will be to the left of where it is now. But if the head is at (0,7), moving LEFT would take it out of bounds unless I'm misunderstanding the grid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the grid's coordinate system. The problem says: "Coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right." So y increases as you go up. So moving UP increases y by 1, moving DOWN decreases it.

So if the head is at (0,7), which is the leftmost column in row 7 (assuming rows are numbered from bottom up). The body cells behind it are [(1,7), (2,7), ...], meaning that before the current direction of LEFT, the snake was moving to the right. So the body segments are trailing to the right and then turning.

Wait no—the head is at (0,7), and the next body cell is (1,7), which suggests that after the head, the body extends to the right—so the snake must have been moving RIGHT before changing direction to LEFT.

But wait, if the current direction is LEFT, that would mean the last move was LEFT, but with the head at (0,7) and next body segment at (1,7), which is to the right. That seems contradictory. Wait no: perhaps the snake's body is arranged in a way that after moving left, it turns.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that from (0,7), moving LEFT would take the head out of bounds, so that's invalid. So possible moves are UP or DOWN.

Let me check both options:

Option 1: Move UP to (0,8).

After moving, the new head is (0,8). Then, we need to update the body. Since we didn't eat an apple (apple is at (6,8)), the tail will move normally, so the last segment (3,9) would be removed.

Wait no: the body cells are [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. So after moving UP, the new head is (0,8). The previous head was at (0,7); now it moves to (0,8), so the next step would be that the body follows.

Wait no: perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body updates. When you move in a direction, each segment follows the one in front of it. So if the head is at (0,7) and we move UP to (0,8), then the new body segments would be:

New head: (0,8)
Previous head: (0,7) becomes next segment
Then (1,7), etc.

Wait no—actually, when you move in a direction, each body part follows the one in front. So if the head moves from (0,7) to (0,8) via UP, then the new body would be:

Head: (0,8)
Body 1: (0,7)
Body 2: (1,7)
Body 3: (2,7)
Body 4: (3,7)
Body 5: (3,8)
Body 6: (3,9)

Wait no—the body cells are the segments behind the head. So after moving, the new head is at (0,8), and the previous head position (0,7) becomes the first body segment.

So the new body would be:

Head: (0,8)
Body 1: (0,7)
Body 2: (1,7)
Body 3: (2,7)
Body 4: (3,7)
Body 5: (3,8)
Body 6: (3,9)

Wait but the original body cells are only five segments after the head. So perhaps I'm miscounting.

The current body cells are [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)], which is five segments. After moving UP to (0,8), the new body would be:

Head: (0,8)
Body 1: (0,7) [was head]
Body 2: (1,7)
Body 3: (2,7)
Body 4: (3,7)
Body 5: (3,8)
Body 6: (3,9)

Wait no—the body segments are the ones that were behind the head before the move. So when you move, each segment takes the place of the one in front. So after moving UP, the new head is at (0,8), and the first body segment becomes where the head was, which is (0,7). Then the next segments follow accordingly.

But regardless of that, the key point is whether moving UP would cause any collision with the body.

The new head is at (0,8). The current body cells are [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. So after the move, the first body cell would be (0,7), which was previously not part of the body except as the head.

Wait no: the original body cells are behind the head. The head is at (0,7); moving UP to (0,8) means that the new head is at (0,8). Then the previous head position becomes the first body segment, which is (0,7). So we need to check if this new head position (0,8) collides with any existing body segments except possibly the last one.

Looking at the original body cells: [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. The new head is at (0,8). None of these are at (0,8) except perhaps none. So moving UP to (0,8) doesn't collide with any body segments.

Wait, but the next segment after the head would be (0,7), which was the previous head position and isn't in the original body cells—those start at (1,7). So no collision there.

So moving UP is possible. Then, we can proceed from there.

Similarly, if I move DOWN to (0,6), let's see:

New head: (0,6).

Original body cells are [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. So the new head is at (0,6). The first body segment would be (0,7)—wait no, when you move DOWN from (0,7) to (0,6), the previous head was at (0,7), so that becomes the first body segment. Then the next segments follow.

So we need to check if any of the new head's position (0,6) is in the original body cells: no, because the original body starts at y=7 and higher.

But wait, when you move DOWN, y decreases by 1. So from (0,7), moving DOWN takes it to (0,6). The first body segment would be (0,7), then (1,7), etc. But in this case, the new head is at (0,6), which isn't part of the original body cells, so no collision.

So both UP and DOWN are possible as next moves, given that the current direction is LEFT and we can't choose RIGHT.

Now, considering the long-term goal: we need to navigate towards the apple at (6,8). So perhaps moving in a way that allows us to reach there without hitting our own body or going out of bounds.

If I move UP first:

Head: (0,8)

Then, next moves could be to the right (towards x=6), but considering the current body arrangement, which after the first UP would have segments at (0,7), (1,7), etc., we might need to avoid getting stuck.

Alternatively, moving DOWN first:

Head: (0,6)

Then perhaps move towards the right and up.

But let's plan a possible path.

Option A: Move UP first.

Move 1: UP from (0,7) to (0,8). Now head is at (0,8).

Now, next moves can be RIGHT, as long as we don't reverse direction. Wait no—the current direction after moving UP would now be UP, so next move can't be DOWN.

Wait no: the movement rules state that you cannot reverse your current direction on the first move if it's NONE; otherwise, you just can't reverse. So if I moved from LEFT to UP (since LEFT was the previous direction), then the new direction is UP, and the next move can't be DOWN.

So after moving UP, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but not DOWN).

Wait no: rule 2 says "Cannot reverse". If the current direction is UP, you cannot choose DOWN next. So if I moved to UP, then next moves can't be DOWN.

But in any case, let's think about a path:

From (0,8), move RIGHT towards x=6.

So after move 1: (0,8)

Move 2: RIGHT to (1,8). Is this possible? Let's check for collisions.

After moving UP to (0,8), the body segments would be:

Head: (0,8)
Body 1: (0,7) [previous head]
Body 2: (1,7)
Body 3: (2,7)
Body 4: (3,7)
Body 5: (3,8)
Body 6: (3,9)

So when moving RIGHT to (1,8), the new head is at (1,8). We need to check if this position is in any of the body segments except possibly the last one (which would be removed if not eating).

The current body after move 1:

Body 1: (0,7)
Body 2: (1,7)
Body 3: (2,7)
Body 4: (3,7)
Body 5: (3,8)
Body 6: (3,9)

So the new head is at (1,8). Is this position in any of the body cells? Yes—body segment 5 is at (3,8), which is different. So no collision.

Wait, no—the new head is at (1,8). The body segments are:

(0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9).

So (1,8) isn't any of these except perhaps none. So it's safe to move.

After moving RIGHT to (1,8), the body updates:

Head: (1,8)
Body 1: (0,8) [previous head]
Body 2: (0,7)
Body 3: (1,7)
Body 4: (2,7)
Body 5: (3,7)
Body 6: (3,8)
Body 7: (3,9)

Wait no—the body segments follow the path. Each segment moves into the position of the previous one.

So after moving RIGHT from (0,8) to (1,8), the new head is at (1,8). The previous head (0,8) becomes the first body segment. Then the next segments shift accordingly.

But regardless, we need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any existing body segments except possibly the last one if it's not eating.

So in this case, moving to (1,8) is safe.

Then move 3: RIGHT again to (2,8). Check for collision:

Head now at (2,8). Body segments after move 2:

Body 1: (1,8)
Body 2: (0,8)
Body 3: (0,7)
Body 4: (1,7)
Body 5: (2,7)
Body 6: (3,7)
Body 7: (3,8)
Body 8: (3,9)

Wait no—the body segments would be:

After move 2 (RIGHT to (1,8)):

Body after move 2:
Head: (1,8)
Body 1: (0,8)
Body 2: (0,7)
Body 3: (1,7)
Body 4: (2,7)
Body 5: (3,7)
Body 6: (3,8)
Body 7: (3,9)

So moving to (2,8) would require checking if any body segments are there. The current body doesn't have (2,8), so it's safe.

Continue this way until reaching x=6.

But perhaps a better strategy is needed to avoid getting stuck or hitting the body.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first would be better.

Move 1: DOWN from (0,7) to (0,6).

Now head at (0,6). Body segments:

Head: (0,6)
Body 1: (0,7)
Body 2: (1,7)
Body 3: (2,7)
Body 4: (3,7)
Body 5: (3,8)
Body 6: (3,9)

No collision since none of the body segments are at (0,6).

Move 2: RIGHT to (1,6). Check if safe.

Current body after move 1:

Head: (0,6)
Body 1: (0,7)
Body 2: (1,7)
Body 3: (2,7)
Body 4: (3,7)
Body 5: (3,8)
Body 6: (3,9)

So moving to (1,6) is safe.

Move 3: RIGHT to (2,6). Safe as well.

Continue this way until reaching x=6 at y=6 or lower. Then move up towards y=8.

But considering that the apple is at (6,8), maybe going down first and then right and up might be longer but safer.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a spiral or another pattern.

However, regardless of the path, the key is to avoid collisions with the body and reach the target.

Another consideration: as the snake grows, it becomes harder to maneuver without hitting itself. So planning a path that allows for growth without getting stuck is important.

Perhaps the optimal path is:

Move UP first, then RIGHT multiple times while ensuring that each move doesn't collide with the body.

But let's try to outline a possible sequence.

Starting at (0,7):

1. Move UP to (0,8). No collision.
2. Move RIGHT to (1,8). Safe.
3. Move RIGHT to (2,8). Safe.
4. Continue moving RIGHT until x=6: moves 4-9 would be moving right each time.

Wait no—each move only changes one coordinate by one unit, so from x=0 to x=6 is six moves to the right.

So:

Move 1: UP (0,8)
Move 2: RIGHT (1,8)
Move 3: RIGHT (2,8)
Move 4: RIGHT (3,8)
Move 5: RIGHT (4,8)
Move 6: RIGHT (5,8)
Move 7: RIGHT (6,8) - reached the apple!

But wait—after each move, the snake grows unless it eats something. Wait no—the snake only grows when it eats food, which is presumably at (6,8). So after moving to (6,8), if that's where the apple is, then the snake would grow by one segment.

Wait but in this case, the path above doesn't involve eating yet—it just moves towards (6,8). But perhaps I'm misunderstanding whether the apple is stationary or not. Assuming the apple is at (6,8) and remains there until eaten.

So if we move to (6,8), that's where the apple is, so the snake would eat it and grow longer. Then we need to continue moving in a way that avoids self-collision.

But wait—the initial problem doesn't specify whether the snake needs to collect multiple apples or just one. Assuming it's just one, then reaching (6,8) would be sufficient.

However, I think the question is more about finding a path from the starting position to the target without colliding with the body, given that the snake can move in four directions and each move changes one coordinate by one unit.

So the minimal steps would be:

From (0,7):

1. Move UP to (0,8)
2. Move RIGHT six times to reach (6,8)

That's 1 + 6 = 7 moves.

But wait—it can't just move from (0,8) directly; it has to navigate through each step, ensuring that after each move, the head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the last one if growing.

Wait no—if the snake is moving towards the apple and eats it, then the snake grows. But in this case, we're just trying to reach (6,8), not necessarily eat anything—assuming that's where the food is, but perhaps the problem is more about pathfinding regardless of eating.

But I think the main point is to find a path from the starting position (0,7) to (6,8) without colliding with any part of the snake's body at each step. Since the snake can move in four directions, and each segment follows the previous one, we have to make sure that when the head moves into a new position, it doesn't land on any of the current body segments except possibly the last one if growing.

Wait no—the snake's body is fixed; only the head moves. Each body part follows the path of the previous one. So as long as the new head position isn't where any existing body segment (except perhaps the tail, which would be removed if not growing) is present, it's safe.

But in this problem, since we're just moving towards a target and not necessarily concerned with growth or food, I think the main constraint is avoiding self-collision at each step.

So the minimal path from (0,7) to (6,8) would be:

Move UP once to (0,8), then RIGHT six times to reach (6,8). That's a total of seven moves.

But let me visualize this:

Start: (0,7)
1. UP → (0,8)
2. RIGHT → (1,8)
3. RIGHT → (2,8)
4. RIGHT → (3,8)
5. RIGHT → (4,8)
6. RIGHT → (5,8)
7. RIGHT → (6,8)

Yes, that's seven moves.

Alternatively, moving DOWN first and then RIGHT and UP could also work, but it would take more steps.

So the minimal number of moves is seven.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at (0,7) on a grid to a target position at (6,8) without colliding with any part of its own body. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right, changing one coordinate by one unit per move.

### Approach
The key steps to solve this problem are:
1. **Understand Movement Constraints**: The snake can only move one unit at a time in any of the four cardinal directions. Each segment of the snake follows the segment in front of it.
2. **Avoid Self-Collision**: Ensure that each new head position does not land on any existing body segments, which could cause a collision and end the game.
3. **Plan the Path**: The shortest path from (0,7) to (6,8) involves moving up once to reach row 8 and then moving right six times to reach column 6.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the steps to navigate the snake from (0,7) to (6,8)

# Initial position of the head
head = (0, 7)
body = [(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)]  # Example body segments

# Move up once
head = (0, 8)

# Then move right six times
for _ in range(6):
    head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (0,7) with its body extending behind it.
2. **First Move - Up**: Moving up from (0,7) to (0,8) ensures the head is in a new row without colliding with any body segments since they are all in row 7 or lower.
3. **Subsequent Moves - Right**: After moving up, each subsequent move to the right increases the column index by one until reaching column 6. This path avoids collisions as none of these positions interfere with the snake's body segments.

By following this approach, we ensure the snake reaches the target position efficiently while avoiding self-collision.
