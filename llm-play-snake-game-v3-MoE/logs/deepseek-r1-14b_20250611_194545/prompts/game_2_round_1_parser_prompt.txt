========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how the snake can move from (5,5) to eat the apple at (3,4). Let's start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (5,5), and there are no body cells given, so the snake must be of length 1. The current direction is "NONE", which means any first move is allowed except reversing, but since it's NONE, all directions are possible initially.

The apple is at (3,4). So from (5,5) to (3,4), we need a net movement of left twice and down once. Because the Manhattan distance is 2 in x (left) and 1 in y (down).

Let me think about possible paths. The snake can go straight left twice, but I have to check if any body segments would block that. Since the body is empty now, it's safe.

First move: LEFT to (4,5). That's a valid move. Next move: LEFT again to (3,5). Then down once to (3,4) to eat the apple.

Wait, but after moving twice left and then down, will the snake collide with itself? Since the body is empty initially, each movement adds a segment except when eating an apple. So let's walk through each step.

First move: LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5). Body becomes [(5,5)] because we add the old head, but since it's moving normally, the tail is removed if not growing. Wait, no—since we're not eating an apple yet, after the first move, the body will be empty again because when you move, the tail is removed unless you ate the apple.

Wait, no: Let me clarify the movement rules.

When you move:

- Compute new head.
- Check for collision.
- Update body:
   a. Insert old head into the body list.
   b. If new_head == apple, grow (don't remove tail).
   c. Else, remove last element of body.

So in the first move, moving LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5):

Body was empty before. So after inserting old head (5,5), the body becomes [(5,5)]. Then since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail—but since the body is now length 1, removing the tail leaves it empty again.

So after first move, snake's head is at (4,5), body is empty.

Second move: LEFT to (3,5). Insert old head (4,5) into body. Now body is [(4,5)]. Since no apple eaten, remove tail (which was nothing because it's the new head, so maybe I'm misunderstanding this part.

Wait, perhaps after each normal move (not eating apple), we add the old head and then remove the last element of the body. So initially, after first move, body is empty. Then for second move:

New head is (3,5). Insert old head (4,5) into body, making it [ (4,5) ]. Since no apple eaten, we remove the last element—but there's only one, so body becomes empty again.

So third move: DOWN from (3,5) to (3,4). Now, check if this new head collides with any body segments. After moving, insert old head (3,5), making body [ (3,5) ]. Since we ate the apple (new_head is at apple position), we don't remove the tail.

So now, the snake's body after eating becomes [ (3,5), ... ] plus the new head. Wait, no—the process is:

When you eat the apple, you insert old head into body, then do not remove the tail because of step 3b: grow.

Wait, in this case, initial state before movement is:

Head at (3,5), body empty, apple at (3,4). So when moving DOWN to (3,4):

- new_head is (3,4).
- Check collision: it's inside bounds and not in the body (which is empty except for what's about to happen).

Then update body:

a. Insert old head (3,5) into front of body → body becomes [ (3,5) ].
b. Since new_head == apple, grow: do not remove tail.

So now, the body is [ (3,5), ... ] but since we didn't remove the tail, the length increases by 1. So the snake's body after this move will have two segments: head at (3,4), then (3,5).

This seems safe because there are no collisions.

So the moves would be LEFT, LEFT, DOWN.

Let me verify the movement steps:

Move 1: LEFT → (4,5). Body is empty after moving.
Move 2: LEFT → (3,5). Insert old head (4,5), body becomes [ (4,5) ]. Then remove tail, which was nothing, so body remains empty.
Wait no—when you move normally, you add the old head to the front and then remove the last element. So after first move, body is empty. After second move:

Insert (4,5) into front → [ (4,5) ]. Then since not eating apple, remove tail—so body becomes empty again.

Move 3: DOWN to (3,4). Insert old head (3,5) into body → [ (3,5) ]. Since new_head is apple, do not remove tail. So body becomes [ (3,5) ] and the snake's length increases by one.

So after eating, the snake has two segments: head at (3,4), body at (3,5).

This seems correct. Also, after eating, there must be at least one legal move next turn. Let's check:

After eating, the head is at (3,4). The possible directions are any except the opposite of current direction. Current direction was "DOWN" for the last move. So can't go UP next.

So from (3,4), options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Looking around, body is [(3,5)], so if I choose to move in a safe direction:

For example, moving LEFT would take me to (2,4). Check collision: not with any body except the tail. The tail is at (3,5), which will move next step unless I eat again.

Wait, after eating, the body is [ (3,5) ] because when we ate, the old head was inserted, and no removal occurred. So in this case, from (3,4), moving LEFT would take to (2,4). Check if that's safe: it's within bounds and not colliding with any body except possibly the tail.

But according to rule 3b, when eating apple, you don't remove the tail, so the tail remains at (3,5). So from (3,4), moving LEFT would be to (2,4), which is safe because it's not in the body segments—only (3,5) is there.

So after eating, I can make a move like LEFT without collision.

Therefore, the initial moves of LEFT, LEFT, DOWN are valid and allow the snake to eat the apple.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves left twice to reach column 3, then down once to reach the apple at (3,4), ensuring no collisions with walls or body segments."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (3, 4). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
