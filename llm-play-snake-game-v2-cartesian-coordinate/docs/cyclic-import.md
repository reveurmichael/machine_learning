## Question

Do we really have cyclic import in this project?

## Answer

Short answer: in normal gameplay (i.e., when you launch the program through `main.py` or through any module that imports `snake_game`), there is **no real run-time cyclic import problem**. Pylint reports one because it performs a static scan and sees that

• `snake_game.py` → imports `gui.py`  
• `gui.py` → has a `from snake_game import SnakeGame` inside the  `if __name__ == "__main__":` block  

Even though that second import is wrapped in the “run-as-script” guard, Pylint still counts it when it builds its module-dependency graph, so it warns about a cycle `gui  ↔  snake_game`.

What actually happens at run time:

1. Normal execution path (running `main.py` or any code that does `from snake_game import SnakeGame`):
   • Python loads `snake_game.py` → which loads `gui.py`  
   • `gui.py` finishes importing **without** ever importing `snake_game`, because the guarded block is skipped.  
   • No cycle exists; everything works.

2. Less-common path (you execute `python gui.py` directly):
   • Python starts loading `gui.py` first.  
   • When it reaches the bottom of the file it is still executing `gui.py`, then hits the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block and does `from snake_game import SnakeGame`.  
   • `snake_game.py` immediately imports `gui.py`, finds that it is already in `sys.modules` (partially initialised), and continues. That *is* a genuine cyclic import, but Python tolerates it because the first branch of the cycle (`gui`) is already half-built. The result is that every attribute defined **after** the import statement in `gui.py` is not yet available to `snake_game` during its import, but in our case nothing from that part of `gui.py` is needed by `snake_game`, so it still runs fine.  

Because of that corner case, Pylint is technically correct: a cycle can exist. For day-to-day usage the cycle causes no harm, but if you want to silence the warning without using `# pylint: disable=cyclic-import` you would need to break the potential cycle entirely, e.g.

• move the human-control demo code at the bottom of `gui.py` into a separate file (`human_control.py`) so `gui.py` never imports `snake_game`, or  
• move the `from snake_game import SnakeGame` inside a small helper function so the import is executed long after module initialisation.

So:

• Running through `main.py`: no cycle at run-time.  
• Running `python gui.py`: a benign but real cycle occurs; Pylint flags it.  
• If the project never runs `gui.py` directly, you can safely leave the current `pylint: disable=cyclic-import` directive.
