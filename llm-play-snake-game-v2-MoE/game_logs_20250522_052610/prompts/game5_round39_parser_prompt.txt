Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake problem where the head is at (0,8), and the apple is at (1,1). The snake's body is in certain positions, and I need to figure out a safe path for the head to reach the apple without colliding with the body or going out of bounds. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the current state:

- **Head Position:** (0,8)
- **Current Direction:** LEFT
- **Body Cells:** [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]
- **Apple Position:** (1,1)

The snake is moving to the left because the current direction is LEFT. The body cells are behind the head in a way that suggests the snake is extending towards (1,8). 

I need to figure out how to move the head from (0,8) to (1,1) while following all the movement rules and constraints.

Let's start by visualizing the grid. The grid is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at the top-right. So, moving UP increases the y-coordinate, which takes us towards the top, and DOWN decreases it, taking us towards the bottom.

The apple is at (1,1), which is to the right and below the head's current position. The head is at (0,8), so in terms of x, it needs to move right by 1 unit (from 0 to 1) and down by 7 units (from 8 to 1).

The movement rules say that we can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT. But wait, in this case, the head is at (0,8), so moving LEFT would take it out of bounds because x=0 can't go lower than 0. So the only valid moves from here are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. However, since the current direction is LEFT, we cannot move RIGHT on the first move either because that's considered a reverse? Wait, no. The rule says you can't reverse direction, so if current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT. So from LEFT, possible moves are UP and DOWN.

Wait, but the current direction is LEFT, which means the snake was moving left in the previous step. Now, since it's at (0,8), which is x=0, moving further LEFT would take it to x=-1, which is invalid. So the next move can't be LEFT because it would cause death. Also, can't reverse direction by going RIGHT. So from LEFT, possible moves are UP and DOWN.

Wait, no: according to rule 3, you cannot reverse direction. If current direction is LEFT, then you can't go RIGHT next. But in this case, the head is at (0,8), so moving LEFT would be invalid because x=0-1=-1. So possible moves are UP and DOWN.

So first move options: UP or DOWN.

But let's think about where the body is. The body cells are [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]. Wait, those positions seem a bit scattered. Let me plot them:

- (3,6) is somewhere to the right and down from the head.
- (3,7): same x as above, y=7.
- (3,8): same x, y=8, which is where the head is currently? Wait no, the body cells exclude the head. So the body is at those positions.

Wait, that can't be right because the head is at (0,8), so how are there body parts at higher x values like 3 and 2?

Oh, I think I see. The snake's body is trailing behind in a certain way. Let me try to reconstruct the path:

If the current direction is LEFT, then the snake was moving left until it couldn't anymore because it hit (0,8). But wait, that doesn't make sense because you can't move beyond x=0.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the body cells. The body cells are [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]. So from this list, it seems like the snake was moving left through (1,8) to reach (0,8). But that would mean the body is at positions with higher x than the head. That suggests that the head is at (0,8), and the body is trailing behind in a way that's impossible because you can't have body parts with higher x than the head if the current direction is LEFT.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body cells are ordered. The body cells list represents the segments after the head. So each step, the snake moves forward, and the body follows. For example, when moving left, the next position would be (0-1,8), but since that's invalid, the snake can't move further left unless it has space.

Wait, no: in this case, the head is at (0,8). If the current direction is LEFT, then the previous step must have been a move to the left. But moving left from (1,8) would take us to (0,8), which is where the head is now. So perhaps the body cells are [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)], meaning that before this step, the head was at (1,8). Then it moved left to (0,8), becoming the new head, and the previous segments shifted accordingly.

But wait, in snake movement, when you move forward, each body part follows the one in front of it. So if the head is at (0,8) moving LEFT, then the next body part would be at (1,8). But according to the given body cells, that's exactly what we have: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)].

So after moving left from (1,8) to (0,8), the body becomes [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]. So the head is at (0,8), and the next part is (1,8).

Now, considering that, if we try to move UP or DOWN from (0,8):

- Moving UP: (0,9) which is invalid because y=9 is beyond 0-9.
- Moving DOWN: (0,7). But let's check if that's possible.

Wait, no: the grid is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9), so moving up from (0,8) would be y=9, which is allowed. Wait, wait, because in the coordinate system, (0,0) is bottom-left and (9,9) is top-right. So moving UP increases y by 1. So from (0,8), moving UP takes us to (0,9), which is within bounds.

Wait, but according to movement rules, you can't move beyond the grid. So each move must result in x between 0 and 9 inclusive and y between 0 and 9 inclusive. So (0,9) is valid because it's within 0<=x<10 and 0<=y<10? Wait no: wait, coordinates are from 0 to 9 for both x and y, so (0,9) is the top-left corner, which is allowed.

So moving UP would take us to (0,9), but let's see if that's safe. The body cells are [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]. So in (0,9), we need to check if this position is occupied by any part of the body except the head.

Looking at the body cells: none are at (0,9). So moving UP is safe. Similarly, moving DOWN would take us to (0,7). Let's see if that's safe. The body cell at (3,8) is at x=3, y=8. Others are at x=3,6-8 and x=2,8; x=1,8. So (0,7) isn't in the body cells either.

So both UP and DOWN are possible as first moves.

But let's think about the movement constraints:

1. Can't reverse direction: current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT.
2. From LEFT, possible directions are UP and DOWN.

Now, moving to (0,9) via UP would take us further up, but how does that help in getting to (1,1)? It seems like a detour. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (0,7) might bring us closer or at least not move away from the target.

But let's think about the Manhattan distance. The target is (1,1). From (0,8), the Manhattan distance is |0-1| + |8-1| = 1+7=8. We need to reduce this as much as possible.

If we first move DOWN from (0,8) to (0,7), that reduces y by 1, making the distance |0-1| + |7-1|=1+6=7. That's better than moving UP which would increase the distance.

Alternatively, if we can find a path that allows us to move towards the target without getting stuck or colliding with the body, that would be ideal.

But wait, after moving DOWN to (0,7), what next? Let's think about possible moves from there.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to first try to figure out a path and then check for collisions.

Alternatively, maybe we should move RIGHT as soon as possible because the apple is at x=1, which is to the right of the current head position (x=0). But wait, can we move RIGHT? Since the current direction is LEFT, moving RIGHT would be reversing direction. According to rule 3, you cannot reverse direction unless the current direction is NONE.

So from LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. So first move must be UP or DOWN.

Therefore, from (0,8), possible first moves are UP and DOWN.

Let's consider both options:

Option A: Move UP to (0,9). Then what? From there, the new direction would be UP, so next move can't be DOWN.

But moving up further might not help because we need to get down towards y=1.

Alternatively, from (0,9), perhaps we can change direction and start moving right. But let's see.

Wait, but after moving UP, the body shifts. So the new head is at (0,9), and the body becomes [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8)]. Wait no: when you move, the head moves first, then each body part follows.

Wait, let me clarify:

When the snake is at (0,8) moving LEFT, and we decide to move UP instead. So new head position would be (0,9). The previous body parts shift: the old head (0,8) becomes the next body segment, so the body cells become [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8)]. Wait no: the body cells list given is before the move. So after moving to (0,9), the new body would be [all previous body cells plus the old head position], and the tail might not move if we ate an apple.

But in this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so the tail would shrink unless we just ate it.

Wait, but in our initial state, the snake hasn't eaten the apple yet because the apple is at (1,1). So after moving to (0,9), the body cells would be [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8)], but since we didn't eat the apple, the tail would remove the last cell. Wait no: when you move, the head moves, and each body part follows. So the new body cells after moving UP would be [the old body cells shifted], plus the new head.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The snake's body is a list of segments excluding the head. When the head moves, each segment takes the place of the previous one. So if we move from (0,8) to (0,9), the new body cells would be [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)], and then (0,8) becomes part of the body as well? Or does it add the new head position without removing the tail?

Wait no: when you move, the head moves to a new position. The previous head becomes the next segment in the body, and all other segments shift accordingly. The tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

In this case, since we haven't eaten the apple yet, after moving, the tail (3,6) would be removed because it's the oldest part of the body.

So after moving UP to (0,9), the new head is at (0,9), and the body becomes [(3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8)]. Wait no: perhaps the initial body cells are [3,6; 3,7; 3,8; 2,8; 1,8], so when moving to (0,9), the new body would be [3,7; 3,8; 2,8; 1,8; 0,8], and then check for collisions with the head.

Wait, but (0,9) is the new head. The body now includes (3,7), (3,8), etc., so none of them are at (0,9). So that's safe.

But then from (0,9), what direction can we move? Since our previous move was UP (from LEFT to UP), the next move cannot be DOWN because that would reverse direction. Wait no: the current direction after moving UP is now UP. So next moves cannot be DOWN.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. The movement changes the direction of the snake. If you were going LEFT and then decide to go UP, your new direction is UP. Therefore, the next move can't be DOWN because that would reverse direction (from UP to DOWN).

But perhaps it's better to avoid moving in such a way that we can't get to the target.

Alternatively, let's consider Option B: Move DOWN from (0,8) to (0,7). The new head is at (0,7), and the body cells become [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)], but with the old head at (0,8) added? Or do they shift?

Wait no: when moving from (0,8) to (0,7), the new head is (0,7), and each body segment follows. So:

- The previous head was (0,8).
- The next move to (0,7) would cause the previous head (0,8) to become part of the body.
- The old body cells were [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)].

So after moving, the new body cells would be [ (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8) ] but since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (3,6) is removed. So the new body becomes [(3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8)].

So after moving DOWN to (0,7), our head is at (0,7), and we need to plan the next moves towards (1,1). But now, let's see if that path would cause any collisions.

Wait, but in this new position, we're at (0,7), and direction is DOWN. So the next move can't be UP because that would reverse direction (from DOWN to UP).

But perhaps moving RIGHT from here is possible? Wait, no: current direction after moving DOWN is now DOWN. So the next move can't be UP; it could be LEFT or RIGHT?

Wait no: after moving DOWN, your direction becomes DOWN, so you cannot move UP in the next step because that would reverse direction.

So from (0,7), possible moves are LEFT and RIGHT? Or can we change direction to other directions except the opposite?

Wait, I think movement is such that once you start moving in a certain direction, you can't immediately turn around. So if you were moving LEFT, then you can move UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT immediately. Similarly, after moving UP, you can't move DOWN.

But perhaps movement allows any direction as long as it's not the opposite of the current direction.

Wait no: I think in this case, when you change direction from LEFT to UP, your new direction is UP, and next moves cannot be DOWN because that would reverse direction. So from (0,9), moving in any direction except DOWN is allowed.

Similarly, from (0,7) after moving DOWN, the next move can't be UP.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Maybe a better approach is to think about possible paths.

Let me consider Option B: first move DOWN to (0,7).

From there, what's next? Let's see:

We need to get to (1,1). So ideally, we want to start moving towards the right and then down.

But from (0,7), if our current direction is DOWN, perhaps it's better to change direction to RIGHT as soon as possible.

Wait, but after moving DOWN from (0,8) to (0,7), our new direction is DOWN. So next moves can't be UP. But we could turn either LEFT or RIGHT.

But wait, no: movement in grids usually allows turning left or right relative to your current direction, except the opposite direction. So if you're moving DOWN, you can move LEFT or RIGHT but not UP.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let's clarify:

- Current direction after first move is DOWN (from (0,8) to (0,7)).
- Next moves cannot be in the opposite direction, which is UP.
- So from (0,7), possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue moving DOWN.

So let's consider moving RIGHT from (0,7). That would take us to (1,7).

Is that position safe? The body cells after moving are [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8)] but since we moved DOWN first and then RIGHT, the body might have shifted again.

Wait, no: each move updates the head and shifts the body. So after moving DOWN to (0,7), the next move is RIGHT to (1,7). The new head is at (1,7). Now, check if any part of the body is at (1,7).

The body cells before this second move are [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8)]. So when moving RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), does any of the body parts include (1,7)?

Looking at the list: (3,6), (3,7), etc. No part is at (1,7). So it's safe.

Now, new head is at (1,7), and direction has changed to RIGHT because we moved from DOWN to RIGHT? Or does moving RIGHT keep the same direction as before?

Wait no: each move changes the direction. If you were moving DOWN and then move RIGHT, your new direction is now RIGHT, meaning next moves can't be LEFT.

But I think movement in grid-based games allows for turning left or right relative to your current direction. So from DOWN, turning RIGHT would face towards the right side of where you're facing, but perhaps it's better to model it as simply changing direction without worrying about relative directions, except that you can't immediately reverse direction.

Alternatively, maybe each move just changes your current direction to the new direction, regardless of previous direction, as long as it's not the exact opposite.

Wait, no: in this problem, movement allows any direction except the immediate reversal. So if you're moving LEFT and decide to go UP or DOWN, that's allowed, but RIGHT is forbidden because it would be reversing direction.

Similarly, if you move UP, you can't immediately move DOWN again.

So after moving DOWN from (0,8) to (0,7), your current direction is DOWN. So next moves can't be UP; they can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If we choose to move RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), our new direction becomes RIGHT. Now, the body cells after this move would be:

- Previous head: (0,7)
- Previous body: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]
Wait no: each time you move, the head moves and the body follows. So the initial body cells after moving DOWN were [previous body shifted]. Let me try to track this more accurately.

After first move:

- Head: (0,7)
- Body: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)] with the old head at (0,8) added? Or is it that after moving, the body becomes [old body without the tail]?

Wait, no. Let's model this correctly:

The initial state before any move:

- Head: (0,8)
- Body: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]

When we move DOWN to (0,7):

- New head: (0,7)
- The previous head (0,8) becomes part of the body.
- So the new body is [ (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8) ] but since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (3,6) is removed.

So after moving DOWN:

- Head: (0,7)
- Body: [ (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8) ]

Now, when moving RIGHT to (1,7):

- New head: (1,7)
- Previous head (0,7) becomes part of the body.
- So new body is [ (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7) ]
- Tail (3,7) is removed because we didn't eat an apple.

So new body after moving RIGHT:

- Body: [ (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7) ]

Now, check if any part of the body is at (1,7). The body cells are at x=3, y=8; x=2,8; x=1,8; x=0,8; and x=0,7. So (1,7) isn't in the body, so it's safe.

Now, new direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction.

From (1,7), our target is at (1,1). So we need to go down. Let's see:

We can move DOWN from (1,7) to (1,6). But let's check if that's allowed.

Current direction is RIGHT; moving DOWN isn't the opposite, so it's allowed.

So new head: (1,6).

Body after this move:

- Previous body was [ (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7) ]
- Add previous head at (1,7) to body.
- Remove tail (3,8).

So new body: [ (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]

Check if (1,6) is safe. The body cells are x=2,8; etc., so no conflict.

Now, at (1,6), direction is DOWN.

We can continue moving DOWN:

- To (1,5): safe.
- Then to (1,4).
- Etc., until reaching y=1.

But wait, we need to make sure that each move doesn't cause the head to collide with its own body. Let's simulate a few more steps.

After moving to (1,6), then to (1,5):

Body after moving DOWN again:

- Previous body: [ (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]
- New head: (1,5)
- Add previous head at (1,6) to body.
- Remove tail (2,8).

Body becomes: [ (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6) ]

Still no collision.

Continuing down:

(1,4): safe.

And so on until reaching y=1.

Wait, but moving from (1,7) down to (1,1) would require 7 steps downward. But let's see if that's feasible without crossing the body.

But wait a second: after moving DOWN several times, we'll reach (1,1). Let's check if any of those positions are already in the body.

Looking back:

After initial moves, the body is at x=3,8; 2,8; 1,8; etc., which are all higher y-values. So as we move down from y=7 to y=1, none of these new positions will overlap with existing body parts.

Wait no: actually, after moving DOWN multiple times, the head moves towards (1,1), but the body is following behind. So until we reach a point where the body catches up, there's no collision.

But let me think again: when you move right from (0,7) to (1,7), then down to (1,6), etc., the body is at:

- After moving to (1,7): body includes (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7)
Wait no, earlier I thought that after moving RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), the body becomes [ (3,7), but wait, perhaps my previous tracking was incorrect.

Let me try a different approach. Let's model each move step by step with accurate head and body positions.

Initial state:

- Head: (0,8)
- Body: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]

Step 1: Move DOWN to (0,7)

- New head: (0,7)
- Body becomes [ (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8) ] but since no apple is eaten, tail is removed.

So body after step 1:

- [(3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8)]

Step 2: Move RIGHT to (1,7)

- New head: (1,7)
- Body becomes [ (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7) ] but tail (3,7) is removed.

So body after step 2:

- [(3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7)]

Step 3: Move DOWN to (1,6)

- New head: (1,6)
- Body becomes [ (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ] but tail (3,8) is removed.

Body after step 3:

- [(2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7)]

Step 4: Move DOWN to (1,5)

- New head: (1,5)
- Body becomes [ (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6) ] but tail (2,8) is removed.

Body after step 4:

- [(1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6)]

Step 5: Move DOWN to (1,4)

- New head: (1,4)
- Body becomes [ (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ] but tail (1,8) is removed.

Body after step 5:

- [(0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]

Step 6: Move DOWN to (1,3)

- New head: (1,3)
- Body becomes [ (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] but tail (0,8) is removed.

Body after step 6:

- [(0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]

Step 7: Move DOWN to (1,2)

- New head: (1,2)
- Body becomes [ (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] but tail (0,7) is removed.

Body after step 7:

- [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Step 8: Move DOWN to (1,1)

- New head: (1,1)
- Body becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] but tail (1,7) is removed.

Body after step 8:

- [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]

Now, the head is at (1,1). The target was to reach (1,1), so it's achieved. But we need to ensure that during these moves, the head didn't collide with any part of its body.

Looking back:

- After step 8: head is at (1,1), body parts are from (1,6) down to (1,2). So no overlap between head and body at any point.

Therefore, this path works. However, we need to make sure that each move doesn't cause an immediate collision after the move.

Wait a second: in step 8, moving DOWN to (1,1), is that allowed? Let's check:

Before step 8:

- Head was at (1,2)
- Body was [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

So when moving from (1,2) to (1,1), the new head is at (1,1). The body after this move would be:

- Previous body without tail: remove (1,7)
- Add previous head at (1,2)

Wait no: each time you move, the head moves and all body segments follow. So when moving from (1,2) to (1,1), the new head is at (1,1). The previous head was at (1,2), which becomes part of the body.

So after step 8:

- Body would be [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]

And the new head is at (1,1). Now, check if any body part is at (1,1): No, because the body starts from y=6 down to y=2.

Thus, no collision occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in tracking. Let me confirm:

After step 7, we were at (1,2) with body [(1,7), (1,6), etc.] Then moving DOWN adds (1,1) as head and the previous body shifts.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that each move appends the new head position and removes the tail, then checks for collision between the new head and any part of the updated body.

But in this case, since we're moving straight down from y=7 to y=1 along x=1, and our body follows behind, there's no collision.

Therefore, Option B seems feasible.

Alternatively, let's see if Option A would work: first move UP instead of DOWN.

Wait, but the head is at (0,8). Moving UP would take it to (-1,8), which might not be allowed depending on grid boundaries. Assuming the grid starts at y=0 or higher, moving up from (0,8) to (-1,8) could be out of bounds. So perhaps Option A isn't viable.

Therefore, the correct path is:

Move DOWN from (0,8) to (0,7), then RIGHT to (1,7), then DOWN to (1,6), and continue moving DOWN until reaching (1,1).

So the sequence of moves would be: DOWN, RIGHT, then six times DOWN.

But let me count the exact steps:

From initial position (0,8):

1. Move DOWN to (0,7)
2. Move RIGHT to (1,7)
3. Move DOWN to (1,6)
4. Move DOWN to (1,5)
5. Move DOWN to (1,4)
6. Move DOWN to (1,3)
7. Move DOWN to (1,2)
8. Move DOWN to (1,1)

So that's a total of 8 moves: 1 DOWN, 1 RIGHT, and 6 DOWNs.

Alternatively, perhaps we can do it in fewer steps by moving more efficiently, but as per the problem statement, we just need a valid path, not necessarily the shortest.

Therefore, one possible sequence is:

DOWN → RIGHT → DOWN ×6

Which would reach (1,1) without colliding with the body.

To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting position of the snake's head at (0,8) to the target position (1,1) on a grid. The snake can move up, down, left, or right, and each move updates the position of the head while shifting the body segments forward. The goal is to find a valid path from the starting position to the target without causing the head to collide with any part of its own body.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake's body starts at positions [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)] with the head at (0,8).
2. **Move Strategy**:
   - **First Move**: Move the head down from (0,8) to (0,7). This updates the body positions.
   - **Second Move**: Move the head right from (0,7) to (1,7). The body shifts accordingly.
   - **Subsequent Moves**: Continue moving the head down along x=1 until reaching y=1. Each downward move updates the body positions without causing a collision.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial positions of the snake's body and head
body = [(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)]
head = (0, 8)

# Moves to reach target position (1, 1)
moves = [
    ('down', (0, 8), (0, 7)),
    ('right', (0, 7), (1, 7)),
    ('down', (1, 7), (1, 6)),
    ('down', (1, 6), (1, 5)),
    ('down', (1, 5), (1, 4)),
    ('down', (1, 4), (1, 3)),
    ('down', (1, 3), (1, 2)),
    ('down', (1, 2), (1, 1))
]

# Simulate each move
for direction, from_pos, to_pos in moves:
    print(f"Move {direction}: head moves from {from_pos} to {to_pos}")
    # Update the head position and body accordingly (simplified for illustration)
    new_head = to_pos
    body = [new_head] + body[:-1]
    print("New body positions:", body)
    print("New head position:", new_head)
    print("\n")
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Position**: The snake's body is positioned at [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)] with the head at (0,8).
- **First Move**: Moving down from (0,8) to (0,7) updates the body positions.
- **Second Move**: Moving right from (0,7) to (1,7) shifts the body accordingly.
- **Subsequent Moves**: Each downward move along x=1 brings the head closer to y=1 without any collision with the body segments, ensuring a safe path.

This approach ensures that the snake reaches the target position (1,1) efficiently without self-collision.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 8) and whose body cells are in list format [(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)], to eat the apple at (1, 1).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
