========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll need to think through this problem step by step to determine the optimal path for the snake.

Let's start by understanding the current state:

- Snake head position: (7, 6)
- Current direction: UP
- Body cells: [(7, 5)]
- Apple position: (7, 1)

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Current Position and Target:
The snake is currently at (7, 6) moving UP. The target apple is at (7, 1).

Since the current direction is UP, we can't directly reverse to DOWN.

### Direction Vectors:
- UP: (0, 1)
- DOWN: (0, -1)
- LEFT: (-1, 0)
- RIGHT: (1, 0)

### Movement Constraints:
We cannot reverse direction on the first move. So if moving UP, we can't immediately switch to DOWN.

### Path Planning:

From (7, 6) to (7, 1):
- The x-coordinate is already aligned.
- We need to move down by 5 units.

Since our current direction is UP and we cannot reverse to DOWN immediately, we must find a path that eventually gets us there safely while avoiding collisions with the body or grid boundaries.

### Step-by-step Path:
Given the constraints:

1. **FROM (7,6)**:
   - Current Direction: UP

2. **Move LEFT**:
   - New Position: (6, 6)
   - This avoids reversing direction and keeps us on track.

3. **Move RIGHT** (to realign):
   - New Position: (7, 6)

4. **Move DOWN** repeatedly:
   - Sequence of DOWN moves to reach (7,1).

Let's visualize this path:

- Current: (7, 6)
- Move LEFT -> (6, 6)
- Move RIGHT -> (7, 6)
- Now we can move DOWN safely without reversing immediately.

### Final Path:
To avoid immediate reversal and ensure safe movements:
- LEFT
- RIGHT (to realign to our x position)
- Five consecutive DOWN moves

Now let's format this as the required JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move LEFT and RIGHT initially to avoid immediate direction reversal, then perform five DOWN moves to reach the apple safely."
}
```

This path avoids reversing direction immediately after an UP move and ensures we reach the apple at (7,1) without colliding with our body or grid boundaries.
