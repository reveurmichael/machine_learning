========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The apple is directly to the left of the head. Moving LEFT will place the head at (3,1), which is currently occupied by the body. However, since the tail will move next turn (as we are not eating the apple), this move is invalid. The next best move is to move DOWN to (4,0), which is safe and brings the head closer to the apple."
}
```

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me re-analyze:

Given:
- Head: (4,1)
- Direction: RIGHT
- Body: [(3,1)] (this is the segment immediately behind the head)
- Apple: (3,0)

The apple is at (3,0), which is to the left and down from the head.

Current direction is RIGHT, so we cannot reverse to LEFT immediately (rule 2). So the first move cannot be LEFT.

Possible first moves (not reversing):
- UP: (4,2) — but this moves away from the apple.
- DOWN: (4,0) — this is safe (no body there), and brings the head closer to the apple (y decreases by 1).
- RIGHT: (5,1) — moves away from the apple.

So the safest first move is DOWN to (4,0). After this move:
- New head: (4,0)
- Body: [(3,1), (4,1)] (old head added to body)
- Tail is now at (4,1), which will move next turn if we don't eat the apple.

Now, the apple is at (3,0), and the head is at (4,0). Next possible moves:
- Current direction is DOWN (from previous move), so cannot reverse to UP.
- Possible moves: LEFT (3,0) — this is the apple, but we need to check if (3,0) is safe.
  - (3,0) is not occupied by the body (body is at (3,1) and (4,1)), so it's safe.
  - Eating the apple: new head is (3,0), body grows by 1 (no tail removal), so body becomes [(3,1), (4,1), (4,0)].
  - After eating, the tail is at (4,0), and we have space to move (e.g., LEFT is invalid as it would go to (2,0), but no body there, but we need to ensure no immediate trap).

But the apple is at (3,0), and moving LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0) eats the apple, which is safe.

So the sequence is:
1. DOWN to (4,0)
2. LEFT to (3,0) (eats apple)

But the first move cannot be LEFT, but can be DOWN, then LEFT.

But the problem is that after the first move (DOWN), the body is [(3,1), (4,1)], and the head is at (4,0). The apple is at (3,0), which is adjacent to the head (LEFT move). But (3,0) is not occupied by the body (body is at (3,1) and (4,1)), so it's safe.

Thus, the moves are ["DOWN", "LEFT"].

But let's check if this is safe:
- After first move (DOWN): head at (4,0), body [(3,1), (4,1)]. Apple at (3,0).
- Second move (LEFT): head moves to (3,0), eats apple. Body becomes [(3,1), (4,1), (4,0)] (no tail removal).
- After eating, the tail is at (4,0), and we have space to move (e.g., RIGHT to (4,0) is invalid, but other directions are possible).

Thus, this is a safe path.

Final answer:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The first move cannot be LEFT (reverse of current direction), so the safest first move is DOWN to (4,0). From there, moving LEFT to (3,0) eats the apple safely without collisions."
}
