```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake is at (8,4) and the apple is at (7,1). The closest legal move to the apple while avoiding self-collision is LEFT followed by UP. Moving LEFT once gets us closer to the apple and prevents immediate self-collision since there is no body segment to our left. Then moving UP takes us directly towards the apple."
