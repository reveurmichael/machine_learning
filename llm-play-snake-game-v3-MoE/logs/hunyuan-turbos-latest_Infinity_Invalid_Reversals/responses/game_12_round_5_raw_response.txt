```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move right to increase x-coordinate and up/down to adjust y-coordinate. The path avoids the body and ensures no immediate collisions while moving towards the apple."
}
``` 

Wait, let me re-examine the input and plan a more precise path.

Given:
- Head: (6,5)
- Direction: "DOWN"
- Body: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,7)] (from BODY1 to tail)
- Apple: (7,2)

The snake is currently moving DOWN (from head (6,5) to (6,4) next if no move is made). The body segments are:
- BODY1: (6,6) (directly above head)
- BODY2: (5,6) (left of BODY1)
- BODY3: (5,7) (left of BODY2, tail)

The apple is at (7,2), which is to the right and down from the head.

First, let's see the possible moves from current direction "DOWN":
- Cannot reverse to "UP" (invalid move).
- Can choose "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "DOWN" (but "DOWN" is current direction, but not reversing, so allowed? Wait, rules say cannot reverse current direction. Current direction is "DOWN", so cannot choose "UP". "LEFT", "RIGHT", "DOWN" are allowed.

But moving "DOWN" would take head to (6,4), which is not occupied by body (body is at (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)), so safe. But this doesn't help reach apple.

Alternative: move "RIGHT" to (7,5). Check if (7,5) is in body: no. So safe. Then from (7,5), need to move up to decrease y.

But body after move "RIGHT":
- old head (6,5) added to body: body becomes [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]
- apple not eaten, so remove tail (5,7). New body: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]
- head at (7,5)

Now from (7,5), need to move up to (7,6). Check if (7,6) is in body: body is [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. (7,6) not in body, safe. After move:
- old head (7,5) added to body: [(7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]
- apple not eaten, remove tail (5,6). New body: [(7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]
- head at (7,6)

From (7,6), move up to (7,7). Check body: [(7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. (7,7) not in body, safe. After move:
- old head (7,6) added: [(7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]
- remove tail (6,6). New body: [(7,6), (7,5), (6,5)]
- head at (7,7)

From (7,7), move up to (7,8). Check body: [(7,6), (7,5), (6,5)]. (7,8) not in body, safe. After move:
- old head (7,7) added: [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5)]
- remove tail (6,5). New body: [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]
- head at (7,8)

From (7,8), move up to (7,9). Check body: [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]. (7,9) not in body, safe. After move:
- old head (7,8) added: [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]
- remove tail (7,5). New body: [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6)]
- head at (7,9)

Now, head is at (7,9), apple at (7,2). This is not helpful, as we're moving away from the apple in y-direction. This path is wrong.

Alternative approach: move "RIGHT" to (7,5), then "UP" to (7,6), then "LEFT" to (6,6). But (6,6) is in body (BODY1 is (6,6)), so collision. Invalid.

Another path: move "RIGHT" to (7,5), then "UP" to (7,6), then "UP" to (7,7), then "LEFT" to (6,7). Check body after each step:
- After (7,5): body [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]
- After (7,6): body [(7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]
- After (7,7): body [(7,6), (7,5), (6,5)]
- After (6,7): check if (6,7) in body [(7,6), (7,5), (6,5)]. No, safe. Then remove tail (6,5). New body: [(7,6), (7,5), (6,7)]
- head at (6,7)

Now, apple is at (7,2). From (6,7), need to move down to (6,6). Check body [(7,6), (7,5), (6,7)]. (6,6) not in body, safe. After move:
- old head (6,7) added: [(6,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,7)] → wait, no, old head is (6,7), added to front: [(6,7), (7,6), (7,5)], then remove tail (6,7)? No, tail is last element (6,7), so remove it. New body: [(6,7), (7,6), (7,5)] → no, after adding (6,7) to front, body is [(6,7), (7,6), (7,5)], then remove last element (7,5). New body: [(6,7), (7,6)]
- head at (6,6)

Now, apple is at (7,2). From (6,6), move right to (7,6). Check body [(6,7), (7,6)]. (7,6) is in body (BODY1 is (7,6)), so collision. Invalid.

This path is also problematic.

Alternative idea: move "RIGHT" to (7,5), then "DOWN" to (7,4). Check body after (7,5): [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. (7,4) not in body, safe. After move:
- old head (7,5) added: [(7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]
- remove tail (5,6). New body: [(7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]
- head at (7,4)

From (7,4), move down to (7,3). Check body [(7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. (7,3) not in body, safe. After move:
- old head (7,4) added: [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]
- remove tail (6,6). New body: [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5)]
- head at (7,3)

From (7,3), move down to (7,2). Check body [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5)]. (7,2) not in body, safe. After move:
- old head (7,3) added: [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5)]
- remove tail (6,5). New body: [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5)]
- head at (7,2) → apple eaten.

This path works:
1. RIGHT to (7,5)
2. DOWN to (7,4)
3. DOWN to (7,3)
4. DOWN to (7,2)

But current direction is "DOWN", and first move is "RIGHT" (not reversing), valid.

Let's verify no collisions:
- After RIGHT to (7,5): body [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. (7,5) not in body.
- After DOWN to (7,4): body [(7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. (7,4) not in body.
- After DOWN to (7,3): body [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5)]. (7,3) not in body.
- After DOWN to (7,2): body [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5)]. (7,2) not in body.

Also, after eating apple, tail is not removed, so body becomes [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,2)] (old head added). Next move must not collide with body [(7,4), (7,5), (7,2)] (tail is (7,2), but tail moves next turn). So next move can be any direction not reversing current direction (current direction is "DOWN", so cannot "UP"). Can choose "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "DOWN". For example, "LEFT" to (6,2). Check if (6,2) in body [(7,4), (7,5), (7,2)]. No, safe. So path is safe.

Thus, the moves are ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"].

Final JSON:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves right to avoid the body, then moves down three times to reach the apple, ensuring no collisions with the body at any step."
}
