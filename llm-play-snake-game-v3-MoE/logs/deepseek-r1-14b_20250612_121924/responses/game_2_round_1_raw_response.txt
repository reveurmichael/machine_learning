========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (4,6). 

First, I need to understand the current state. The head is at (5,5), and the body is empty since the Body cells list is empty. So the snake's length is just 1 right now. That should make movement easier because there are no body segments blocking the way.

The apple is at (4,6). Let me see the Manhattan distance between the head and the apple. The x-coordinate needs to decrease by 1 (from 5 to 4), and the y-coordinate needs to increase by 1 (from 5 to 6). So in terms of moves, we need one LEFT and one UP.

Since the snake is currently facing NONE direction, which means any first move is allowed. Let's think about possible paths.

Option 1: Move LEFT then UP.
- First move: LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5).
- Second move: UP from (4,5) to (4,6), where the apple is.

I need to check if these moves are safe. After moving LEFT, since there's no body except the head now, moving UP should be fine because the new head would be at (4,6), which isn't occupied by any part of the body after the move.

But wait, when the snake eats the apple on the second move, it will grow. Let me see how that affects future moves. After eating the apple, the body becomes [(5,5), (4,5)] because we add the old head to the front of the body and don't remove the tail since we ate the apple.

So after growing, the snake's body is [ (5,5) as head, (4,5) ].

Now, for the next move after eating the apple, there should be at least one legal move. The new head is at (4,6). What are the possible directions from here? Let me check:

- DOWN would take it to (4,5), which is part of the body now.
- LEFT takes it to (3,6), which might be okay if there's space.
- RIGHT goes back to (5,6), but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, after eating the apple, the next move needs to ensure we don't collide. So from (4,6), possible safe moves could be LEFT or UP again, depending on what's around.

But since the problem only requires planning up to eating the apple, maybe I should focus on getting there without worrying too much about future steps. However, the guidelines say after eating, ensure at least one legal move is available next turn.

So let me think: After moving LEFT then UP to eat the apple, what's the state?

Head: (4,6)
Body: [ (5,5), (4,5) ]

From (4,6), the possible moves are:

- LEFT to (3,6): that cell is empty because the body is at (5,5) and (4,5). So it's safe.
- UP to (4,7): that might be outside the grid? Wait, y ranges from 0 to 9. So 4,7 is valid.

So both LEFT and UP seem possible next moves, which satisfies the condition of having at least one legal move after eating the apple.

Another option: Could I go UP first then LEFT?

First move: UP to (5,6). Then check if that's safe. But wait, current body is empty except head. So moving UP would be (5,6), then next move LEFT to (4,6).

After UP, the new head is at (5,6). The body becomes [(5,5)] after the first move. Then moving LEFT to (4,6) where the apple is.

Then, when eating the apple, the body would be [ (5,6), (5,5) ] since we add the old head (5,6) in front.

From (4,6), next possible moves: Let's see:

- DOWN takes it to (4,5), which is part of the body now.
- LEFT to (3,6): safe.
- UP to (4,7): also safe.

So both options seem viable. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it directly approaches the apple in two steps.

Wait, but let me think about direction constraints. The current direction is NONE, so any first move is allowed. So both options are possible.

But another thing: When the snake grows after eating the apple, does that affect future moves? Since the problem statement requires planning a path to eat the apple safely, and perhaps it's better to have the minimal number of steps.

So moving LEFT then UP would be two moves, which is direct. Alternatively, moving UP then LEFT also takes two moves but may lead to different body positions.

I think either approach should work, but I'll go with the first option: LEFT then UP.

But wait, let me double-check if moving LEFT from (5,5) is allowed without any conflicts. Since the snake's body is empty except for the head, moving LEFT to (4,5) is safe because there are no body segments in between or blocking.

Then, moving UP from (4,5) to (4,6), which is the apple's position. Upon eating the apple, the body becomes [(5,5), (4,5)], and the head is at (4,6). 

After that, the next move can be either LEFT or UP, as both are safe.

So the moves would be ["LEFT", "UP"].
