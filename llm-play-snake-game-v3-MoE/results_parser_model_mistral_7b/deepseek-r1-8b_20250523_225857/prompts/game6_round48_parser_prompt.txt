<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how the snake can safely move from its current position at (1,9) to eat the apple at (0,9). Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the initial setup. The head is at (1,9), which is one unit away from the bottom-left corner of the grid. The direction given is "UP," but that might not be ideal because moving up from (1,9) would take the snake to (1,10), which is outside the grid—so that's a no-go. Wait, actually, in the coordinate system, moving UP increases y by 1. So starting at (1,9), moving UP would take it to (1,10), which is indeed out of bounds. That can't be right because the snake dies if it moves outside the grid. So maybe the initial direction is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system. The bottom-left is (0,0) and top-right is (9,9). So y increases upwards. So at (1,9), moving UP would take it to (1,10), which is out of bounds—so that's not allowed. So maybe the initial direction is "UP" but it can't move in that direction. Hmm, that seems like a problem.

Wait, no—the snake's head can only move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But if moving UP from (1,9) would take it to (1,10), which is outside the grid, then the snake cannot choose to move UP. So maybe the initial direction needs to be changed.

Wait, but the problem says the current direction is "UP," so I have to work with that. But if moving UP from (1,9) causes the head to go out of bounds, does that mean the snake can't move in that direction? Or perhaps it's a mistake, and the initial direction should be something else.

Wait, no—the initial direction is "UP," but maybe the snake can only move in directions where the new head position is within the grid. So from (1,9), moving UP would take it to (1,10), which is outside—so that's invalid. Therefore, the snake cannot choose to move UP; it must change direction.

But the problem states that the current direction is "UP," so perhaps I need to adjust the direction before making any moves. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting something.

Wait, no—the problem says that each move proceeds by computing the new head based on the current direction. So if the current direction is "UP," the next move would be UP unless it's invalid. Since from (1,9), moving UP is outside the grid, that move is invalid. Therefore, the snake cannot make a move in the current direction without causing a collision or going out of bounds.

Therefore, the snake must change direction before making any moves. But according to the movement rules, the first move can't reverse the direction if it's "NONE." Wait, but the initial direction is "UP," which is not NONE. So the snake cannot immediately reverse direction on the first move because that would require changing from UP to DOWN or something else.

Wait, no—the movement rules say that you can't reverse direction unless the current direction is "NONE." So if the current direction is "UP," you can only choose directions other than DOWN on the next move. So after the initial move, which has to be in a non-reversing direction, but since moving UP would take it out of bounds, perhaps the snake must change direction before making any moves.

Wait, but according to the rules, each move proceeds by computing new head based on current direction, then checking for collisions. So if the new_head is invalid (out of bounds or into a body segment), the snake dies. Therefore, the initial direction is "UP," which leads to an invalid move. Therefore, the snake cannot make that move and would die.

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a sequence of moves to reach the apple safely. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something about the coordinate system or the movement rules.

Let me double-check the coordinate system: (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right. So moving UP increases y by 1, so from (1,9), moving UP would take it to (1,10), which is outside. Therefore, moving UP is invalid. So the snake cannot move in that direction.

But according to the rules, each move must be made; if you can't move in the current direction without dying, then perhaps the snake has no legal moves and thus dies. But that's not helpful because we need a path.

Wait, maybe the initial direction is "UP," but the first move can change direction. Wait, no—the movement rules state that on each move, you compute new head based on current direction, check for collisions, then update the body. So the direction cannot be changed mid-move; it's fixed until a reversal occurs.

Wait, no—the direction is updated after each move. But the problem says that each move proceeds by computing new_head based on current direction, so if you're moving in a direction that leads to death, you can't make that move, and thus the snake dies. But since we need to find a safe path, perhaps we need to consider changing directions in such a way that avoids immediate death.

Wait, but from (1,9), the possible moves are:

- UP: (1,10) → invalid
- DOWN: (1,8)
- LEFT: (0,9)
- RIGHT: (2,9)

So moving DOWN or LEFT or RIGHT are valid. But according to the movement rules, you can't reverse direction unless current direction is "NONE." Since initial direction is "UP," you cannot choose "DOWN" on the next move because that would be a reversal.

Wait, no—the movement rules say that you cannot reverse unless current direction is NONE. So if your current direction is UP, you cannot choose DOWN next because that's a reversal. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So from (1,9), initial direction is UP, which leads to an invalid move. Therefore, the snake cannot make any move without dying, which suggests there's no path. But that can't be right because the apple is at (0,9), which is adjacent.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the rules. Let me read again: you cannot reverse direction unless current direction is NONE. So if current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next. So moving LEFT from UP is allowed because it's not a reversal. Similarly, RIGHT is also allowed.

Wait, so from (1,9), initial direction is UP, but since moving UP is invalid, the snake cannot make that move and would die. Therefore, the snake must change direction before making any moves.

But according to the rules, each move proceeds by computing new head based on current direction, regardless of whether it's valid or not. So if you can't compute a valid new_head, then the snake dies.

Wait, but in reality, the snake would try all possible directions and choose one that doesn't lead to immediate death. But according to the problem statement, each move is made by choosing a direction, computing new head, checking for collisions (using the state before body shifts), then updating.

So perhaps the initial direction is "UP," but since moving UP is invalid, the snake cannot make any move and dies. Therefore, there's no safe path.

But that contradicts the problem statement which asks to plan a safe path. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial setup.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the head position is (1,9), direction is "UP," body cells are [(1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)], and apple is at (0,9).

So the snake's body from head to tail is:

HEAD: (1,9)

BODY1: (1,8)

BODY2: (2,8)

BODY3: (3,8)

BODY4: (4,8)

BODY5: (5,8)

So the snake is moving to the right along y=8 from (1,8) to (5,8). So the head is at (1,9), which is above (1,8).

Now, when considering movement, each move must be in a direction that doesn't cause immediate death.

From (1,9), possible directions:

- UP: (1,10) → invalid
- DOWN: (1,8) → which is BODY1
- LEFT: (0,9)
- RIGHT: (2,9)

So moving DOWN would take the snake into its own body, which is illegal unless it's the tail's current cell when the tail is about to move.

Wait, according to rule 3, checking collisions:

If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies.

So if moving DOWN takes head to (1,8), which is BODY1, then it's a collision because BODY1 is not the tail's current cell. The tail is at (5,8), so moving into (1,8) would be a collision.

Therefore, moving DOWN is invalid.

Similarly, moving LEFT to (0,9): is that position occupied by any body cells? The body cells are from (1,8) up to (5,8). So (0,9) is empty. Therefore, moving LEFT is valid.

Moving RIGHT to (2,9): also empty, so that's valid.

So the snake can move either LEFT or RIGHT on the first move without causing immediate death.

But according to rule 2, cannot reverse unless current direction is NONE. Since current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

Wait, no—rule 2 says: "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', then you can reverse."

So if the current direction is UP, you cannot choose DOWN next because that's a reversal. Similarly, choosing LEFT or RIGHT from UP is allowed because those are not reverses.

Wait, but moving LEFT from UP is considered a non-reversal? Or is it considered a left turn?

I think in this context, "reversing" means changing direction to the opposite. So if you're going up and then choose to go down, that's a reversal. Going left or right from up is not a reversal.

Therefore, moving LEFT or RIGHT from UP is allowed because they are not reversals.

So from (1,9), possible first moves are LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9).

But the apple is at (0,9), which is adjacent. So perhaps the optimal path is to move LEFT to (0,9) and then adjust direction accordingly.

Wait, but after moving LEFT to (0,9), what's the new head position? It would be (0,9). Then, next move: can it move further LEFT? No, because that would take it off the grid. Or can it move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT?

But moving UP from (0,9) would take it to (0,10), which is invalid.

Moving DOWN to (0,8): is that occupied by any body cells? The body is at (1,8), (2,8), etc., so (0,8) is empty. So moving DOWN is allowed.

But also, from (0,9), moving RIGHT to (1,9) would bring it back to its original position.

Wait, but the snake needs to reach the apple at (0,9). So perhaps the first move is LEFT to (0,9), and then stop? Because the head is already at (0,9), which is the apple. Wait, no—the head must be moved into the apple's position to collect it.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe the snake can collect the apple by moving into its cell. So if the head moves into (0,9), then the apple is collected.

But in this case, the initial move would take the head from (1,9) to (0,9), which is the apple. Then, the snake has reached the apple, so maybe that's the end.

But I'm not sure if the problem allows for that. Maybe the snake needs to have its head at the apple's position to collect it, but also, perhaps there are other constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can't move into the apple unless it's following a certain path.

Wait, no—the problem doesn't specify any such constraints. So if the snake moves LEFT from (1,9) to (0,9), that's the apple's position, and thus the snake has reached the goal.

But wait, let me check again: movement rules state that each move computes new_head based on current direction, checks for collisions (body cells except possibly tail's current cell), then updates body.

So moving LEFT from (1,9) to (0,9): is (0,9) occupied by any body cell? No. So it's a valid move.

Therefore, the snake can make this move and reach the apple.

But wait, in that case, the snake's head would be at (0,9), which is the apple's position, so perhaps that's all that's needed.

Alternatively, maybe the snake needs to have its entire body on the apple's cell, but I don't think that's specified.

So, possible path:

Move 1: LEFT from (1,9) to (0,9). Now head is at (0,9), which is the apple. So the snake has reached the goal.

Therefore, the sequence is simply "LEFT."

But wait, let me check if there are any other constraints or potential issues.

When moving into (0,9), does the body shift occur? Let's see:

After moving to (0,9), the new head is at (0,9). The previous head was at (1,9), which is now part of the body. So the snake's body would be from (1,9) down to (5,8), and then the head is at (0,9).

Wait, but in this case, the body includes all previous positions except the new head. So the new head is (0,9); the body is [ (0,9), (1,9), (2,9)... ]? No, wait—the snake's body is built from the tail to the old head.

Wait no—when a snake moves, it adds a new segment at the front and removes the last segment. So in this case, moving LEFT would take the head from (1,9) to (0,9), and the tail would remain at (5,8). Therefore, the body becomes [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,9) ].

Wait, no—that doesn't make sense because when moving forward, each segment follows the one in front. So if the head moves to (0,9), then the previous segments are (5,8), (4,8), ..., (1,9). But after moving, the tail would drop a segment.

So the new body would be [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,9) ] because the snake has grown by one segment. Wait, but that's not right—snakes don't grow; they just move their head and lose a tail segment.

Wait, no—the problem doesn't specify whether the snake can grow or not. But in most cases, snakes don't grow when moving; they just shift their body segments. So when the head moves to (0,9), the tail's last segment at (5,8) is now free, so the body becomes:

[ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,9) ].

Wait, but that would mean the snake has grown by one segment. But I think in this problem, we can assume the snake's length remains constant, so perhaps the tail doesn't drop a segment unless it's necessary. Or maybe the body shifts occur as per normal movement.

But regardless of that, moving LEFT to (0,9) is a valid move and reaches the apple.

Therefore, the sequence is simply "LEFT."

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if there are any other constraints I'm missing. For example, after moving to (0,9), can the snake then make another move? Well, once the head is at (0,9), which is the apple's position, perhaps that's sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe the snake needs to have its entire body on the apple's cell, but I don't think so because the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for a sequence of moves to reach the apple.

Therefore, the minimal path is one move: LEFT from (1,9) to (0,9).

But let me double-check the movement rules again:

- Each move: compute new_head based on current direction.
- Check if new_head is out of bounds → invalid
- Check if new_head is in any body cell except possibly the tail's current cell → collision, so invalid
- If valid, update body: add new_head to front, remove tail's last segment

So moving from (1,9) LEFT to (0,9): is that a valid move?

- (0,9) is not out of bounds.
- The body cells are [(1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)], so (0,9) isn't in the body → no collision
Therefore, it's valid.

So yes, moving LEFT once gets the snake to (0,9), which is the apple. Therefore, the answer is "LEFT."

But wait, perhaps I should consider other possible paths as well. For example, if the snake moves RIGHT first, then what?

From (1,9), moving RIGHT to (2,9): is that a valid move? Yes.

Then from (2,9), where can it go next? Let's see:

Possible directions:

UP: (2,10) → invalid
DOWN: (2,8)
LEFT: (1,9)
RIGHT: (3,9)

Now, checking for collisions:

- DOWN to (2,8): body cells are [(1,8), (2,8), ..., (5,8)], so (2,8) is BODY2 → collision unless it's the tail's current cell. The tail is at (5,8); moving into (2,8) would be a collision because (2,8) is not the tail's current cell.

Therefore, moving DOWN from (2,9) to (2,8) is invalid.

Moving LEFT to (1,9): body includes (1,8), which is different from (1,9). So no collision.

But also, moving LEFT would take it back to (1,9), which might not be useful.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,9).

Is (3,9) occupied by any body cells? Body cells are [(5,8), (4,8), ..., (1,8)], so no. So moving RIGHT is valid.

So from (2,9), moving RIGHT to (3,9): valid.

Then from (3,9), next move:

Possible directions:

UP: invalid
DOWN: (3,8) → which is BODY3 → collision unless it's the tail.
But current tail is at (5,8). So no, can't move DOWN as (3,8) is occupied by body.

LEFT to (2,9): valid, but maybe not helpful.

RIGHT to (4,9): valid.

So moving RIGHT again: from (3,9) to (4,9).

Then from (4,9), next move:

DOWN to (4,8): which is BODY4 → collision unless it's the tail. Tail is at (5,8). So can't move DOWN.

LEFT to (3,9): valid.

RIGHT to (5,9): valid.

Moving RIGHT to (5,9).

From there, moving further RIGHT would be off the grid.

Then from (5,9), possible moves:

DOWN: (5,8) → tail's current cell. So moving DOWN is allowed because it's the tail's position.

So from (5,9), move DOWN to (5,8): valid.

Now, head is at (5,8), which is the tail's original position. Then what?

From (5,8), possible moves:

UP: (5,9) → previous position
DOWN: invalid (as it would go below grid)
LEFT: (4,8) → body cell (BODY5) → collision unless it's the tail.

Wait, the tail is now at (5,8). So moving LEFT to (4,8): which was BODY5. But since we've moved away from there, is (4,8) considered a body cell? Yes, because it's part of the original snake.

Therefore, moving LEFT would result in collision unless (4,8) is the tail's current position, but it isn't—it's at (5,8).

So moving LEFT is invalid.

Similarly, moving RIGHT from (5,8): to (6,8), which is off the grid—invalid.

Moving UP: (5,9)—valid, as it was previous position. But that would just take us back to where we were before.

Therefore, this path seems like a loop unless we find another way.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different path from (4,9) that doesn't require going all the way down.

But regardless, the minimal path is "LEFT" as previously thought.

So after considering both possible first moves (LEFT and RIGHT), the LEFT move immediately gets the snake to the apple's position. Therefore, the answer is simply moving LEFT once.
</think>

The shortest path for the snake to reach the apple at (0,9) is a single move: moving left from (1,9) to (0,9). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Starting Position:** The snake's head starts at (1,9).
2. **First Move:** The snake moves LEFT to position (0,9), which is the location of the apple.
3. **Result:** The snake has successfully reached the apple by moving into its cell.

**Answer:** Move left once: "LEFT."
