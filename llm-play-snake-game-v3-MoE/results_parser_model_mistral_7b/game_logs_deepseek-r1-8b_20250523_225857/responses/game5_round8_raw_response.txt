========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from its current position at (6,1) to eat the apple at (7,0). Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial setup. The snake's head is at (6,1), and it's facing LEFT since the direction is "LEFT". The body cells list is empty, meaning the snake has no segments behind the head. The apple is located at (7,0).

Given that the snake can't reverse direction on its first move, I need to think about the possible directions it can go. Since it's currently facing LEFT, the next move can't be DOWN or UP right away; it has to either continue going LEFT or choose another direction after that.

But wait, if it goes LEFT from (6,1), it would end up at (5,1). However, this might not be the most efficient path towards the apple at (7,0). So maybe moving in a different direction initially is better.

Alternatively, the snake could start by moving DOWN since there's no restriction on reversing directions after the first move. Moving DOWN from (6,1) would take it to (6,0), which is closer to the apple but still not directly adjacent.

From (6,0), if the snake moves RIGHT, it can reach (7,0), which is the position of the apple. However, I need to ensure that this path doesn't cause any collisions or get trapped.

Let me simulate this path:

1. Move DOWN from (6,1) to (6,0).
2. Then move RIGHT to (7,0).

But wait, when moving to (6,0), is there a body segment blocking the way? Initially, the body cells are empty, so it should be safe.

Upon reaching (7,0), the snake eats the apple, which means the tail doesn't move this turn. This allows the snake to grow by one segment without losing any length.

So the moves would be: DOWN, then RIGHT. That's two moves in total.

Let me check if there are any potential issues with this path. After eating the apple, the snake will have grown by one segment, making its body longer. However, since it just ate the apple, on the next move, it needs to have a legal move available. In this case, after moving to (7,0), the next possible moves would be LEFT or UP if it's facing RIGHT, but that might not be necessary as the goal is already achieved.

Another consideration is whether the snake can actually make these moves without reversing direction. The initial move from (6,1) to (6,0) is DOWN, which is allowed since there was no prior direction restriction except on the first move.

I also need to ensure that the body remains continuous after each move. Since the snake starts with an empty body, moving down doesn't cause any issues. Then moving right would have the head at (7,0), and the body segments would follow correctly.

So this seems like a valid path. The moves are straightforward: first DOWN, then RIGHT.

{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake will move downward to (6,0) and then right to (7,0), safely eating the apple with no immediate risk of trapping."
