<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (6,9), and the apple is at (4,7). The current direction is UP, so the first move can't be DOWN. The body is in positions [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)]. Wait, the head is at (6,9), so the body parts are behind it. Let me visualize the grid. The head is at (6,9), which is the top row. The body parts are from (6,8) down to (8,5). So the body is in a vertical line on the right side.

The goal is to get to (4,7). Let's think about the path. The head needs to move left twice (from x=6 to x=4) and down twice (from y=9 to y=7). But the current direction is UP, so first move can't be DOWN. Let's check possible first moves. The snake can't reverse direction, so first move can't be DOWN. So possible first moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But moving UP would take the head to (6,10), which is outside the grid (since y ranges up to 9). So UP is invalid. So the first move can't be UP. So the first move options are LEFT or RIGHT. Wait, the current direction is UP, so the snake can't move DOWN next. But the first move is allowed to be LEFT or RIGHT, as long as they don't reverse. Wait, the current direction is UP, so the next move can't be DOWN. So first move options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. But moving UP from (6,9) would take the head to (6,10), which is out of bounds. So that's not allowed. So the first move must be LEFT or RIGHT. Let me check.

If the snake moves LEFT first, from (6,9) to (5,9). Let's check if that position is occupied by the body. The body parts are at (6,8), (6,7), etc. So (5,9) is not part of the body. That's safe. Alternatively, moving RIGHT would take the head to (7,9). Is (7,9) in the body? The body parts are [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)]. So (7,9) isn't in the body. So both LEFT and RIGHT are possible first moves. But which one is better?

The apple is at (4,7), which is to the left and down from the current head. So moving left first might be better. Let's try that.

So first move: LEFT to (5,9). Then, next move? The snake can't go RIGHT (reverse direction if previous was LEFT). Wait, the current direction after first move is LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT. So from (5,9), the next move can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But moving UP would go to (5,10), which is out of bounds. So options are DOWN or LEFT. Let's think.

If we move DOWN from (5,9) to (5,8). Is that position safe? The body parts include (6,8), but (5,8) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then, from (5,8), the direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP. So possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Let's see. Need to get to (4,7). So moving left again would take us to (4,8). Then, from there, move down to (4,7). That would be the apple. But need to check if the path is safe.

Let me outline the steps:

Move 1: LEFT (from (6,9) to (5,9))

Move 2: DOWN (from (5,9) to (5,8))

Move 3: LEFT (from (5,8) to (4,8))

Move 4: DOWN (from (4,8) to (4,7)) → that's the apple.

Now check for collisions. After each move, the body shifts.

Original body is [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)].

After first move (LEFT to 5,9):

The new head is (5,9), and the body is updated. The tail is removed unless apple is eaten. Since the apple isn't eaten yet, the tail (the last element of the body list) is removed. Original body is [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)]. So the tail is (6,8). So after moving, the new body is [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)] plus the new head (5,9) added to the front. Wait, no. The movement rules say that the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. So the body after the first move would be the previous body with the tail (6,8) removed, and the new head (5,9) inserted at the front. So the body becomes [(5,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)]? No, wait. The body list is the positions of the body excluding the head. So when the head moves, the body shifts. The original body is [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)], and the head is at (6,9). After moving left to (5,9), the new head is (5,9), and the body becomes [(6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)]? Wait, no. Because the body is the segments after the head. So when the head moves, the previous head becomes the next segment. So the original head (6,9) becomes the new body's first segment, and the rest of the body shifts. Wait, maybe I need to think about how the body is updated.

The movement process is:

- New head = current head + direction.

- The new head becomes the first segment of the body.

- The tail is removed unless the apple was eaten (then the tail remains).

But in this case, the apple hasn't been eaten yet, so the tail is removed.

Original body (excluding head) is [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)].

After moving left, the new head is (5,9). The previous head (6,9) is added to the body (as the next segment), and the tail (6,8) is removed. So the new body is [(6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)].

So after first move, the body is [(6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)].

Now, in the second move, moving down to (5,8). So the new head is (5,8). The previous head (5,9) becomes part of the body. The tail is now (6,7), which is removed. So the body becomes [(5,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6)].

Then third move: left to (4,8). The new head is (4,8). The previous head (5,8) is added to the body. The tail (6,6) is removed. Body becomes [(5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)].

Fourth move: down to (4,7). The new head is (4,7). Now, since the apple is at (4,7), this move would eat the apple. So the tail is not removed. The body becomes [(4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)] (since the tail isn't removed because the apple was eaten). Now, after eating, the snake has a new segment. But the next move must be safe. Let's check if after eating, the snake can move.

After eating, the next move can't be in a direction that would cause collision. Let's think about that. The head is at (4,7), and the body is [(4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)]. So the next move can't be into the body. Possible moves: from (4,7), the snake can move up (to 4,8), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. So moving up is invalid. Down to (4,6), which is safe. Left to (3,7), which is safe. Right to (5,7), which is safe. So after eating, the snake can move in those directions. So the path is safe.

But let's check the entire path for collisions. Let's go step by step.

First move: (6,9) → (5,9). Safe. The body after move 1 is [(6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)]. So (5,9) is not in the body.

Second move: (5,9) → (5,8). Body after move 2 is [(5,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6)]. So (5,8) is not in the body.

Third move: (5,8) → (4,8). Body after move 3 is [(5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)]. (4,8) is not in the body.

Fourth move: (4,8) → (4,7). That's the apple. Now the body after eating is [(4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)], and the head is (4,7). The next move must be safe. As discussed, possible moves are down, left, right. So that's okay.

So the moves would be LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN. But wait, let's check the direction changes. The initial direction is UP. The first move is LEFT, which is allowed (no reversal). Then the direction is LEFT. The second move is DOWN, which is allowed. Third move is LEFT again (direction is now DOWN, so next move can't be UP. Wait, the direction after move 2 is DOWN. So the third move is LEFT, which is allowed. Then, the fourth move is DOWN again. The direction after move 3 is LEFT, so the fourth move is DOWN, which is allowed. So the directions are all valid.

But let me check the number of left and right moves, and up and down. The required is:

Left - right = 2 (from x=6 to x=4, so 6-4=2). So total left moves minus right moves should be 2. In this path, there are two left moves (moves 1 and 3) and no right moves. So 2-0=2, which is correct.

For the y direction: down - up = 2 (from y=9 to y=7). The moves are two downs (moves 2 and 4). So 2-0=2. Correct.

So the moves are valid in terms of the required displacement.

But is there a shorter path? Let's see. The Manhattan distance from (6,9) to (4,7) is (6-4) + (9-7) = 2 + 2 = 4. So four moves. The path I outlined is four moves. So that's optimal.

But need to make sure that there are no collisions during the moves. Let me check again.

Move 1: (6,9) → (5,9). No collision.

Move 2: (5,9) → (5,8). No collision.

Move 3: (5,8) → (4,8). No collision.

Move 4: (4,8) → (4,7). No collision. Then, after eating, the snake can move.

So this seems safe. So the moves would be ["LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN"].

Another possible path: moving right first. Let's see. Suppose the first move is RIGHT to (7,9). Then, the body after that would be [(6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)] (since the tail is removed). Then, moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), but (6,8) is part of the body (original body had (6,8) before the first move, but after the first move, the body is [(6,9), ...]. Wait, let me think again. After first move RIGHT to (7,9), the body becomes [(6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)]. Then moving down to (7,8). Then, moving left to (6,8) which is part of the body. Wait, the body after the first move includes (6,8)? No. The original body was [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)]. After the first move (RIGHT to (7,9)), the body is [(6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)]. So (6,8) is not in the body. Then moving down to (7,8), then left to (6,8). That's safe. Then down to (6,7). But (6,7) is in the body. Wait, after moving left to (6,8), the body would be [(7,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6)]. Then moving down to (6,8) → (6,7). (6,7) is in the body (the body after that move would be [(6,8), (7,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)]). So (6,7) is part of the body? Wait, the body after that move would be [(6,8), (7,9), (6,9), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)]. So (6,7) is not in the body. So moving down to (6,7) would be safe. Then, the path would be RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN. That's five moves. So longer than the previous path. So the first path is better.

Therefore, the optimal path is the first one: LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN.
</think>

To determine the optimal and collision-free sequence of moves from position $(6, 9)$ to the target position $(4, 7)$, we analyze both the displacement and the potential for collisions during movement.

---

### 🎯 **Objective**

- **Starting position**: $(6, 9)$
- **Target position**: $(4, 7)$
- **Goal**: Reach the target in the **fewest number of moves**, ensuring **no collision with the body segments** along the way.

---

### 📏 **Manhattan Distance**

The Manhattan distance between the start and target is:

$$
|6 - 4| + |9 - 7| = 2 + 2 = 4
$$

This suggests that the **minimum number of moves** required is **4**, assuming no obstacles.

---

### 🧭 **Path Selection**

Let’s explore the following path:

1. **Move Left** from $(6, 9)$ to $(5, 9)$
2. **Move Down** to $(5, 8)$
3. **Move Left** to $(4, 8)$
4. **Move Down** to $(4, 7)$ (target)

This path is:

- **4 moves** (optimal)
- **No collisions** with any body segments
- **Direction changes** are valid and do not involve reversing (e.g., after moving Left, moving Down is acceptable)

---

### ✅ **Collision Check**

We simulate each step and track the body:

- **Initial body** (excluding head): `[(8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)]`
- **After move 1 (Left to (5, 9))**: New head is (5, 9), body becomes: `[(6, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)]`
- **After move 2 (Down to (5, 8))**: New head is (5, 8), body becomes: `[(5, 9), (6, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6)]`
- **After move 3 (Left to (4, 8))**: New head is (4, 8), body becomes: `[(5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)]`
- **After move 4 (Down to (4, 7))**: New head is (4, 7), body becomes: `[(4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)]` (since the apple is eaten, the tail is **not** removed)

No position along this path is occupied by the body at any step, confirming the path is **collision-free**.

---

### 🧮 **Displacement Verification**

- **Left moves**: 2 (moves 1 and 3)
- **Right moves**: 0
- **Left - Right = 2** ✅
- **Down moves**: 2 (moves 2 and 4)
- **Up moves**: 0
- **Down - Up = 2** ✅

---

### 🚦 **After Reaching the Target**

The head is now at $(4, 7)$, and the body is:

`[(4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)]`

From this position, the next valid moves are: **Down**, **Left**, or **Right** — all safe and do not lead to a collision.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

The optimal and safe path from $(6, 9)$ to $(4, 7)$ is:

$$
\boxed{["LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN"]}
$$
```
