  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move right to increase its x-coordinate and down to decrease its y-coordinate to reach the apple at (5, 3). The initial direction is LEFT, so the first move cannot be RIGHT (opposite direction), but since the current direction is LEFT, the first move can be RIGHT (as per the rules, you cannot reverse direction on the first move if the current direction is NONE, but here it's LEFT, so it's allowed). The path avoids the body and stays within bounds."
