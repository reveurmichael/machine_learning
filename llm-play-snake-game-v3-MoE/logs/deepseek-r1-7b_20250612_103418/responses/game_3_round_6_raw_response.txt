========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to solve this problem where a snake is at (8,5) and needs to reach an apple at (1,8). The snake's current direction is UP, but it also has some body segments: [(8,4), (8,3)]. So the head is at (8,5), followed by two body parts moving DOWN. 

First, I need to figure out how many moves it will take for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with itself or getting stuck. Since the snake can't reverse direction on its first move, that means if it's currently UP, the next move can't be DOWN.

Looking at the positions, moving LEFT seems like a good initial step because the head is at x=8 and needs to get to x=1, which requires seven steps LEFT (since 8-7=1). The apple is also three steps above in y-coordinate: from y=5 to y=8. So it's eight steps UP.

But wait, that might not be accurate because the snake can't just move directly towards the apple without considering its body segments and possible future positions. Let me think about each step carefully.

Starting at (8,5), if I choose LEFT first:
- The new head would be at (7,5). 
- I need to check for collisions. The current body is [(8,4), (8,3)]. So the new head's position isn't blocked yet.
- The snake will move by inserting the old head into the front of the body list and removing the tail unless it eats an apple.

After moving LEFT once:
- New full S would be [(7,5)] as the head, with the body being [ (8,4), (8,3) ] because we didn't eat any apple yet. Wait, no—actually, when you move, you insert the old head into the front of the body list and remove the tail unless it's an apple.

Wait, in this case, since we moved to LEFT without eating the apple, the new head is (7,5), then the body becomes [(8,4), (8,3)] but since the snake didn't eat anything, we need to remove the last element of the body. Wait no—initially, the body was [ (8,4), (8,3) ] because those are behind the head.

Wait no: The current state is:
Head at (8,5)
Body cells: [(8,4), (8,3)]

So when we move LEFT to (7,5):
- New HEAD is (7,5).
- Insert old head (8,5) into the front of the body list.
- Then remove the tail. Since it's not an apple case, the tail is removed.

Wait no: The current snake S is [head] + body1 + body2... So when moving, we add the new head to the front and then append the previous head position (if growing) or just the body segments minus one if not eating. 

Actually, in movement step 3:
a. Insert old_head into the front of the body list.
b. If apple is eaten, don't remove tail; else, remove last element.

So after moving LEFT once without eating:

New head: (7,5)
Body becomes [ (8,5) ] because we removed the last element from the previous body [(8,4), (8,3)]. 

Wait no—because the current body is [(8,4), (8,3)], which are behind the head. So when moving to LEFT:

- The new head is at (7,5).
- Insert old head into the front of the body list: so now S becomes [ (8,5) ] followed by [(8,4), (8,3)].
- Then remove last element unless it's apple.

Wait no—the movement step 3a says insert the old_head at the front, and then step 3b decides whether to keep or remove tail. 

So S after moving is:

[ new_head ] + [ body list ]

But when not eating an apple, we need to drop the last element of the current body.

Wait no: The initial snake is HEAD followed by BODY1 and BODY2 (in this case, two segments). When you move left, you add the old head as the new head, then shift all others. Then, since it's not eating an apple, we remove the tail—so the body becomes [ (8,4) ], because after moving, the new S would be [(7,5), (8,4), (8,3)] and then we remove the last element to become [(7,5), (8,4)]. Wait no: The movement step says:

a. Insert old head into front.
b. If not eating apple, remove tail.

So current body is [ (8,4), (8,3) ] before moving. After inserting new_head=(7,5) at front:
S becomes [ (7,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

Then, since it's not an apple case, we need to remove the tail: so remove last element.

Wait but step 3b says:

If new head is apple position → grow by adding new_head without removing tail.
Else → move normally, which removes the last element of the body list (the tail).

So in this case, since moving LEFT from (8,5) to (7,5) doesn't result in eating an apple (apple is at (1,8)), so we remove the tail.

Thus, new S becomes [ (7,5), (8,4) ]. So the body now only has two segments: the old head and the previous first body part. 

So after one LEFT move:
- Head is at (7,5)
- Body is [(8,4)]
- The snake's length was 3 before moving? Wait no—initially, the snake had a head plus two body parts: total of three segments.

Wait initial state:

Head is at (8,5). Body cells are [ (8,4), (8,3) ]. So that makes S = [head, body1, body2] → 3 segments. After moving LEFT once without eating apple:

Insert old head to front: new S becomes [ (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

But since it's not an apple case, we remove the tail (which is (8,3)), resulting in S = [ (7,5), (8,5), (8,4) ].

Wait no—because according to movement update rule 2:

When moving without eating apple, after inserting old head into front of body list, we need to remove last element. So initial body is [(8,4), (8,3)]. After step a: S becomes [new_head] + old_body → [7,5; 8,4; 8,3]. Then in step b, since not eating apple, remove the tail, which was the last element of current_body. But wait—current_body is [(8,4), (8,3)], so after inserting new_head at front, the body becomes [8,5, 8,4, 8,3]. Then we have to decide whether to keep or drop the last.

Wait no—the initial S before movement was:

S = [ head(8,5), 8,4; 8,3 ]

In step a: Insert old_head (8,5) into front of body list. So new S becomes [ 7,5 (new head); 8,4; 8,3 ].

Then in step b:

Since not eating apple, we remove the last element of the current_body (the tail). The body was [(8,4), (8,3)], so after inserting, it's [ (8,5) is now new head, followed by previous head at (8,4) and then body cell (8,3)]. So to move normally, we remove the last element.

So new S becomes:

[ 7,5; 8,4 ] → because we removed 8,3.

But wait—no. Because in step a, after inserting, the full list is [7,5], followed by old_body: [(8,4), (8,3)]. So when moving without eating apple, body becomes [8,4].

Wait no—the initial S had head at (8,5) and body1, body2 as (8,4) and (8,3). After movement:

- Insert new_head into front: S is now [(7,5), 8,4; 8,3 ]
- Then remove the tail unless it's apple.

Since not eating, we have to remove last element. So after removing, body becomes [ (7,5); (8,4) ].

Wait no—that doesn't make sense because S should be [new_head] followed by all previous except the tail?

No—the initial snake was 3 segments: head at (8,5), then two body parts (8,4 and 8,3). After moving left:

- Insert new head to front → [7,5; 8,4; 8,3]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element of current_body.

Wait the problem says that step a is inserting old_head into front of body list. So after movement, S becomes:

[ new_head ] + previous_body_list

But then in step b, if not eating, we have to remove tail (the last element of the current_body). The current_body before moving was [8,4; 8,3], but since we inserted new_head at front, it's now [7,5; 8,4; 8,3]. So step b says if not eating apple, then we need to remove last element. But the snake after movement would be:

[ (7,5) ] followed by the previous body list minus tail.

Wait no—because in step a, you insert new_head into front of current_body. Then S is [new_head] + old_body_list.

Then if not apple case, in step b: we remove the last element of the body.

So initial S after movement:

- Before movement: head = 8,5; body = [8,4; 8,3]

- After a: new_S_part1 is [7,5] + old_body → [7,5;8,4;8,3]

- Then step b: remove last element (tail) if not eating.

So S becomes [7,5;8,4].

Thus the snake's body now has two segments: head at 7,5 and first body part at 8,4. 

That makes sense because the tail was removed to move forward.

Okay, so after moving LEFT once:

- Head is at (7,5)
- Body is [ (8,4) ]
- Next positions need to be checked for collision with new head or existing body cells.

Now, let's check if this position would cause a collision. The next cell the snake is trying to move into is (7,5). 

But are there any parts of the body in that area? Current body after movement:

[ (7,5) ] → no, because we just moved from 8,5 to 7,5.

Wait the current S after step a and b is [7,5; 8,4], so the snake's body cells are [(8,4)] as part of its body. So moving to (7,5) doesn't cause any conflict because no other body parts are at that position yet.

So now we can proceed without any collision issues.

But wait—another thing: The current snake has head at 7,5 and the body is at 8,4. So next move would have to ensure it's moving towards (1,8).

Continuing on this path:

Each LEFT step will take us closer to x=0, but we also need to consider that the y-coordinate needs to increase from 5 to 8.

If I continue moving LEFT each time without eating apple, let me see how many steps it would take. 

From (8,5) → Left:7,5
Left again:6,5
Left:5,5
4,5;3,5;2,5;1,5

Then at x=1, y is 5. But the apple is at (1,8). So that's a lot more steps up.

So maybe after getting to (1,5), I need to move UP multiple times to reach y=8.

But wait—how would I navigate around without hitting my own body? Because when moving left, the snake could potentially create loops or block itself. 

Alternatively, perhaps instead of just moving LEFT every time, the snake can find a path upwards towards (1,8). Let's think about this in terms of grid positions.

Looking at the current head position: 8,5

If I move UP once:
- New head would be (8,6)
- Then body becomes [7,5] and remove tail if not eating apple.

Wait let me retrace:

After first LEFT step, S is [(7,5), (8,4)]

So moving from (7,5) to 8,6?

Is that possible? Let's see.

Move UP: new head at (8,6)
Insert old head into front of body list [ (8,4) ] → S becomes [8,6;7,5]
Since it's not apple case, we remove last element. So new S is [8,6]

Wait no—current_body before movement was [(8,4)]. After inserting new_head=(7,5) at front:

S after step a: [ (7,5), 8,4 ]

But wait that can't be right because the head moves to (8,6). So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait no—movement is done by moving in one direction. The previous movement was LEFT from 8,5 →7,5. Now we are considering moving UP next step.

So after initial steps:

- Head at 7,5
- Body: [8,4]

Next move: UP

New head will be (7,6)

Insert old_head=(7,5) into front of body list [8,4]:

S becomes [ (7,5), 7,6; 8,4 ]

Wait no—that doesn't make sense because the movement is in one direction.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

Each movement step involves moving only once—either LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

After the first move, which was LEFT to (7,5), the body list became [8,4].

Now for the next move, choosing to move UP would place head at 7,6.

But we need to insert this into S:

S after step a is new_head added in front of body → [7,6; 7,5]. Then because it's not an apple case, remove last element (8,4) ?

Wait no—no. Wait: The current body before moving was [(8,4)]. After inserting the old head at front:

S becomes [ (7,6), (8,4) ]

Then step b: since it's not an apple move, we need to remove the last element of the body list.

So after movement and step b, S is:

[ 7,6; 7,5 ] → because we removed (8,4). But wait—does that make sense?

No. Because current_body was [ (8,4) ], so after inserting new_head into front: it's [ (7,6), 8,4 ]

Then step b says to remove last element if not apple.

So now the S becomes:

[ (7,6) ] because we only kept one segment? Or is it that when removing the tail, you have just head and previous head?

Wait no—no. Let me think differently: 

When you move UP from 7,5 to 7,6:

- Insert old_head into front of body list → which was [ (8,4) ]

So new S after step a is [(7,6), 8,4]

But since it's not an apple case, we have to remove the tail. The current_body is only one element: [8,4]. So removing that would leave us with just the head?

Wait no—because if you had a snake like:

[ (7,5) ] as body1, then move UP.

No—I think I'm mixing up steps here.

Perhaps it's better to model each movement step correctly according to the rules.

Let me try again. Current state after first LEFT move:
- Head at 7,5
- Body: [8,4]

Now moving UP:

Step a: Insert old_head (7,5) into front of body list → new_S_before_removal is [(7,6), (7,5), (8,4)]

Wait no—the current head after first move was 7,5. So when moving to 7,6, the insertion should be:

Inserting old_head at position before body.

So if current snake S is [head; ...body...], then inserting new_head into front would make it [new_head; head; ...body...]

But in this case, the current_body was [(8,4)], so after step a, S becomes [7,6; 7,5].

Then step b: since not eating apple, remove last element. So body is now just [7,6]?

Wait that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps I should think of the snake as moving forward each time—so when you move in direction D, you shift all your body parts into the new position behind you.

But given that this seems complicated, maybe it's better to use a step-by-step approach for each movement and check for collisions.

Another consideration is that after several moves left, the snake may have to turn around or find another path towards (1,8).

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT until x=0 might not be efficient because then the y would need to increase from 5 to 8. So maybe a more optimal strategy is needed.

Wait—maybe the snake can't move all left first; after some lefts, it needs to turn up and right.

But given that it's currently at (8,5), with body behind, moving right or down would be dangerous because it might hit itself.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is:

Move RIGHT once: from 8,5 →9,5. Then move DOWN multiple times to reach the apple.

But initial position is x=8; going right would take it to x=9, which is outside the grid since grids are typically from 0-7 or 1-8? Wait—probably coordinates go from 0-7 for each direction, making (8,5) invalid. Maybe I should assume that in this context, the grid goes up to at least 8.

Wait no—the grid must be such that moving right beyond x=8 is impossible if it's an 8x8 grid with indices from 1 to 8? Or maybe it's a zero-based index?

Assuming each cell can go up to 7 in either direction, so (8,5) would actually be out of bounds.

Wait the initial head position given is at (8,5), but perhaps that's an error. Maybe the grid goes from 0-7 for both x and y coordinates.

In that case, moving RIGHT from (7,y) would take it to (8,y), which isn't allowed—snake can't be outside the grid.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the starting position.

Given this confusion, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Maybe the snake is at x=0, y=5? Or any other coordinate system?

Wait—the initial positions are head (8,5) and body parts at 7,6; wait no—no: the body parts are given as list [(x,y)].

So with head at 8,5 and body at [ (7,6), (0,5) ].

Ah, so it's an 8x8 grid where x can be from 0 to 7 and y same. So position is (x,y).

Thus, moving RIGHT from x=7 would take it out of the grid—so it must have already been at x=0.

Wait no—if head is at 8,5, which is beyond 7 in some coordinate system. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the snake is at (x,y) coordinates where moving LEFT from x=1 would wrap around to 7—no—that complicates things further.

Perhaps instead of getting stuck on grid boundaries and indices, focus solely on the movement without worrying about edges for now. 

So back to initial problem: head at 8,5 with body parts at (7,6) and (0,5). So it's moving in some direction—wait no, given the list [(x,y)], perhaps each subsequent x is one less than previous.

Wait looking again:

Body parts are given as a list: [ (7,6), (0,5) ]

So from head to first body part, x decreases by 1; y decreases by 0. So it's moving in the direction of LEFT and UP? Or maybe that represents a snake moving in a specific pattern.

But perhaps this is not necessary for solving the problem—maybe I can model the movement regardless of how the snake is oriented initially.

Alternatively, since each body part follows directly behind another, the next head position must be one step ahead of the current head direction.

Wait but maybe that's complicating it further. 

Perhaps the key here is to figure out whether moving straight left for all steps would allow the snake to reach x=1 without collision and then move up towards y=8. Or if there are obstacles or self-collisions along this path, making a different route necessary.

So after first LEFT step: head at (7,5), body at [ (8,4) ]

Then moving UP:

Head becomes (7,6). Current S is [7,6; 7,5], then remove last element since it's not an apple move. So snake now has two segments: head and previous head.

But I'm getting confused again—it might be better to model this as a list where each movement shifts the entire body.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way—like using BFS or something—to compute the shortest path without self-collisions, but that seems complex for an initial analysis.

Given all these uncertainties, maybe it's best to outline the possible steps:

1. The snake is at (8,5) with a tail at (0,5).

2. To get towards x=1 and y=8, perhaps moving LEFT several times would bring head closer to x=1, then move UP.

But need to ensure that during this process, each new head position doesn't collide with any body part behind it.

So let's try a step-by-step simulation:

Current position after first left movement: (7,5), body at [8,4]

Next move: UP

New head is (7,6). Body becomes [7,5; 8,4] → After inserting into front and removing last element, it would be [7,6; 7,5].

Check for collisions:

Current head position (7,6) must not have any body parts in the previous positions.

Looking at the body: [(7,5), ... no other body parts except for that one. So safe to move up.

Now snake is at (7,6); body [7,5]

Next move: UP again

New head would be (7,7)

Insert old_head into front of body → [ (7,7), 7,6 ]

Then remove last element because not eating apple; so new S is [7,7].

Wait no—this seems off. Let's try:

After moving up from 7,6 to 7,7.

Current snake before movement: head at 7,6 and body at [7,5]

So step a: insert old_head (7,6) into front of body → new_S is [(7,7), (7,6)]

Step b: since not eating apple case, remove last element. So S becomes just [(7,7)]

But that's only one segment—head at 7,7.

Wait no—that can't be right because the snake needs to have multiple body parts.

I think I'm messing up the model here—it might help if we consider each movement adds a new head and removes the tail except when eating apple. So perhaps in this case, moving UP would cause the tail (which was at 7,5) to drop off after step b.

But since it's not an apple move, the snake will lose its last body part.

So from [(7,6)] → inserting new_head (7,7), then step a: [ (7,7), 7,6 ]

Step b: remove tail → S becomes [ (7,7) ]

Which would mean the snake has only one segment—head at (7,7). That seems impossible because snakes have multiple segments. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait maybe the movement works differently when the snake's length decreases due to a move that doesn't eat apple—it just shortens by one.

So after moving UP from 7,6 → new head is 7,7; body was [7,5], so now S becomes:

Insert into front: [(7,7), (7,6)] 

Then step b: since not eating apple, remove tail. So S is [(7,7)]

So the snake's body has collapsed to a single segment—only head at 7,7.

But that would make it impossible for the snake to move again because there are no body parts behind.

This suggests an error in my understanding of how the movement works when not eating apple. Perhaps moving UP without eating causes the tail to drop, making the snake one cell longer? Or perhaps shorter?

Alternatively, maybe when you don't eat, you only shift forward and lose the last segment—so from two segments to one.

So after the first left move: 7,5; body [8,4] → wait no—that's unclear.

Perhaps instead of trying to model each step manually, it's better to approach this problem differently. Maybe using a grid and attempting to navigate towards (1,8) while avoiding self-collisions is possible with certain turns and directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can make U-turns or other maneuvers to get around.

But given the complexity of calculating each move step-by-step manually, maybe I should look for another approach—like using graph theory where each node represents a snake's position and orientation, but that might be beyond this problem's scope.

Given time constraints, perhaps it's acceptable to outline a high-level strategy:

1. Move left as much as possible without hitting the grid boundary or own body.
2. Once at x=0 (if allowed), turn up towards y=8.
3. Adjust path if necessary due to self-collisions.

But in this case, starting position is (8,5). If it's an 8x8 grid with coordinates from 1-8, moving left until x=1 would require seven steps:

From 8→7→6→...→2→1. So that's six moves to get to x=1.

Then turning up to y=8: which is a difference of three (from 5 to 8) but since each move can only change one coordinate per step, it would take 3 more steps.

But total steps would be nine—assuming no self-collisions along the way. But whether that's possible depends on snake's body after moving left multiple times.

Alternatively, perhaps a combination of LEFT and UP moves is needed to navigate around any potential collisions, but without knowing exact grid layout or precise movement mechanics beyond the initial step, it's hard to say definitively.

In conclusion, while it might take several steps for the snake to reach (1,8), it seems feasible if it navigates towards x=1 and then turns up towards y=8. However, due to potential self-collisions as it tightens its position, a more strategic path may be required, possibly involving some right moves or other directional changes.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple by moving left until reaching (1,5) and then moving up three times.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The snake starts at (8,5), with body parts at (7,6) and (0,5).
2. It moves LEFT to (7,5). Now its body is [(8,4)].
3. Moves UP to (7,6); body becomes [ (7,5) ] after removing the tail.
4. Repeats moving UP until reaching y=8 at (1,8).

Answer: The snake can eat the apple by moving left twice and then up three times.

$\boxed{\text{Yes}}$
