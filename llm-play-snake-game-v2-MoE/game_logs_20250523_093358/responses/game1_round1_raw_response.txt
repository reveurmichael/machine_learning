========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll help you plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple at (7,6) from its current position at (5,5). Let's analyze the situation:

### Current State:
- Head position: (5, 5)
- Current direction: NONE (any move is allowed)
- Body cells: [] (no body yet)
- Apple position: (7, 6)

### Objective:
We need to get from (5,5) to (7,6). This requires:
1. Moving 2 units right (to match x-coordinate: 5 → 7)
2. Moving 1 unit up (to match y-coordinate: 5 → 6)

Since the snake can start in any direction and there are no body collisions to worry about yet, we'll prioritize a direct path.

### Path Planning:
A direct approach would be:
- RIGHT, RIGHT, UP

This sequence will take us directly from (5,5) to (7,6) without any detours or risks of collision since the snake's body is empty.

Let's put this into JSON format:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Direct path with no collisions or reversals needed."
}
```

### Final Check:
- Number of RIGHT moves - LEFT moves = 2 (7 - 5)
- Number of UP moves - DOWN moves = 1 (6 - 5)

Everything matches the constraints. So here is our final JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Direct path with no collisions or reversals needed."
}
```
