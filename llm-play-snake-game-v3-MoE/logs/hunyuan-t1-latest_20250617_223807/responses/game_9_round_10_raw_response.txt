========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 4 right and 2 up to reach the apple at (9,4). Starting from (5,2) with direction DOWN, the first safe move is RIGHT to (6,2). Subsequent moves UP to (6,3), RIGHT to (7,3), UP to (7,4), and RIGHT to (8,4) navigate toward the apple while avoiding body collisions. Finally, RIGHT to (9,4) reaches the apple. After eating, the snake can move UP or DOWN, ensuring no immediate trap."
