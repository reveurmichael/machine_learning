========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (1,7) with direction LEFT. To reach the apple at (2,5), the snake needs to move down twice and right once. First, moving DOWN to (1,6) avoids body collisions. Next, moving RIGHT to (2,6) is safe as the body hasn't shifted into that position yet. Finally, moving DOWN to (2,5) reaches the apple. Each move is valid (no direction reversal, no collisions), and after eating, there are safe next moves."
