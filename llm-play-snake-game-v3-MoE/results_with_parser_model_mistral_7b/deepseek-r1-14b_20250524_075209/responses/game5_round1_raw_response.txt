========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (8,3). Let's see. The head is currently at (5,5), and the body cells are empty, which means the snake is just the head right now—length 1.

First, I need to plan a path that moves the head towards the apple without causing any collisions or getting trapped. The apple is located at (8,3). So from (5,5), I need to move right three times because 8-5=3 and down two times because 5-3=2.

But wait, the direction can't be NONE anymore after the first move. Since the current direction is NONE, the first move can be any direction except reverse of NONE, which doesn't apply here.

Let me think about the path. The apple is to the right and down from the head. So moving right would make sense initially. But I should also check if there are any body parts in the way or future positions that might block the path after each move.

Since the body is empty, it's straightforward for the first few moves. Let me outline a possible sequence:

1. Move RIGHT: (5,5) → (6,5)
2. Move RIGHT again: (6,5) → (7,5)
3. Move RIGHT once more: (7,5) → (8,5)
4. Now, from (8,5), I need to move DOWN twice to reach (8,3). So next moves would be:
   - DOWN: (8,5) → (8,4)
   - DOWN: (8,4) → (8,3)

So the sequence would be RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN.

But wait, let's check if this path is safe and doesn't cause any collisions. Since the snake starts with length 1, moving right three times and then down two times won't have any body segments in the way because each move only adds a new head and removes the tail unless it eats an apple.

When moving to (8,5), the next move is DOWN to (8,4). Then another DOWN to (8,3) where the apple is. So yes, that should work.

I think this path is safe. Each step moves closer without reversing direction or causing any collisions.
