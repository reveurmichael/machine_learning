00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,150
see which shapes are the most
aerodynamic. If you guys didn't know,

8
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
aerodynamic. If you guys didn't know,

not only are we going to build five

36
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
not only are we going to build five
 

37
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,270
not only are we going to build five
custom cars with different shapes to

custom cars with different shapes to
 

39
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,870
custom cars with different shapes to
test their effectiveness, but we're also

40
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
test their effectiveness, but we're also
 

41
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,549
test their effectiveness, but we're also
going to put 10 LEGO car sets to the

00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
going to put 10 LEGO car sets to the
 

43
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,990
going to put 10 LEGO car sets to the
test to see if LEGO puts any thought

44
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
test to see if LEGO puts any thought
 

45
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,590
test to see if LEGO puts any thought
into aerodynamics at all or if they're

46
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
into aerodynamics at all or if they're
 

47
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,869
into aerodynamics at all or if they're
just built for looks. To start, we're

48
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
just built for looks. To start, we're
 

49
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,389
just built for looks. To start, we're
going to need a way to visually see air

50
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
going to need a way to visually see air
 

51
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,750
going to need a way to visually see air
moving around our vehicles so we can

52
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
moving around our vehicles so we can
 

53
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,430
moving around our vehicles so we can
rate them effectively. usher in the wind

54
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
rate them effectively. usher in the wind

00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
tunnel. Invented in 1871 by Frank Wenim,
 

57
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,590
tunnel. Invented in 1871 by Frank Wenim,
the wind tunnel was an enclosed box that

58
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
the wind tunnel was an enclosed box that
 

59
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,110
the wind tunnel was an enclosed box that
allowed high pressure air to flow

60
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
allowed high pressure air to flow
 

61
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,549
allowed high pressure air to flow
through from one end to the other,

62
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
through from one end to the other,
 

63
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,229
through from one end to the other,
allowing researchers to finally see the

64
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
allowing researchers to finally see the
 

65
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,310
allowing researchers to finally see the
aerodynamics of their vehicles without

66
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
aerodynamics of their vehicles without
 

67
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,310
aerodynamics of their vehicles without
testing. And with the added benefit of

68
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
testing. And with the added benefit of
 

69
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,069
testing. And with the added benefit of
modern technology, we can include a fog

70
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
modern technology, we can include a fog
 

71
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,349
modern technology, we can include a fog
machine in ours so we can actually see

72
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
machine in ours so we can actually see
 

73
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,670
machine in ours so we can actually see
the air

74
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:02,680
the air
 

75
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,509
the air
flow. I hope that doesn't trigger the

76
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
flow. I hope that doesn't trigger the
 

77
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,429
flow. I hope that doesn't trigger the
Uh-oh. So, the first step is to lay out

78
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
Uh-oh. So, the first step is to lay out
 

79
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,310
Uh-oh. So, the first step is to lay out
a base using 16x6 plates. I'm going to

80
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
a base using 16x6 plates. I'm going to
 

81
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,910
a base using 16x6 plates. I'm going to
create some angled walls using these

82
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:11,920
create some angled walls using these
 

83
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,590
create some angled walls using these
little techni pieces. So, let's create a

84
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
little techni pieces. So, let's create a
 

85
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,789
little techni pieces. So, let's create a
bunch of these braces and put them all

86
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
bunch of these braces and put them all
 

87
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,990
bunch of these braces and put them all
the way around the

88
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,000
the way around the
 

89
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,950
the way around the
plates. Then, we'll just lay down a

90
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
plates. Then, we'll just lay down a
 

91
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,550
plates. Then, we'll just lay down a
bunch of Technic bricks on the bottom to

92
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
bunch of Technic bricks on the bottom to
 

93
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,789
bunch of Technic bricks on the bottom to
hold this together so it's not floppy.

94
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
hold this together so it's not floppy.
 

95
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,390
hold this together so it's not floppy.
And boom. This thing should be pretty

96
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
And boom. This thing should be pretty
 

97
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,149
And boom. This thing should be pretty
sturdy. Look at that. Can you see our

98
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
sturdy. Look at that. Can you see our
 

99
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,469
sturdy. Look at that. Can you see our
wind tunnel yet? This is going to be so

100
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
wind tunnel yet? This is going to be so
 

101
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,070
wind tunnel yet? This is going to be so
cool. And now we just got to add a ton

102
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
cool. And now we just got to add a ton
 

103
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,670
cool. And now we just got to add a ton
of these little blue pins to lock

104
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
of these little blue pins to lock
 

105
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,109
of these little blue pins to lock
together all those Technic bricks. And

106
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
together all those Technic bricks. And
 

107
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,030
together all those Technic bricks. And
we'll finish up the top part of the

108
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,040

 

109
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,550

frame. Ah, running out of blue pins.

110
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560

 

111
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,710

There we go. Now we got to build up some

112
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
There we go. Now we got to build up some
 

113
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,230
There we go. Now we got to build up some
vertical pillars that come up from here

114
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
vertical pillars that come up from here
 

115
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,870
vertical pillars that come up from here
about this

116
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:55,880

 

117
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,749

high. There's just one more thing I'm

118
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
high. There's just one more thing I'm
 

119
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,389
high. There's just one more thing I'm
adding to the frame of this and that's

120
00:01:59,389 --> 00:01:59,399
adding to the frame of this and that's
 

121
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,389
adding to the frame of this and that's
because it does that which is not ideal

122
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
because it does that which is not ideal
 

123
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,749
because it does that which is not ideal
when you know we need this to be

124
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
when you know we need this to be
 

125
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,109
when you know we need this to be
structurally sound. Simple way to fix

126
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
structurally sound. Simple way to fix
 

127
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,870
structurally sound. Simple way to fix
this is just to introduce some triangle

128
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
this is just to introduce some triangle
 

129
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,630
this is just to introduce some triangle
shapes. So, I'm adding a few of these

130
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
shapes. So, I'm adding a few of these
 

131
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,469
shapes. So, I'm adding a few of these
lift arms in here to kind of cross over

132
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
lift arms in here to kind of cross over
 

133
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,229
lift arms in here to kind of cross over
and connect. And once we do that, you

134
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
and connect. And once we do that, you
 

135
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,990
and connect. And once we do that, you
can see just how sturdy this side

136
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
can see just how sturdy this side
 

137
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,910
can see just how sturdy this side
already

138
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:14,920
already
 

139
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,869
already
is. Now that we've got the frame for

140
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
is. Now that we've got the frame for
 

141
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,390
is. Now that we've got the frame for
this thing built up, the next step is to

142
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
this thing built up, the next step is to
 

143
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,750
this thing built up, the next step is to
build a really strong fan so we can

144
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
build a really strong fan so we can
 

145
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,110
build a really strong fan so we can
actually push air through our wind

146
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
actually push air through our wind
 

147
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,309
actually push air through our wind
tunnel. And for that, we're going to use

148
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
tunnel. And for that, we're going to use
 

149
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,470
tunnel. And for that, we're going to use
these Lego fan blade pieces. And we just

150
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
these Lego fan blade pieces. And we just
 

151
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,910
these Lego fan blade pieces. And we just
got to arrange these in a fan shape. I'm

152
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
got to arrange these in a fan shape. I'm
 

153
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,510
got to arrange these in a fan shape. I'm
going to snap on two of these Technic

154
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
going to snap on two of these Technic
 

155
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,869
going to snap on two of these Technic
pieces. And if we connect a few of these

156
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
pieces. And if we connect a few of these
 

157
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,070
pieces. And if we connect a few of these
little pieces, we should be able to snap

158
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
little pieces, we should be able to snap
 

159
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,390
little pieces, we should be able to snap
on our

160
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:31,400
on our
 

161
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,630
on our
propellers. Look at that.

162
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
propellers. Look at that.
 

163
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,750
propellers. Look at that.
We're going to need to connect a few

164
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
We're going to need to connect a few
 

165
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,270
We're going to need to connect a few
motors together so that we'll have

166
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
motors together so that we'll have
 

167
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,710
motors together so that we'll have
enough power to actually spin this

168
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
enough power to actually spin this
 

169
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,070
enough power to actually spin this
really fast. And to make this thing spin

170
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
really fast. And to make this thing spin
 

171
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,190
really fast. And to make this thing spin
as fast as possible, we're going to

172
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
as fast as possible, we're going to
 

173
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,869
as fast as possible, we're going to
implement what's called a gear ratio,

174
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
implement what's called a gear ratio,
 

175
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,309
implement what's called a gear ratio,
which essentially means if we connect a

176
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
which essentially means if we connect a
 

177
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,070
which essentially means if we connect a
smaller and larger gear together like

178
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
smaller and larger gear together like
 

179
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,750
smaller and larger gear together like
this, and we drive the larger gear, the

180
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
this, and we drive the larger gear, the
 

181
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,949
this, and we drive the larger gear, the
small one is going to rotate a lot

182
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:49,959
small one is going to rotate a lot
 

183
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,910
small one is going to rotate a lot
faster. So, it should give us the speed

184
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
faster. So, it should give us the speed
 

185
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,190
faster. So, it should give us the speed
we need. So, let's connect these guys

186
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
we need. So, let's connect these guys
 

187
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,790
we need. So, let's connect these guys
together and attach some large gears to

188
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
together and attach some large gears to
 

189
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,990
together and attach some large gears to
them. And then we'll stick our small

190
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
them. And then we'll stick our small
 

191
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,070
them. And then we'll stick our small
gear right here through the center.

192
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
gear right here through the center.
 

193

That's why we have eye protection. We

need to lock all of these pieces
 

203
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,670
need to lock all of these pieces

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,070
now that is breezy, dude. Oh gosh. Well,
that's the suction. Wow, that's actually

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
that's the suction. Wow, that's actually
 

213
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,910
that's the suction. Wow, that's actually
impressive. You can see we can put our

impressive. You can see we can put our
 

215
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,229

00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
fan on one side and that'll blow air
 

217
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,509
fan on one side and that'll blow air
through this way. So, we basically just

00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
through this way. So, we basically just
 

219
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,790
through this way. So, we basically just
need to cover all these walls with

need to cover all these walls with
 

221
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,070
need to cover all these walls with

right here with a bunch of bricks so I

right here with a bunch of bricks so I
 

241
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,229
right here with a bunch of bricks so I
can get it level with this lip

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,550
can get it level with this lip

So, we essentially just need to figure

246
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
So, we essentially just need to figure
 

247
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,750
So, we essentially just need to figure
out a way to mount this in here behind

248
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
out a way to mount this in here behind
 

249
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,589
out a way to mount this in here behind
some sort of wall so you can't see it. I

250
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
some sort of wall so you can't see it. I
 

251
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,350
some sort of wall so you can't see it. I
think the best way to do that is just to

252
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
think the best way to do that is just to
 

253
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,030
think the best way to do that is just to
take our Technic connections we have on

254
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
take our Technic connections we have on
 

255
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,390
take our Technic connections we have on
these motors and try and build something

256
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
these motors and try and build something
 

257
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,830
these motors and try and build something
that goes across and attaches to these

258
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
that goes across and attaches to these
 

259
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,030
that goes across and attaches to these
Technic bricks in here. Connect a few of

260
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,040
Technic bricks in here. Connect a few of
 

261
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,710
Technic bricks in here. Connect a few of
these. Then we can put this guy right

262
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
these. Then we can put this guy right
 

263
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,589
these. Then we can put this guy right
there. This guy here. Let's see if this

264
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:14,599
there. This guy here. Let's see if this
 

265
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,469
there. This guy here. Let's see if this
works. I just got to add a little bit of

00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
works. I just got to add a little bit of

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,990
sturdied up, we need to add the fog
mechanism that's going to go on this

awesome because all you have to do is
 

283
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,670
awesome because all you have to do is
push one button and it makes fog. Except

284
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
push one button and it makes fog. Except
 

285
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,590
push one button and it makes fog. Except
we want little pin points of fog so we

286
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
we want little pin points of fog so we
 

287
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,350
we want little pin points of fog so we
can actually see layers of air. So my

288
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
can actually see layers of air. So my
 

289
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,870
can actually see layers of air. So my
plan is to take a few of these pneumatic

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
plan is to take a few of these pneumatic
 

291
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,629
plan is to take a few of these pneumatic
tubes that LEGO makes and glue them into

292
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
tubes that LEGO makes and glue them into
 

293
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,150
tubes that LEGO makes and glue them into
this little end piece here so it'll

294
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
this little end piece here so it'll
 

295
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,390
this little end piece here so it'll
force the fog through

296
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:43,400

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
little inlets, which means we can attach
 

321
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,629
little inlets, which means we can attach
our pneumatics. And then we take this

322
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
our pneumatics. And then we take this
 

323
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,230
our pneumatics. And then we take this
Lego tire that's supposed to fit but

324
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
Lego tire that's supposed to fit but
 

325
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,390
Lego tire that's supposed to fit but
doesn't, and put it just on the end.

326
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
doesn't, and put it just on the end.
 

327
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,790
doesn't, and put it just on the end.
Stick this on the top of this. And boom.

328
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
Stick this on the top of this. And boom.
 

329
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,350
Stick this on the top of this. And boom.
Look, it only comes out of there.

330
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
Look, it only comes out of there.
 

331
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,950
Look, it only comes out of there.
Just need a few more tubes for the top.

332
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
Just need a few more tubes for the top.
 

333
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,790
Just need a few more tubes for the top.
That thing should be

334
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:23,800

 

335
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,870

spewing. Perfect. Now they're all going.

336
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
spewing. Perfect. Now they're all going.
 

337
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,390
spewing. Perfect. Now they're all going.
That is exactly what we need. So, I'm

338
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
That is exactly what we need. So, I'm
 

339
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,590
That is exactly what we need. So, I'm
going to build the fog machine into a

340
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
going to build the fog machine into a
 

341
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,029
going to build the fog machine into a
rack that we can actually slide in and

342
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
rack that we can actually slide in and
 

343
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,310
rack that we can actually slide in and
out of the wind tunnel. And then on one

344
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
out of the wind tunnel. And then on one
 

345
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,670
out of the wind tunnel. And then on one
side of this rack, I'm going to build up

346
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
side of this rack, I'm going to build up
 

347
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,270
side of this rack, I'm going to build up
a wall using a bunch of these long

348
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
a wall using a bunch of these long
 

349
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,710
a wall using a bunch of these long
Technic bricks. And because they have

350
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
Technic bricks. And because they have
 

351
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,909
Technic bricks. And because they have
these little holes, it's actually going

352
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
these little holes, it's actually going
 

353
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,830
these little holes, it's actually going
to directionalize the air flow. And we

354
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
to directionalize the air flow. And we
 

355
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,189
to directionalize the air flow. And we
can take each of our little tubes and

356
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
can take each of our little tubes and
 

357
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,029
can take each of our little tubes and
put it in a specific hole to test

358
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
put it in a specific hole to test
 

359
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,790
put it in a specific hole to test
different things. Now, we can plug in

360
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
different things. Now, we can plug in
 

361
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,550
different things. Now, we can plug in
all our pneumatic tubes.

362
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560

 

363
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,909

All right, that's what we want. Now we

364
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
All right, that's what we want. Now we
 

365
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,870
All right, that's what we want. Now we
just got to mount this in here. This

366
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
just got to mount this in here. This
 

367
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,090
just got to mount this in here. This
part should be

368
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,100
part should be
 

369
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,590
part should be
[Music]

370
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:00,600
[Music]
 

371
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,950
[Music]
done. Now we can slide this guy in the

372
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
done. Now we can slide this guy in the
 

373
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,150
done. Now we can slide this guy in the
back here. And now we just got to

374
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
back here. And now we just got to
 

375
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,670
back here. And now we just got to
connect our little button to the outside

376
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
connect our little button to the outside
 

377
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,189
connect our little button to the outside
so we can access it. So to do that, I'm

378
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
so we can access it. So to do that, I'm
 

379
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,550
so we can access it. So to do that, I'm
just going to add a long axle that goes

380
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
just going to add a long axle that goes
 

381
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,590
just going to add a long axle that goes
through the wall. And that should press

382
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
through the wall. And that should press
 

383
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,430
through the wall. And that should press
the button. Perfect. So, now that we

384
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
the button. Perfect. So, now that we
 

385
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,189
the button. Perfect. So, now that we
have the fog machine installed and a way

386
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
have the fog machine installed and a way
 

387
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,950
have the fog machine installed and a way
to turn it on and off, we need to just

388
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
to turn it on and off, we need to just
 

389
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,309
to turn it on and off, we need to just
install one more mechanism to this

390
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
install one more mechanism to this
 

391
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,670
install one more mechanism to this
before it'll be fully functional. And

392
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
before it'll be fully functional. And
 

393
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,870
before it'll be fully functional. And
that mechanism is going to be this

394
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
that mechanism is going to be this
 

395
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,550
that mechanism is going to be this
little tiny food scale. My plan is to

396
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
little tiny food scale. My plan is to
 

397
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,230
little tiny food scale. My plan is to
put this on the inside underneath the

398
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
put this on the inside underneath the
 

399
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,590
put this on the inside underneath the
road. And since this one's actually

400
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
road. And since this one's actually
 

401
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,029
road. And since this one's actually
wireless, we'll be able to see how much

402
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
wireless, we'll be able to see how much
 

403
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,870
wireless, we'll be able to see how much
weight is being lifted off of the car by

404
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
weight is being lifted off of the car by
 

405
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,309
weight is being lifted off of the car by
installing this over here, and that'll

406
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
installing this over here, and that'll
 

407
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,749
installing this over here, and that'll
wire connect to the scale underneath the

408
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
wire connect to the scale underneath the
 

409
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,590
wire connect to the scale underneath the
road, which I've just simply built up

410
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
road, which I've just simply built up
 

411
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,590
road, which I've just simply built up
out of a few plates and technic pieces

412
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
out of a few plates and technic pieces
 

413
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,029
out of a few plates and technic pieces
on the bottom to make it strong. All we

414
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
on the bottom to make it strong. All we
 

415
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,309
on the bottom to make it strong. All we
got to do now is just finish the details

416
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
got to do now is just finish the details
 

417
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,749
got to do now is just finish the details
on the outside and build the glass

418
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
on the outside and build the glass
 

419
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,870
on the outside and build the glass
window that's going to go on the front

420
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
window that's going to go on the front
 

421
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,950
window that's going to go on the front
of

422
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:41,960

 

423
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,629

this. Look at that. So, now that we have

424
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
this. Look at that. So, now that we have
 

425
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,909
this. Look at that. So, now that we have
all the mechanics done, all we have to

426
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
all the mechanics done, all we have to
 

427
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,510
all the mechanics done, all we have to
do is just add some exterior details on

428
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
do is just add some exterior details on
 

429
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,870
do is just add some exterior details on
the outside and then some lights on the

430
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
the outside and then some lights on the
 

431
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,550
the outside and then some lights on the
inside to make it look really cool. We

432
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
inside to make it look really cool. We
 

433
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,309
inside to make it look really cool. We
can finally test it

434
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:57,319

 

435
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,909

out. After 10 hours of work, I finally

436
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
out. After 10 hours of work, I finally
 

437
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:06,950
out. After 10 hours of work, I finally
completed the Lego wind tunnel.

438
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960

 

439
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,309

You can see on this side we have the

440
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
You can see on this side we have the
 

441
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,830
You can see on this side we have the
giant fan which we can flick on with

442
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
giant fan which we can flick on with
 

443
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,749
giant fan which we can flick on with
this switch here and that will activate

444
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
this switch here and that will activate
 

445
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,110
this switch here and that will activate
our wind tunnel. And now that we got

446
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
our wind tunnel. And now that we got
 

447
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,390
our wind tunnel. And now that we got
this built up, we can finally test some

448
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
this built up, we can finally test some
 

449
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,830
this built up, we can finally test some
Lego

450
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:16,840

 

451
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,950

cars. As you see, we have quite a few

452
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
cars. As you see, we have quite a few
 

453
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,230
cars. As you see, we have quite a few
cars to test. Let's start with the

454
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
cars to test. Let's start with the
 

455
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,710
cars to test. Let's start with the
Ferrari F40. It's going to take me a

456
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
Ferrari F40. It's going to take me a
 

457
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,749
Ferrari F40. It's going to take me a
while to build all these, but this is

458
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
while to build all these, but this is
 

459
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,180
while to build all these, but this is
going to be

460
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,190
going to be
 

461
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,950
going to be
[Music]

462
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:25,960

fun. And there we have the Ferrari F40.

464
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
fun. And there we have the Ferrari F40.
 

465
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,870
fun. And there we have the Ferrari F40.
This thing is absolutely beautiful. Just

466
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
This thing is absolutely beautiful. Just
 

467
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,070
This thing is absolutely beautiful. Just
some of the connections on these cars

468
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
some of the connections on these cars
 

469
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,430
some of the connections on these cars
are really, really interesting. Let's

470
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
are really, really interesting. Let's
 

471
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,110
are really, really interesting. Let's
test this out and see how aerodynamic it

472
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
test this out and see how aerodynamic it
 

473
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,950
test this out and see how aerodynamic it
really is. All we got to do is push this

474
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
really is. All we got to do is push this
 

475
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,070
really is. All we got to do is push this
button and it should start kicking out

476
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,080
button and it should start kicking out
 

477
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,710
button and it should start kicking out
fog. Dude, look at that. That is so

478
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:43,720
fog. Dude, look at that. That is so
 

479
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,710
fog. Dude, look at that. That is so
sick. Wow. Yeah. Okay. The F40 is very

480
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
sick. Wow. Yeah. Okay. The F40 is very
 

481
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,390
sick. Wow. Yeah. Okay. The F40 is very
aerodynamic. You can even see it kind of

482
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
aerodynamic. You can even see it kind of
 

483
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,909
aerodynamic. You can even see it kind of
going through the rear wing there, which

484
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
going through the rear wing there, which
 

485
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,589
going through the rear wing there, which
is really cool. So, there's a few

486
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
is really cool. So, there's a few
 

487
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,189
is really cool. So, there's a few
different forces at work here. First, we

488
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
different forces at work here. First, we
 

489
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,869
different forces at work here. First, we
have drag. Drag is the force that's

490
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
have drag. Drag is the force that's
 

491
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,550
have drag. Drag is the force that's
acting in the opposite direction of our

492
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
acting in the opposite direction of our
 

493
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,070
acting in the opposite direction of our
object moving through the air. So, to

494
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
object moving through the air. So, to
 

495
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,670
object moving through the air. So, to
design a vehicle to move as fast as

496
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
design a vehicle to move as fast as
 

497
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,430
design a vehicle to move as fast as
possible, we want to decrease the drag

498
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
possible, we want to decrease the drag
 

499
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,029
possible, we want to decrease the drag
by getting the air to move out of the

500
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
by getting the air to move out of the
 

501
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,110
by getting the air to move out of the
way or over and around our vehicle as

502
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
way or over and around our vehicle as
 

503
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,029
way or over and around our vehicle as
easily as possible. There's also lift,

504
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
easily as possible. There's also lift,
 

505
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,230
easily as possible. There's also lift,
which is when the pressure underneath

506
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
which is when the pressure underneath
 

507
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,909
which is when the pressure underneath
the vehicle exceeds that of the pressure

508
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
the vehicle exceeds that of the pressure
 

509
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,670
the vehicle exceeds that of the pressure
on top of our vehicle, causing it to

510
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
on top of our vehicle, causing it to
 

511
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,189
on top of our vehicle, causing it to
flip. In order to test lift, we're going

512
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
flip. In order to test lift, we're going
 

513
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,790
flip. In order to test lift, we're going
to actually use a leaf blower and blow

514
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
to actually use a leaf blower and blow
 

515
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,070
to actually use a leaf blower and blow
it through this side. So, we can take

516
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
it through this side. So, we can take
 

517
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,990
it through this side. So, we can take
out our fog machine. We just have this

518
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
out our fog machine. We just have this
 

519
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,670
out our fog machine. We just have this
guy, which has two pins. These will

520
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
guy, which has two pins. These will
 

521
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,950
guy, which has two pins. These will
actually go right into those little

522
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
actually go right into those little
 

523
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,469
actually go right into those little
holes right there. And now, as you can

524
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
holes right there. And now, as you can
 

525
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,710
holes right there. And now, as you can
see, if we push this down, we have a

526
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
see, if we push this down, we have a
 

527
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,469
see, if we push this down, we have a
reading. For the lift test, it's a pass

528
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
reading. For the lift test, it's a pass
 

529
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,070
reading. For the lift test, it's a pass
fail. If the scale drops under its

530
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
fail. If the scale drops under its
 

531
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,589
fail. If the scale drops under its
original number, we know we're achieving

532
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
original number, we know we're achieving
 

533
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,189
original number, we know we're achieving
lift, and we don't want that. And if the

534
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
lift, and we don't want that. And if the
 

535
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,870
lift, and we don't want that. And if the
number on the scale increases, we know

536
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
number on the scale increases, we know
 

537
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,709
number on the scale increases, we know
we've achieved what's called downforce,

538
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
we've achieved what's called downforce,
 

539
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,389
we've achieved what's called downforce,
which is the byproduct of the air moving

540
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
which is the byproduct of the air moving
 

541
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,149
which is the byproduct of the air moving
over the vehicle, pushing it down to the

542
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
over the vehicle, pushing it down to the
 

543
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,750
over the vehicle, pushing it down to the
ground. We're getting about 10 points of

544
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
ground. We're getting about 10 points of
 

545
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,670
ground. We're getting about 10 points of
downforce on the scale, which is great.

546
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
downforce on the scale, which is great.
 

547
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,430
downforce on the scale, which is great.
I'd give this one a 10 out of 10, but

right there. If we turn the fan off,
 

623
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,389
right there. If we turn the fan off,
what happens? Does it just completely

624
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
what happens? Does it just completely
 

625
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,750
what happens? Does it just completely
fog up? Turn it back on.

one.

636
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:28,600
one.
 

637
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,949
one.
Uh-oh. It went down by like at least 10

638
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
Uh-oh. It went down by like at least 10
 

639
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,790
Uh-oh. It went down by like at least 10
points. Unfortunately, I got to say this

640
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
points. Unfortunately, I got to say this
 

641
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,630
points. Unfortunately, I got to say this
one fails the lift test. Next up, we

642
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
one fails the lift test. Next up, we
 

643
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,470
one fails the lift test. Next up, we
have the Nissan Skyline. It's got a

644
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
have the Nissan Skyline. It's got a
 

645
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,910
have the Nissan Skyline. It's got a
little wing on the back here. It's also

646
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
little wing on the back here. It's also
 

647
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,350
little wing on the back here. It's also
got a little air intake in the front.

648
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
got a little air intake in the front.
 

649
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,110
got a little air intake in the front.
However, the Lego air intake doesn't

650
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
However, the Lego air intake doesn't
 

651
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,710
However, the Lego air intake doesn't
actually have holes, so it might just

652
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
actually have holes, so it might just
 

653
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,310
actually have holes, so it might just
stop the car up. We start by filling it

654
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
stop the car up. We start by filling it
 

655
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,030
stop the car up. We start by filling it
with fog.

656
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,040
with fog.
 

657
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,190
with fog.
And boom. Look at the air just flowing

658
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
And boom. Look at the air just flowing
 

659
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,630
And boom. Look at the air just flowing
right over the top. So you can kind of

660
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
right over the top. So you can kind of
 

661
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,550
right over the top. So you can kind of
see how it's cutting through the fog

662
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
see how it's cutting through the fog
 

663
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,310
see how it's cutting through the fog
there. What if we angled the rear wing?

664
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
there. What if we angled the rear wing?
 

665
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,630
there. What if we angled the rear wing?
What will that

666
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:55,640
What will that
 

667
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,190
What will that
do? Wow. You know, for some reason, I

668
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
do? Wow. You know, for some reason, I
 

669
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,030
do? Wow. You know, for some reason, I
want to give the Skyline a 10 out of 10

670
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
want to give the Skyline a 10 out of 10
 

671
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,710
want to give the Skyline a 10 out of 10
for the aerodynamic test. Let's see how

672
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
for the aerodynamic test. Let's see how
 

673
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,650
for the aerodynamic test. Let's see how
this one

674
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:03,660
this one
 

675
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,509
this one
[Applause]

676
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,519

 

677
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,030

does. Our Skyline does not pass the lift

678
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
does. Our Skyline does not pass the lift
 

679
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,550
does. Our Skyline does not pass the lift
test. I don't know. It just it really

680
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
test. I don't know. It just it really
 

681
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,110
test. I don't know. It just it really
wanted to go. Next up, we got our F1

682
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
wanted to go. Next up, we got our F1
 

683
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,550
wanted to go. Next up, we got our F1
car. I'm going to put our little ooot

684
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
car. I'm going to put our little ooot
 

685
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,190
car. I'm going to put our little ooot
crash test dummy in

686
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,200
crash test dummy in
 

687
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,790
crash test dummy in
here. Here we go. Push our little button

688
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
here. Here we go. Push our little button
 

689
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,790
here. Here we go. Push our little button
here. Like, this is working exactly how

690
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
here. Like, this is working exactly how
 

691
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,910
here. Like, this is working exactly how
it's supposed to. I'm going to turn it

692
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
it's supposed to. I'm going to turn it
 

693
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,750
it's supposed to. I'm going to turn it
up a little bit cuz, you know, F1 cars

694
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
up a little bit cuz, you know, F1 cars
 

695
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,350
up a little bit cuz, you know, F1 cars
are going a little bit faster than that.

696
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
are going a little bit faster than that.
 

697
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,710
are going a little bit faster than that.
You can definitely see the air going

698
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
You can definitely see the air going
 

699
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,710
You can definitely see the air going
around that rear wing and over it. So,

700
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
around that rear wing and over it. So,
 

701
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,910
around that rear wing and over it. So,
it's working good. And I also want to

702
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
it's working good. And I also want to
 

703
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,750
it's working good. And I also want to
mention the under tray on this car. It's

704
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
mention the under tray on this car. It's
 

705
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,269
mention the under tray on this car. It's
extremely welldesigned. So, you can see

706
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
extremely welldesigned. So, you can see
 

707
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,110
extremely welldesigned. So, you can see
here there's no space for that air

708
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
here there's no space for that air
 

709
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,069
here there's no space for that air
underneath, which is supposed to

710
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
underneath, which is supposed to
 

711
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,430
underneath, which is supposed to
increase the grip on the road. Looks

712
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
increase the grip on the road. Looks
 

713
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,150
increase the grip on the road. Looks
like we got 134 to start. Let's bump

714
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
like we got 134 to start. Let's bump
 

715
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,870
like we got 134 to start. Let's bump
this up slowly. Wow, that we're getting

716
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
this up slowly. Wow, that we're getting
 

717
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,230
this up slowly. Wow, that we're getting
a lot of downforce. 134, 150,

718
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,240

 

719
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,269

160. That's pretty good. We're getting

720
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
160. That's pretty good. We're getting
 

721
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,590
160. That's pretty good. We're getting
about 10 to 15 points of downforce. I

722
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
about 10 to 15 points of downforce. I
 

723
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,949
about 10 to 15 points of downforce. I
was expecting this one to kind of fly up

724
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
was expecting this one to kind of fly up
 

725
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,470
was expecting this one to kind of fly up
just because it's so thin, but this one

726
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
just because it's so thin, but this one
 

727
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,990
just because it's so thin, but this one
definitely passes. I'd give it a 9 out

728
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
definitely passes. I'd give it a 9 out
 

729
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,509
definitely passes. I'd give it a 9 out
of 10. Also, it's really beautifully

730
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
of 10. Also, it's really beautifully
 

731
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,430
of 10. Also, it's really beautifully
designed, so great job, LEGO. Next up,

732
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
designed, so great job, LEGO. Next up,
 

733
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,670
designed, so great job, LEGO. Next up,
we have the beautiful Ford Mustang. This

734
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
we have the beautiful Ford Mustang. This
 

735
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,269
we have the beautiful Ford Mustang. This
one I'm excited to see. It's not as

736
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
one I'm excited to see. It's not as
 

737
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,110
one I'm excited to see. It's not as
aerodynamic or like angular as the other

738
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
aerodynamic or like angular as the other
 

739
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,629
aerodynamic or like angular as the other
cars, but ooh, look at that. You can

740
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
cars, but ooh, look at that. You can
 

741
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,310
cars, but ooh, look at that. You can
totally see how the air is just going

742
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
totally see how the air is just going
 

743
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,069
totally see how the air is just going
right over the front of the hood and

744
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
right over the front of the hood and
 

745
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,750
right over the front of the hood and
then actually cutting underneath the

746
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
then actually cutting underneath the
 

747
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,430
then actually cutting underneath the
spoiler. The cool thing is if we control

748
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
spoiler. The cool thing is if we control
 

749
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,110
spoiler. The cool thing is if we control
our fan speed with this guy, we can

750
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
our fan speed with this guy, we can
 

751
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,190
our fan speed with this guy, we can
actually simulate by filling it with fog

752
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
actually simulate by filling it with fog
 

753
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,790
actually simulate by filling it with fog
our car accelerating. So there we are.

754
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
our car accelerating. So there we are.
 

755
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,829
our car accelerating. So there we are.
It stopped and now it accelerates and

756
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
It stopped and now it accelerates and
 

757
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,389
It stopped and now it accelerates and
that is the air moving around the car.

758
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
that is the air moving around the car.
 

759
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,509
that is the air moving around the car.
Oh, that is so

760
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:34,519

 

761
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,740

cool. Wow.

762
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:37,750
cool. Wow.
 

763
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,069
cool. Wow.
[Music]

764
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
[Music]
 

765
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,910
[Music]
We got about 179 at the highest there.

766
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
We got about 179 at the highest there.
 

767
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,509
We got about 179 at the highest there.
And no lift at all on this one. So, I'd

768
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
And no lift at all on this one. So, I'd
 

769
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,030
And no lift at all on this one. So, I'd
say the Ford Mustang performs really

770
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
say the Ford Mustang performs really
 

771
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,030
say the Ford Mustang performs really
well. I give it a 9 out of 10. Next up,

772
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
well. I give it a 9 out of 10. Next up,
 

773
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,670
well. I give it a 9 out of 10. Next up,
the Toyota Supra. A very popular car.

774
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
the Toyota Supra. A very popular car.
 

775
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,030
the Toyota Supra. A very popular car.
Here we go. Ooh. Yeah, look at that. You

776
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
Here we go. Ooh. Yeah, look at that. You
 

777
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,389
Here we go. Ooh. Yeah, look at that. You
can see it flying over the back of the

778
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
can see it flying over the back of the
 

779
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,750
can see it flying over the back of the
spoiler as well. So, I feel like this

780
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
spoiler as well. So, I feel like this
 

781
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,150
spoiler as well. So, I feel like this
one is shaped very aerodynamically. Also

782
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
one is shaped very aerodynamically. Also
 

783
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,509
one is shaped very aerodynamically. Also
want to mention, I don't see a whole lot

784
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
want to mention, I don't see a whole lot
 

785
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,350
want to mention, I don't see a whole lot
going underneath the vehicle and exiting

786
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
going underneath the vehicle and exiting
 

787
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,790
going underneath the vehicle and exiting
at the back. And if we pull this guy

788
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
at the back. And if we pull this guy
 

789
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,389
at the back. And if we pull this guy
out, you can see the under tray on this

790
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
out, you can see the under tray on this
 

791
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,069
out, you can see the under tray on this
car is super flat with this front. So,

792
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
car is super flat with this front. So,
 

793
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,590
car is super flat with this front. So,
if we put this on a flat surface, you

794
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
if we put this on a flat surface, you
 

795
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,190
if we put this on a flat surface, you
barely have any clearance, which

796
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
barely have any clearance, which
 

797
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,389
barely have any clearance, which
probably isn't a good thing on bumpy

798
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
probably isn't a good thing on bumpy
 

799
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,470
probably isn't a good thing on bumpy
roads, but it's a Lego car. Let's do the

800
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
roads, but it's a Lego car. Let's do the
 

801
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,450
roads, but it's a Lego car. Let's do the
lift test on the

802
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:13,460
lift test on the

Supra. Yeah, there we

806
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,120

 

807
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,230

go. Go down. Toyota Supra passes. The

808
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
go. Go down. Toyota Supra passes. The
 

809
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,670
go. Go down. Toyota Supra passes. The
next car up we have is the Kennes Jes.

810
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
next car up we have is the Kennes Jes.
 

811
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,910
next car up we have is the Kennes Jes.
This thing is so cool. Yeah. I just I'm

812
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
This thing is so cool. Yeah. I just I'm
 

813
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,350
This thing is so cool. Yeah. I just I'm
so excited loading each one of these in

814
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
so excited loading each one of these in
 

815
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,550
so excited loading each one of these in
here cuz I want to see how well it's

816
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
here cuz I want to see how well it's
 

817
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,710
here cuz I want to see how well it's
going to

818
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:33,720
going to
 

819
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,550
going to
do. Hey, that's pretty aerodynamic. Ooh,

820
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
do. Hey, that's pretty aerodynamic. Ooh,
 

821
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,150
do. Hey, that's pretty aerodynamic. Ooh,
and check out that rear wing. You can

822
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
and check out that rear wing. You can
 

823
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,829
and check out that rear wing. You can
totally see the air moving back

824
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:40,839
totally see the air moving back
 

825
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,190
totally see the air moving back
there. It seems like at the front the

826
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,200
there. It seems like at the front the
 

827
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,110
there. It seems like at the front the
bumper is kind of trapping a bit of that

828
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
bumper is kind of trapping a bit of that
 

829
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,590
bumper is kind of trapping a bit of that
air. If we bring up the speed, I wonder

830
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
air. If we bring up the speed, I wonder
 

831
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,829
air. If we bring up the speed, I wonder
if that'll get

832
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:48,839
if that'll get
 

833
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,269
if that'll get
better. Not really. It is going over the

834
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
better. Not really. It is going over the
 

835
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,670
better. Not really. It is going over the
top, which is what we want. That is

836
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
top, which is what we want. That is
 

837
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,949
top, which is what we want. That is
really, really cool. We got 130. Slowly

838
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
really, really cool. We got 130. Slowly
 

839
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,150
really, really cool. We got 130. Slowly
bring this up.

840
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,160
bring this up.
 

841
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,910
bring this up.

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
wa. We just got about 65 points. That is
 

847
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,189
wa. We just got about 65 points. That is
some amazing downforce. So far, this is

848
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
some amazing downforce. So far, this is
 

849
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,949
some amazing downforce. So far, this is
the best performing Lego set for

850
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
the best performing Lego set for
 

851
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,550
the best performing Lego set for
downforce. I think it's because the air

852
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
downforce. I think it's because the air
 

853
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,990
downforce. I think it's because the air
was getting caught in this little piece

854
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
was getting caught in this little piece
 

855
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,430
was getting caught in this little piece
right here, which is like the little air

856
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
right here, which is like the little air
 

857
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,949
right here, which is like the little air
intake on the front and it was just

858
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
intake on the front and it was just
 

859
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,470
intake on the front and it was just
pushing it down. Wow, that is really

860
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
pushing it down. Wow, that is really
 

861
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,389
pushing it down. Wow, that is really
good. That definitely passes. This is

862
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
good. That definitely passes. This is
 

863
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,870
good. That definitely passes. This is
the Lamborghini V12 Vision. It is

864
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
the Lamborghini V12 Vision. It is
 

865
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,110
the Lamborghini V12 Vision. It is
absolutely beautiful. I'm genuinely

866
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
absolutely beautiful. I'm genuinely
 

867
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,949
absolutely beautiful. I'm genuinely
curious to see how all these angles and

868
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
curious to see how all these angles and
 

869
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,790
curious to see how all these angles and
curves will do against wind. So, we're

870
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
curves will do against wind. So, we're
 

871
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,230
curves will do against wind. So, we're
going to fill the room with fog and then

872
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
going to fill the room with fog and then
 

873
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,990
going to fill the room with fog and then
we're going to simulate a acceleration.

874
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
we're going to simulate a acceleration.
 

875
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,590
we're going to simulate a acceleration.
Here we go. Turn the fan on and boom.

876
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
Here we go. Turn the fan on and boom.
 

877
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,350
Here we go. Turn the fan on and boom.
This is one of the most aerodynamic cars

This is one of the most aerodynamic cars
 

879
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,790
This is one of the most aerodynamic cars
I think we've seen. It's really hard to

880
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
I think we've seen. It's really hard to
 

881
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,990
I think we've seen. It's really hard to
see from this angle, too, but it's

882
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
see from this angle, too, but it's
 

883
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,350
see from this angle, too, but it's
actually flowing through the hood of the

884
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
actually flowing through the hood of the
 

885
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,269
actually flowing through the hood of the
car because there's some holes in it.

886
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
car because there's some holes in it.
 

887
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,870
car because there's some holes in it.
That's sick. Yeah, this one's just

888
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
That's sick. Yeah, this one's just
 

889
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,110
That's sick. Yeah, this one's just
cutting through the air like butter.

890
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
cutting through the air like butter.
 

891
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,550
cutting through the air like butter.
Here we go.

892
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:51,560

really aerodynamic 10 out of 10 guys I
 

905
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,710
really aerodynamic 10 out of 10 guys I
just had an idea what if we built a wind

906
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
just had an idea what if we built a wind
 

907
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,710
just had an idea what if we built a wind
tunnel but for planes and we could

908
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
tunnel but for planes and we could
 

909
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,150
tunnel but for planes and we could
actually test the aerodynamics of like

910
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
actually test the aerodynamics of like

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,670
actually test the aerodynamics of like

jets and planes if you guys think that'd
 

913
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,189
jets and planes if you guys think that'd
be cool comment down below I'd have to

914
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
be cool comment down below I'd have to
 

915
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,790
be cool comment down below I'd have to
rebuild this and make a completely

916
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
rebuild this and make a completely
 

917
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,230
rebuild this and make a completely
different one but I think it'd be cool I

918
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
different one but I think it'd be cool I
 

919
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,269
different one but I think it'd be cool I
want to give a little bit of comparison

920
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
want to give a little bit of comparison
 

921
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,509
want to give a little bit of comparison
with this car so we have the Mercedes G

926
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
sloped hood. Will it work? It doesn't
 

927
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,310
sloped hood. Will it work? It doesn't
seem to be having a problem with it,

928
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
seem to be having a problem with it,
 

929
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,670
seem to be having a problem with it,
honestly. Look what's happening at the

930
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
honestly. Look what's happening at the
 

931
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,509
honestly. Look what's happening at the
very rear of the vehicle. The air is

932
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
very rear of the vehicle. The air is
 

933
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,790
very rear of the vehicle. The air is
kind of gathering there, and that's

934
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
kind of gathering there, and that's
 

935
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,550
kind of gathering there, and that's
creating what's called dirty air, which

936
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
creating what's called dirty air, which
 

937
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,590
creating what's called dirty air, which
is basically where the air gets

938
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
is basically where the air gets
 

939
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,350
is basically where the air gets
disrupted and moves around all funky

940
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
disrupted and moves around all funky
 

941
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,550
disrupted and moves around all funky
kind of like this. It's like creating

942
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
kind of like this. It's like creating
 

943
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,910
kind of like this. It's like creating
like little wavy patterns, and

944
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
like little wavy patterns, and
 

945
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,430
like little wavy patterns, and
apparently that's a lot harder to drive

946
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
apparently that's a lot harder to drive
 

947
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,629
apparently that's a lot harder to drive
through. I think this one might just

948
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
through. I think this one might just
 

949
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,110
through. I think this one might just
blow away back into the jet. Let's see.

950
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
blow away back into the jet. Let's see.
 

951
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,430
blow away back into the jet. Let's see.
Wa! 225. That's like the heaviest one so

952
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
Wa! 225. That's like the heaviest one so
 

953
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,590
Wa! 225. That's like the heaviest one so
far. Here we go. 230.

00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600

 

955
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,820

Not bad. Whoa, that's over 110

956
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:56,830
Not bad. Whoa, that's over 110

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,710

the best performing one still. Here we
 

963
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,870

Batmobile. I think the Batmobile is
 

967
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,030
Batmobile. I think the Batmobile is
going to go pretty well cuz it's

968
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
going to go pretty well cuz it's
 

969
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,590
going to go pretty well cuz it's
designed to go fast to stop grime. Let's

970
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
designed to go fast to stop grime. Let's
 

971
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,389
designed to go fast to stop grime. Let's
start with the acceleration test. Ooh,

972
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
start with the acceleration test. Ooh,
 

973
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,230
start with the acceleration test. Ooh,
there we go.

974
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
there we go.
 

975
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,910
there we go.
Wow, this is kind of weird. I'm not

Wow, this is kind of weird. I'm not
 

977
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,350
Wow, this is kind of weird. I'm not
sure. This one just looks a lot

978
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
sure. This one just looks a lot
 

979
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,189
sure. This one just looks a lot
different than the others. It's like the

980
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
different than the others. It's like the
 

981
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,870
different than the others. It's like the
air is flowing around it quite a bit

982
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
air is flowing around it quite a bit
 

983
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,389
air is flowing around it quite a bit
differently, which is strange. I can see

984
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
differently, which is strange. I can see
 

985
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,230
differently, which is strange. I can see
that the back two wings are cutting

986
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
that the back two wings are cutting
 

987
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,749
that the back two wings are cutting
through the fog, which is kind of cool,

988
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
through the fog, which is kind of cool,
 

989
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,470

of downforce on this one. So, the
 

1001
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,550

Batmobile definitely passes the lift
 

1003

It's like a visual that you can just

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
It's like a visual that you can just
 

1023
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,870
It's like a visual that you can just
tell it's cutting through the air better

1024
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
tell it's cutting through the air better
 

1025
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,390
tell it's cutting through the air better
than other cars. You can see the front

wing on this one is really designed
 

1029
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,590
wing on this one is really designed
well, cuz it is cutting through the air

1030
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
well, cuz it is cutting through the air
 

1031
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,390
well, cuz it is cutting through the air
quite nicely. Straight across

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:29,640

 

1039
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,070

120. I find it really cool that even if

1040
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
120. I find it really cool that even if
 

1041
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,070
120. I find it really cool that even if
I blow it right underneath the car, it's

1042
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
I blow it right underneath the car, it's
 

1043
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,830
I blow it right underneath the car, it's
still designed so well that it doesn't

1044
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
still designed so well that it doesn't
 

1045
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,669
still designed so well that it doesn't
achieve lift. I definitely give this car

1046
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
achieve lift. I definitely give this car
 

1047
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,590
achieve lift. I definitely give this car
a 10 out of 10. So, it turns out LEGO

1048
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
a 10 out of 10. So, it turns out LEGO
 

1049
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,110
a 10 out of 10. So, it turns out LEGO
does design their cars to be somewhat

1050
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
does design their cars to be somewhat
 

1051
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,789
does design their cars to be somewhat
aerodynamic. They all seem to utilize

1052
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
aerodynamic. They all seem to utilize
 

1053
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,549
aerodynamic. They all seem to utilize
different common shapes like triangles

1054
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
different common shapes like triangles
 

1055
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,150
different common shapes like triangles
and wedges combined together in

1056
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
and wedges combined together in
 

1057
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,669
and wedges combined together in
different angles to make them fast and

1058
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
different angles to make them fast and
 

1059
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,750
different angles to make them fast and
reduce the drag on the vehicles. So, I'm

1060
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
reduce the drag on the vehicles. So, I'm
 

1061
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,950
reduce the drag on the vehicles. So, I'm
going to take those individual shapes

1062
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
going to take those individual shapes
 

1063
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,710
going to take those individual shapes
and see if we can turn those into cars

1064
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
and see if we can turn those into cars
 

1065
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,390
and see if we can turn those into cars
themselves just to see which ones will

1066
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
themselves just to see which ones will
 

1067
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,990
themselves just to see which ones will
perform the best. For this first custom

1068
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
perform the best. For this first custom
 

1069
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,990
perform the best. For this first custom
car, let's just build a triangle and add

1070
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
car, let's just build a triangle and add
 

1071
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,590
car, let's just build a triangle and add
some wheels to it. This is like the

1072
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
some wheels to it. This is like the
 

1073
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,430
some wheels to it. This is like the
cheese wedge of cars. Then, what if we

1074
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
cheese wedge of cars. Then, what if we
 

1075
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,350
cheese wedge of cars. Then, what if we
did like a tube shaped car? So, it's got

1076
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
did like a tube shaped car? So, it's got
 

1077
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,710
did like a tube shaped car? So, it's got
a big hole in the middle for all the air

1078
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
a big hole in the middle for all the air
 

1079
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,470
a big hole in the middle for all the air
to pass through, but it's shaped like a

1080
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
to pass through, but it's shaped like a
 

1081
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,789
to pass through, but it's shaped like a
circle and it actually can hold a

1082
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
circle and it actually can hold a
 

1083
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,630
circle and it actually can hold a
minifigure on the inside. I also want to

1084
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
minifigure on the inside. I also want to
 

1085
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,230
minifigure on the inside. I also want to
try building a teardrop. So, sort of

1086
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
try building a teardrop. So, sort of
 

1087
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,029
try building a teardrop. So, sort of
like an air foil on an airplane. It

1088
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
like an air foil on an airplane. It
 

1089
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,830
like an air foil on an airplane. It
looks like the boat from Spongebob.

1090
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
looks like the boat from Spongebob.
 

1091
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,430
looks like the boat from Spongebob.
We could also do one that's like just a

1092
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,440
We could also do one that's like just a
 

1093
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,510
We could also do one that's like just a
circle but like horizontal. So, the air

1094
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
circle but like horizontal. So, the air
 

1095
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,029
circle but like horizontal. So, the air
will kind of flow around the sides.

1096
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
will kind of flow around the sides.
 

1097
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,710
will kind of flow around the sides.
Look, it's like a little drift car. What

1098
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
Look, it's like a little drift car. What
 

1099
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,950
Look, it's like a little drift car. What
if we built up a rocket car? That might

1100
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
if we built up a rocket car? That might
 

1101
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,390
if we built up a rocket car? That might
be pretty

1102
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,400

 

1103
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,270

cool. All right, there we have our

1104
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
cool. All right, there we have our
 

1105
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,270
cool. All right, there we have our
rocket. Let's see how aerodynamic it is.

1106
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
rocket. Let's see how aerodynamic it is.
 

1107
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,549
rocket. Let's see how aerodynamic it is.
I'm interested to see how this one's

1108
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
I'm interested to see how this one's
 

1109
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,830
I'm interested to see how this one's
going to react to the

1110
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:36,840
going to react to the
 

1111
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,950
going to react to the
fog. Seems to be working pretty well.

1112
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
fog. Seems to be working pretty well.
 

1113
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,070
fog. Seems to be working pretty well.
Well, a lot of the air is just going

1114
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
Well, a lot of the air is just going
 

1115
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,430
Well, a lot of the air is just going
right underneath, right? But yeah,

1116
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
right underneath, right? But yeah,
 

1117
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,950
right underneath, right? But yeah,
that's definitely an aerodynamic shape

1118
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
that's definitely an aerodynamic shape
 

1119
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,870
that's definitely an aerodynamic shape
for sure. However, I don't know how fast

1120
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
for sure. However, I don't know how fast
 

1121
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,230
for sure. However, I don't know how fast
this is going to be because it's adding

1122
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
this is going to be because it's adding
 

1123
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,830
this is going to be because it's adding
a lot of downforce because of such a

1124
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
a lot of downforce because of such a
 

1125
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,190
a lot of downforce because of such a
steep angle. Started off slow. Wow, it's

1126
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
steep angle. Started off slow. Wow, it's
 

1127
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,190
steep angle. Started off slow. Wow, it's
already

1128
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,200

 

1129
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,710

up. About 60 70 points, that one

1130
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
up. About 60 70 points, that one
 

1131
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,230
up. About 60 70 points, that one
definitely passes the lift test. So, for

1132
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
definitely passes the lift test. So, for
 

1133
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,150
definitely passes the lift test. So, for
aerodynamics, I'd give this one a 10 out

1134
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
aerodynamics, I'd give this one a 10 out
 

1135
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,590
aerodynamics, I'd give this one a 10 out
of 10. Still though, you're driving

1136
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
of 10. Still though, you're driving
 

1137
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,950
of 10. Still though, you're driving
around a triangle. I don't think it's

1138
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
around a triangle. I don't think it's
 

1139
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,950
around a triangle. I don't think it's
the best car design. Here we have our

1140
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
the best car design. Here we have our
 

1141
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,630
the best car design. Here we have our
air foil car. As you can see, it's

1142
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
air foil car. As you can see, it's
 

1143
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,310
air foil car. As you can see, it's
completely symmetrical with the top and

1144
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
completely symmetrical with the top and
 

1145
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,990
completely symmetrical with the top and
bottom being the same. And this is based

1146
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
bottom being the same. And this is based
 

1147
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,830
bottom being the same. And this is based
off an aircraft's air foil, which

1148
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
off an aircraft's air foil, which
 

1149
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,590
off an aircraft's air foil, which
essentially is just a cross-section of

1150
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
essentially is just a cross-section of
 

1151
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,190
essentially is just a cross-section of
the wing. It's pretty big. It might just

1152
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
the wing. It's pretty big. It might just
 

1153
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,230
the wing. It's pretty big. It might just
blow away.

1154
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,240
blow away.
 

1155
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,909
blow away.
Accelerate. Oh, yeah. I mean, it looks

1156
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:19,919
Accelerate. Oh, yeah. I mean, it looks
 

1157
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,990
Accelerate. Oh, yeah. I mean, it looks
just like an air foil. It's doing what

1158
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
just like an air foil. It's doing what
 

1159
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,750
just like an air foil. It's doing what
it's supposed to be doing. I feel like

1160
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760
it's supposed to be doing. I feel like
 

1161
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,270
it's supposed to be doing. I feel like
this one just wouldn't work very well as

1162
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
this one just wouldn't work very well as
 

1163
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,870
this one just wouldn't work very well as
a car, honestly. The air is definitely

1164
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
a car, honestly. The air is definitely
 

1165
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,710
a car, honestly. The air is definitely
flowing around it for sure, but if you

1166
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
flowing around it for sure, but if you
 

1167
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,150
flowing around it for sure, but if you
just have a little wind gust, the car

1168
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
just have a little wind gust, the car
 

1169
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,590
just have a little wind gust, the car
will just flip over. Let's do the lip

1170
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
will just flip over. Let's do the lip
 

1171
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,950
will just flip over. Let's do the lip
test, though, and see if that's actually

1172
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
test, though, and see if that's actually
 

1173
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,630
test, though, and see if that's actually
accurate.

1174
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,640
accurate.
 

1175
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,590
accurate.
Uhoh. That's not good.

1176
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
Uhoh. That's not good.
 

1177
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,350
Uhoh. That's not good.
That one's a fail, too. Unfortunately,

1178
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
That one's a fail, too. Unfortunately,
 

1179
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,950
That one's a fail, too. Unfortunately,
don't design your car like an air foil.

1180
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
don't design your car like an air foil.
 

1181
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,470
don't design your car like an air foil.
You don't want it to fly. That seems

1182
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
You don't want it to fly. That seems
 

1183
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,510
You don't want it to fly. That seems
kind of obvious. We probably didn't have

1184
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
kind of obvious. We probably didn't have
 

1185
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,270
kind of obvious. We probably didn't have
to test that. I'd give the air foil a 3

1186
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
to test that. I'd give the air foil a 3
 

1187
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,789
to test that. I'd give the air foil a 3
out of 10. Here we have our rocket car,

1188
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
out of 10. Here we have our rocket car,
 

1189
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,310
out of 10. Here we have our rocket car,
which sort of made sense as an idea, but

1190
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
which sort of made sense as an idea, but
 

1191
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,390
which sort of made sense as an idea, but
not for aerodynamics because there's a

1192
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
not for aerodynamics because there's a
 

1193
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,549
not for aerodynamics because there's a
rocket engine on the back. And

1194
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:55,559
rocket engine on the back. And
 

1195
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,230
rocket engine on the back. And
accelerate. Ooh, I can see it going

1196
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
accelerate. Ooh, I can see it going
 

1197
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,430
accelerate. Ooh, I can see it going
around the top and the bottom of the

1198
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
around the top and the bottom of the
 

1199
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,630
around the top and the bottom of the
rocket. So, I think it's working pretty

1200
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
rocket. So, I think it's working pretty
 

1201
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,789
rocket. So, I think it's working pretty
well. However, again with the symmetry,

1202
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
well. However, again with the symmetry,
 

1203
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,870
well. However, again with the symmetry,
that's not the most ideal thing if

1204
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
that's not the most ideal thing if
 

1205
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,390
that's not the most ideal thing if
you're going for speed. This isn't an

1206
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,400
you're going for speed. This isn't an
 

1207
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,830
you're going for speed. This isn't an
aircraft. You want to actually have

1208
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
aircraft. You want to actually have
 

1209
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,510
aircraft. You want to actually have
traction on the

1210
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:10,520
traction on the
 

1211
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,870
traction on the
ground. I give the rocket car a 5 out of

1212
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
ground. I give the rocket car a 5 out of
 

1213
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,549
ground. I give the rocket car a 5 out of
10. This here is probably my favorite

1214
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
10. This here is probably my favorite
 

1215
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,630
10. This here is probably my favorite
car I've designed, the tube-shaped car.

1216
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
car I've designed, the tube-shaped car.
 

1217
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,390
car I've designed, the tube-shaped car.
The idea with this one is the air will

1218
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
The idea with this one is the air will
 

1219
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,230
The idea with this one is the air will
just go straight through. Bound to be a

1220
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
just go straight through. Bound to be a
 

1221
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,909
just go straight through. Bound to be a
very windy ride. Speed of that air is

1222
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
very windy ride. Speed of that air is
 

1223
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,510
very windy ride. Speed of that air is
going to be blasting at the guy's face.

1224
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:24,520
going to be blasting at the guy's face.
 

1225
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,149
going to be blasting at the guy's face.
So, take a huff. Whoa, that's sick. Look

1226
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
So, take a huff. Whoa, that's sick. Look
 

1227
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,270
So, take a huff. Whoa, that's sick. Look
at that. It's just flowing right

1228
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
at that. It's just flowing right
 

1229
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,350
at that. It's just flowing right
through. But again, if you have just the

1230
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
through. But again, if you have just the
 

1231
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,710
through. But again, if you have just the
wrong angle of air, it could actually

1232
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
wrong angle of air, it could actually
 

1233
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,789
wrong angle of air, it could actually
lift up the top of that tube and you'd

1234
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
lift up the top of that tube and you'd
 

1235
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,630
lift up the top of that tube and you'd
go

1236
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:37,640

 

1237
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,510

flying. Oh, that's not good. Oh, no. Oh,

1238
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
flying. Oh, that's not good. Oh, no. Oh,
 

1239
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,960
flying. Oh, that's not good. Oh, no. Oh,
that's terrible.

1240
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:42,970
that's terrible.
 

1241
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,870
that's terrible.
[Music]

1242
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
[Music]
 

1243
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,029
[Music]
Yeah, it's gone. If you were in a car

1244
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
Yeah, it's gone. If you were in a car
 

1245
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,549
Yeah, it's gone. If you were in a car
driving like this and then you flipped

1246
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
driving like this and then you flipped
 

1247
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,070
driving like this and then you flipped
over, that's like a double whammy. So,

1248
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
over, that's like a double whammy. So,
 

1249
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,830
over, that's like a double whammy. So,
the tube car is a fail. I'm going to

1250
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
the tube car is a fail. I'm going to
 

1251
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,710
the tube car is a fail. I'm going to
call this one like the Spongebob car.

1252
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
call this one like the Spongebob car.

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,230
call this one like the Spongebob car.
The idea for this is that the air would

1254
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
The idea for this is that the air would
 

1255
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,830
The idea for this is that the air would
just go right around the sides and kind

1256
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
just go right around the sides and kind
 

1257
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,590
just go right around the sides and kind
of bounce off, but it's also perfectly

1258
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
of bounce off, but it's also perfectly
 

1259
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,070
of bounce off, but it's also perfectly
flat, unlike a regular saucer. I like to

1260
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
flat, unlike a regular saucer. I like to
 

1261
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,070
flat, unlike a regular saucer. I like to
fill it up first and then take off cuz

1262
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
fill it up first and then take off cuz
 

1263
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,310
fill it up first and then take off cuz
it just looks sick. It looks like the

1264
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
it just looks sick. It looks like the
 

1265
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,990
it just looks sick. It looks like the
car is moving cuz the atmosphere stays

1266
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
car is moving cuz the atmosphere stays
 

1267
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,430
car is moving cuz the atmosphere stays
in the same place, but okay. Yeah. So,

1268
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,440
in the same place, but okay. Yeah. So,
 

1269
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,549
in the same place, but okay. Yeah. So,
for this one, it's definitely going

1270
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
for this one, it's definitely going
 

1271
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,230
for this one, it's definitely going
around the edges. It's also catching a

1272
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
around the edges. It's also catching a
 

1273
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,510
around the edges. It's also catching a
lot of it underneath. I think it's

1274
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
lot of it underneath. I think it's
 

1275
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,430
lot of it underneath. I think it's
actually coming up through the cabin.

1276
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
actually coming up through the cabin.
 

1277
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,029
actually coming up through the cabin.
The windscreen's also not bad. That's a

1278
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
The windscreen's also not bad. That's a
 

1279
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,470
The windscreen's also not bad. That's a
very aerodynamic windscreen. I'd give

1280
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
very aerodynamic windscreen. I'd give
 

1281
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,750
very aerodynamic windscreen. I'd give
this one probably the lowest of the

1282
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
this one probably the lowest of the
 

1283
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,510
this one probably the lowest of the
video. Three out of 10. Let's see the
