Each extension folder of v0.03 (not for v0.01, not for v0.02), will have a folder named "dashboard", along with an streamlit app.py that will be using things in the dashboard folder (for tab views, etc.).

For v0.03, it's really important because streamlit app.py will put the streamlit tabs in the dashboard folder to make things more modular.

Streamlit app.py will be used principly to run scripts in the scripts folder, with adjustable parameters.
