In v0.03, in the folder "./extensions/heuristics-v0.03", we can extend things in v0.02. The point is to show that from v0.02, there is progression, that's how softwares/code/systems evolve.

What is added:
- app.py , a streamlit app for lauching those different agents (with one or several different arguments, at least the max-games argument), and shows replay (with pygame and flask web mode, both). You can check app.py in the ROOT for task0 for some inspiration (check the folder "dashboard" in the ROOT, the session_utils.py in the folder "utils" in the ROOT).
- We have to add things like replay mode code. But we will really re-use very very extensively what is provided in those base classes and utils from Task0 in ROOT directory. 


Do it now, in "./extensions/heuristics-v0.03". I have already copied the code from "./extensions/heuristics-v0.02" to "./extensions/heuristics-v0.03". You can and should improve the code in "./extensions/heuristics-v0.03".

We will also put all those agents in the folder "./extensions/heuristics-v0.03/agents" .


I have also moved main.py into scripts folder. app.py will be the entry point for users.
