{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Move down twice to decrease y-coordinate from 5 to 3, avoiding the body to the right, then move right to reach the apple at (4,3). This path respects the no-reversal rule from the initial LEFT direction and ensures a safe move exists after eating."
