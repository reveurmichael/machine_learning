enjoy so this flower is from my
 

9
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,829
enjoy so this flower is from my
animation

10
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:12,839
animation
 

11
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,950
animation
metamorphosis which I created in

12
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:15,960
metamorphosis which I created in
 

13
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,830
metamorphosis which I created in
2010 but only uploaded to this channel

14
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:18,840
2010 but only uploaded to this channel
 

15
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,710
2010 but only uploaded to this channel
in the past week the color scheme I'm

16
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
in the past week the color scheme I'm
 

17
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,509
in the past week the color scheme I'm
using in that animation is very limited

18
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:24,519
using in that animation is very limited
 

19
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,390
using in that animation is very limited
it's just four colors black yellow red

20
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
it's just four colors black yellow red
 

21
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,269
it's just four colors black yellow red
and white so that's why this flower is

22
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
and white so that's why this flower is
 

23
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,830
and white so that's why this flower is
black red and yellow but as you can see

24
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
black red and yellow but as you can see
 

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,709
black red and yellow but as you can see
I've also built it in this other color

26
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:35,719
I've also built it in this other color
 

27
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,950
I've also built it in this other color
for this video green yellow and blue so

28
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
for this video green yellow and blue so
 

29
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,590
for this video green yellow and blue so
you can build this flower in whatever

30
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:40,600
you can build this flower in whatever
 

31

35
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,790
needs let's get building these are the
pieces you'll need to build the stem of

36
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:49,800
pieces you'll need to build the stem of
 

37
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,630
pieces you'll need to build the stem of
the flower so start off with two 2x4

00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,640
the flower so start off with two 2x4
 

39
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,670
the flower so start off with two 2x4
bricks push those together connect them

40
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:56,680
bricks push those together connect them
 

41
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,110
bricks push those together connect them
with a 2X two brick and then do two more

42
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,120
with a 2X two brick and then do two more
 

43
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,470
with a 2X two brick and then do two more
2x2 bricks on top of

2x2 bricks on top of
 

45
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,710
2x2 bricks on top of
that then we're going to go with a 2x3

46
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:05,720
that then we're going to go with a 2x3
 

47
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,270
that then we're going to go with a 2x3
brick go offset one then do a stack of

48
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,280
brick go offset one then do a stack of
 

49
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,149

three 2x two

50
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
three 2x two
 

51
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,789
three 2x two
bricks stick that on the other side then

52
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:15,799
bricks stick that on the other side then
 

53
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,310
bricks stick that on the other side then
go back to the center with another 2x3

54
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
go back to the center with another 2x3
 

55
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,789
go back to the center with another 2x3
brick another stack of three 2x2

00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
brick another stack of three 2x2
 

57
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,789
brick another stack of three 2x2
bricks and then we're going to top the

58
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
bricks and then we're going to top the
 

59
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,350
bricks and then we're going to top the
whole thing off with a 2x4

60
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
whole thing off with a 2x4
 

61
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,469
whole thing off with a 2x4
brick these are the pieces you'll need

62

brick these are the pieces you'll need
 

63
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,870
brick these are the pieces you'll need
for the center of the top of the flower

64
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:31,880
for the center of the top of the flower
 

65
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,950
for the center of the top of the flower
to start off with you'll want a 2x6

66
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
to start off with you'll want a 2x6
 

67
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,789
to start off with you'll want a 2x6
brick if you have one of those or you

68

brick if you have one of those or you
 

69
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,950
brick if you have one of those or you
can substitute it with some 2x3 bricks

70
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:37,960
can substitute it with some 2x3 bricks
 

71
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,950
can substitute it with some 2x3 bricks
like I've done here then you're going to

72
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:39,960
like I've done here then you're going to
 

73
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,670
like I've done here then you're going to
put some 2x2 bricks around

74
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
put some 2x2 bricks around
 

75
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,190
put some 2x2 bricks around
that now to give some stability to this

76
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,200
that now to give some stability to this
 

77
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,670
that now to give some stability to this
we're going to connect it with a 2x8

78
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:48,680
we're going to connect it with a 2x8
 

79
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,749
we're going to connect it with a 2x8
brick going this

80
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759

 

81
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,350

way and another one of those going that

82
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
way and another one of those going that
 

83
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,590
way and another one of those going that
way uh and then on each side here we're

84
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
way uh and then on each side here we're
 

85
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,870
way uh and then on each side here we're
going to do a 2x4 brick

86
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
going to do a 2x4 brick
 

87
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,469
going to do a 2x4 brick
that's going to be the center of our

direction another 2x two then we're
 

97
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,430
direction another 2x two then we're
going to take some 1X tws to fill this

98
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
going to take some 1X tws to fill this
 

99
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,470
going to take some 1X tws to fill this
out so one by tw's there and there and 1

100
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,480
out so one by tw's there and there and 1
 

101
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,390
out so one by tw's there and there and 1
by tw's Under This 2x4

102
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,400
by tw's Under This 2x4
 

103
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,309
by tw's Under This 2x4
here that's going to be the center of

104
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:27,319
here that's going to be the center of
 

105
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,350
here that's going to be the center of
our flower if you're feeling ambitious

106
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
our flower if you're feeling ambitious
 

107
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,030
our flower if you're feeling ambitious
you can go ahead and connect that to the

108
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
you can go ahead and connect that to the
 

109
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,030
you can go ahead and connect that to the
stem I'd suggest having the 2x4 brick go

110
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,040
stem I'd suggest having the 2x4 brick go
 

111
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,430
stem I'd suggest having the 2x4 brick go
across that 2x6 or 2x

112
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
across that 2x6 or 2x
 

113
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,110
across that 2x6 or 2x
3s these are the pieces you need for one

114
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,120
3s these are the pieces you need for one
 

115
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,790
3s these are the pieces you need for one
petal of the flower so for the flower

116
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
petal of the flower so for the flower
 

117
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,390
petal of the flower so for the flower
petal take two 2x6 bricks or this could

118
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
petal take two 2x6 bricks or this could
 

119
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,790
petal take two 2x6 bricks or this could
be four 2x3 bricks if you don't have 2X

120
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
be four 2x3 bricks if you don't have 2X
 

121
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,630
be four 2x3 bricks if you don't have 2X
sixes connect them with a 2x3 brick like

122
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
sixes connect them with a 2x3 brick like
 

123
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,869
sixes connect them with a 2x3 brick like
so then put a 2x4 brick on each side

124
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:57,879
so then put a 2x4 brick on each side
 

125
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,830
so then put a 2x4 brick on each side
going

126
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:58,840
going
 

127
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,190
going
down then down here we're going to do a

128
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
down then down here we're going to do a
 

129
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,390
down then down here we're going to do a
2X two brick and a 1x two brick now

130
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:05,400
2X two brick and a 1x two brick now
 

131
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,070
2X two brick and a 1x two brick now
we're going to build three more of those

132
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
we're going to build three more of those
 

133
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,750
we're going to build three more of those
and then at the top of our flower we're

134
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
and then at the top of our flower we're
 

135
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,270
and then at the top of our flower we're
going to take the petals and attach them

136
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,280
going to take the petals and attach them
 

137
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,270
going to take the petals and attach them
to the

138
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
