========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to move the snake from (5,8) to eat the apple at (5,9). 

First, looking at the current state: the head is at (5,8), and it's moving right. The body cells are [(4,8), (3,8), ..., (1,4)], which means the snake is currently extending from the head all the way down to (1,4). The apple is just one cell above the head at (5,9).

Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT because that's the opposite direction. So my options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But wait, moving RIGHT from (5,8) would take me to (6,8). But I need to check if this new head position collides with any body cells except possibly the tail when it moves. The current body cells after the head are [(4,8), ...], so moving right to (6,8) doesn't collide because none of the body cells are at (6,8). Also, since I'm moving towards the apple which is directly above, maybe a better approach is to move UP.

So let's consider moving UP first. The new head would be (5,9), which is exactly where the apple is. That seems perfect because then I can eat the apple and grow the snake. But I need to make sure that this move doesn't cause any collisions.

Looking at the body cells: after inserting the old head into the body list, the body becomes [old_head (5,8), (4,8), ...]. The new head is (5,9). Now, I need to check if (5,9) is occupied by any body cell except possibly the tail. Since the body cells are all below and left of the head, none of them are at (5,9). So this move should be safe.

When moving UP, since new_head equals apple position, we grow the snake by not removing the tail. That means the body increases in length by one. After eating, the head is at (5,9), and the body includes all previous segments plus the old head.

I also need to ensure that after eating, there's at least one legal move next turn. Since the apple was just eaten, the snake grows, but as long as we're not blocking our own path, it should be fine. In this case, since the apple is directly above and we moved into it, the next moves can adjust accordingly.

So moving UP from (5,8) to (5,9) seems like a safe and efficient way to reach the apple.
