  "moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move left to decrease the x-coordinate from 9 to 8 and down to decrease the y-coordinate from 6 to 5. The first move is LEFT to avoid reversing direction from RIGHT. Subsequent moves adjust the position while avoiding the body. The final RIGHT move ensures alignment with the apple after detouring around the body."
