Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (8,9) to the apple at (0,7). Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the current state. The head is at (8,9), which is near the top-right corner of the grid. The body segments are [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)], meaning the snake is extending downward from the head all the way to (8,5). The current direction is "UP", so the next move can't be "DOWN" because you can't reverse direction on the first move.

The apple is at (0,7), which is quite a distance away. To reach there, the snake needs to move left several times and also down a bit since it's currently at y=9 and the apple is at y=7. Wait, no—wait, in the coordinate system, UP increases y, so from 9 to 7 would require moving DOWN twice.

Wait, but the head is already at (8,9). The body goes down to (8,5), which suggests that the snake's tail is at (8,5). So the snake is long, and its body blocks certain paths.

The goal is to move from (8,9) to (0,7). That requires moving left 8 units (from x=8 to x=0) and down 2 units (from y=9 to y=7).

But the current direction is UP, so the first move can't be DOWN. Wait no—current direction is "UP", so the next move cannot be "DOWN" because of rule 2: you can't reverse direction on the first move if the current direction isn't NONE. Wait, wait—the current direction is "UP". So for the first move, any direction except the opposite (which would be "DOWN") is allowed? Or does the rule say that you can't choose the opposite direction as the next move regardless of whether it's the first or not?

Wait, the movement rules state: "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed."

So since the current direction is "UP", the next move can't be "DOWN". So from (8,9), possible initial moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But wait, the head is at (8,9). Moving UP would take it to y=10, which is outside the grid—so that's invalid and would cause death. So moving UP isn't an option.

So the first move can be either LEFT or RIGHT. Wait no—if current direction is "UP", then next move can't be DOWN. But moving LEFT or RIGHT is allowed as they aren't the opposite of UP. Wait, wait: the opposite directions are UP/DOWN and LEFT/RIGHT? Or is it that each direction has a direct opposite, like UP's opposite is DOWN, and LEFT's opposite is RIGHT.

Yes, so if current direction is "UP", next move can't be "DOWN". Similarly, if current direction is "LEFT", next can't be "RIGHT" and vice versa. So in this case, since the current direction is "UP", the next move cannot be "DOWN". But that doesn't restrict LEFT or RIGHT.

Wait no—current direction is "UP", so the only forbidden direction is "DOWN". So first move can be UP (but that's invalid because it would go out of bounds), LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait, wait—the current direction is given as "UP", which means the last movement was in that direction. The next move must not be the opposite. So from "UP", you can't choose "DOWN" next.

So possible first moves are UP (invalid because it would go out of bounds), LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait no—NONE is a state when the snake hasn't moved yet. In this case, the current direction is "UP", meaning the snake was moving in that direction previously. So for the next move, you can choose any direction except the opposite.

Wait, but the initial problem says: "If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed." But here, the current direction isn't NONE; it's UP. So the next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but moving UP from (8,9) would go to y=10, which is invalid). So possible initial moves are LEFT and RIGHT.

Wait no—current direction is "UP", so you cannot choose "DOWN" as the next move. But you can choose any other direction, including UP again? Wait no—can you change direction or must you keep moving in the same direction unless you turn?

No, I think that's a misunderstanding. The movement rules don't say anything about needing to continue in the same direction; they just prohibit reversing (i.e., choosing the opposite direction). So from "UP", you can choose any direction except "DOWN".

So possible first moves are UP (invalid), LEFT, RIGHT, or even NONE? Wait no—NONE isn't a valid movement direction. The valid directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

Wait, but in this case, the current direction is UP, so the next move can be any of the four except DOWN. So possible moves: UP (invalid), LEFT, RIGHT, or maybe even NONE? Wait no—NONE isn't a movement; it's just a state when the snake hasn't moved yet. So from "UP", you can choose UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Wait but moving UP would take the head to (8,10), which is outside the grid, causing death. So that's not allowed. So the first move must be either LEFT or RIGHT.

But wait—the current direction is UP, and the snake is at (8,9). If I choose LEFT as the next move, that would take the head to (7,9). But I need to check if that's a valid move without causing collision.

Wait, let me think about the body. The body cells are [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. So after moving LEFT, the new head would be at (7,9). Then, we need to check if this new head position collides with any of the body segments except possibly the tail when it moves.

Wait, but according to rule 3: If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies. So in this case, after moving LEFT, the new head is at (7,9). The body segments are [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. None of these are at (7,9), so no collision there.

But wait—the tail is at (8,5). After the move, the body would update. Let's think about that:

If I choose LEFT as the first move:

1. New head: (7,9)
2. Check for collisions: new_head is within bounds and not in body except possibly the tail when it moves.
3. Body update:
   a. Insert old head (8,9) at front of body list, which becomes [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)].
   b. Since new_head is not apple position (which is at (0,7)), we remove the tail (8,5). So body becomes [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].

Wait no—the initial body cells are given as [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)], which is from behind the head to tail. After inserting the old head (8,9) at front, the body becomes [ (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5) ] if we don't eat an apple. Then, since we didn't eat the apple, we remove the last element (tail), so body becomes [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].

Wait no—wait, the initial body is given as [BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN], which are from behind head to tail. So after inserting old head at front, the new body list before removing the tail would be [old_head] + current_body = [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. Then, since we didn't eat the apple, we remove the last element, so the body becomes [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].

So after moving LEFT, the new head is at (7,9), and the body is [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. Then, in the next move, we can proceed.

But wait—the apple is at (0,7). So from (7,9), I need to get left several times. But let's see if this path would work.

Alternatively, what if I choose RIGHT as the first move? That would take the head to (9,9), but x=9 is within bounds (since grid is 10x10, from 0-9). Wait no—wait, moving right from (8,9) would be x+1, which is 9. So new_head is (9,9). That's valid.

But then the body would be updated: insert old head (8,9) at front, making body [(9,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]? Wait no—the initial body is [ (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5) ]. So inserting old head (8,9) would make the new body list before removing tail: [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. Then remove last element if no apple eaten.

But then, after moving RIGHT, the head is at (9,9). From there, I can start moving left and down. But that might be a longer path.

Wait but let's consider whether choosing LEFT or RIGHT as the first move is better in terms of avoiding body collisions and planning a path to the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move DOWN first, but wait—current direction is UP, so next move can't be DOWN. So that's not allowed.

Wait no—the current direction is UP, so next move cannot be DOWN. So first move options are LEFT or RIGHT (since moving UP would go out of bounds).

So between LEFT and RIGHT:

If I choose LEFT first:

- Head moves to (7,9)
- Body becomes [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]
- Next, perhaps move DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8). Wait but current direction after moving LEFT is now LEFT? Or does the direction change based on the movement?

Wait no—the movement direction changes each time you move. So if I first moved LEFT, then the new direction is LEFT, meaning next move can't be RIGHT.

But wait, no—wait, the rule says you can't reverse directions. So if I choose LEFT as the first move, then the next move can't be RIGHT (since LEFT and RIGHT are opposites). Similarly, if I choose RIGHT first, next can't be LEFT.

Wait no—the rules say: "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'." So each pair (UP/DOWN and LEFT/RIGHT) are reverses. So if current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT next.

So after moving LEFT, the new direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT.

But in any case, to reach (0,7), I need to make a lot of left moves and some down moves. But given that the initial body is blocking certain paths, perhaps it's better to plan a path that avoids collision with the body.

Wait but after the first move LEFT, the body segments would be:

- Head at (7,9)
- Body: [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]

So from (7,9), moving DOWN to (7,8) would take me to a position that's not in the body except perhaps if the tail moves.

Wait no—the body after first move is:

After inserting old head (8,9) at front: [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. Then remove last element since we didn't eat apple: new body is [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].

Wait no—the initial body is [BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODY4] = [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. After inserting old head (8,9) at front, the new list before removing tail is [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. Then, since we didn't eat apple, remove last element: body becomes [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].

Wait no—the initial body is given as [BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODY4] = [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]. So when we insert the old head at front, it's added to the beginning of this list. Then, if we don't eat apple, we remove the last element (the tail). So new body would be [old_head] + current_body[:-1], which is [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].

So after moving LEFT, the body is [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)], and head is at (7,9).

Now, from there, I can move DOWN to (7,8). Let's see if that's allowed:

- New head: (7,8)
- Check collision with body: body is [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. The new head (7,8) isn't in this list except perhaps the tail when it moves.

Wait no—the collision check is whether new_head is in any BODYi except possibly the tail's current position before movement. Wait, rule 3 says: "If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies."

So after moving LEFT and then DOWN, the body would be:

After first move (LEFT):

- Head: (7,9)
- Body: [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]

Then, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8):

1. New head: (7,8)
2. Check collision: body is still [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. The new head (7,8) isn't in the body except perhaps (8,8). Wait no—(7,8) vs (8,8): different x-coordinate.

Wait no—the body after first move is [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. So new head at (7,8) isn't in any of these positions. So no collision.

Then, update the body:

a. Insert old head (7,9) at front: new list before tail removal is [(7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].
b. Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element: body becomes [(7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7)].

Wait no—the initial body after first move is [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. Wait no—after inserting old head (8,9) at front, the new list before removing tail was [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)], then remove last to get [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

After first move (LEFT):

- Head moves from (8,9) to (7,9).
- Body was initially [ (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5) ].
- Insert old head at front: new body list becomes [ (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5) ].
- Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element: new body is [ (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6) ].

Then, moving DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8):

- New head: (7,8)
- Check collision with current body [ (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6) ]. None of these are at (7,8).
- Insert old head (7,9) at front: new list before tail removal is [ (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6) ].
- Remove last element (since no apple eaten): body becomes [ (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7) ].

So now, the head is at (7,8), and the body is [ (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7) ].

Continuing this way would allow us to move further left and down as needed. But perhaps a more efficient path would be to move directly left multiple times, then down when necessary.

But wait—the apple is at (0,7). So from (8,9), moving left 8 times would take us to x=0, but we need to also adjust y from 9 to 7. Alternatively, perhaps a combination of left and down moves.

Wait no—if I move left all the way first:

From (8,9):

1. Move LEFT: (7,9)
2. Move LEFT: (6,9)
3. ... continue until x=0 at y=9.

But then from (0,9), I need to move DOWN twice to reach y=7.

But wait—the body would be extending as we move left, and we have to ensure that the head doesn't collide with its own body after each move.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first move down a few times before moving left extensively to avoid the body blocking the path.

Wait but current direction is UP, so initial moves can't be DOWN. So first move must be LEFT or RIGHT.

If I choose RIGHT as the first move:

- Head moves from (8,9) to (9,9)
- Body becomes [ (9,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6) ] after removing last element.

But then moving DOWN would require changing direction and not being blocked by the previous body positions.

Wait but I'm getting bogged down in the details. Perhaps a better approach is to outline a step-by-step path:

1. First move: LEFT
2. Then move DOWN as much as possible, then continue left.
3. Repeat until reaching (0,7).

Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to just choose a direction and proceed, ensuring that each move doesn't cause collision.

But given the complexity, maybe the key is that after the first move, you can navigate around the body by combining left and down moves.

However, considering all this, I think the answer expects a simple "Yes" or "No"—whether it's possible. Given that the snake can maneuver by moving in different directions (left, right, up, down), avoiding its own body after each move, it should be possible to reach the target position (0,7) after several moves.

So, putting it all together, I would say Yes, it is possible.
</think>

Yes, the snake can successfully navigate from its starting position at (8,9) to the target position at (0,7). By making a series of left and down movements while avoiding collisions with its own body, the snake can reach the desired location. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The snake starts at (8,9).
2. It moves LEFT to (7,9), then continues moving LEFT repeatedly until it reaches x=0.
3. Once at (0,9), it changes direction and moves DOWN twice to reach y=7.
4. Throughout the process, the snake avoids colliding with its own body by ensuring each new head position doesn't overlap with any part of the current body segments.

Answer: \boxed{Yes}
