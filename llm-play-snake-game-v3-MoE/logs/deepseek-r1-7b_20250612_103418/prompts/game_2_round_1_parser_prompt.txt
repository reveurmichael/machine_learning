========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to guide the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (5,3). The snake's current direction is "NONE," which means it can choose any initial direction without worrying about reversing. 

First, let's think about the apple's position relative to the head. It's directly two cells below the head since both are on x=5. So moving down twice should work if there's a clear path.

But wait, I need to check if moving down is possible without causing any collisions. The current body of the snake includes (4,3) and other segments that are blocking my way. If I move down each time, will the snake collide with its own body?

Looking at the movement rules, when the head moves, we have to ensure it doesn't land on any body segment except possibly the tail if it's about to grow. Since the apple is adjacent but not yet reached, moving down should be safe as long as there's space.

I'll plan two moves: first "DOWN" and then another "DOWN." This will move the head from (5,5) to (5,4) after the first move and then to (5,3), where the apple is. I need to verify that these movements don't result in any collisions with body segments.

Considering the body cells are [(4,3), (4,2), etc.], moving down doesn't seem to interfere because those are two rows away. So after each move, the snake's body will shift forward without overlapping.

Also, since I'm not reversing direction initially, it follows the rules. The final path should have zero horizontal moves and a net of -2 vertical moves (since y decreases by 2). That matches the required condition.

I think this plan is safe and avoids any immediate collisions or grid issues.
</think>

```json
{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "Move down twice to reach the apple without colliding with body segments. The initial direction is NONE, so moving down is allowed."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 3). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
