  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (2, 0) and needs to reach (7, 1). The Manhattan distance requires 5 RIGHT moves and 1 UP move. The first move is RIGHT to avoid reversing direction from the initial RIGHT. Subsequent moves continue toward the apple while avoiding collisions with the body or walls."
