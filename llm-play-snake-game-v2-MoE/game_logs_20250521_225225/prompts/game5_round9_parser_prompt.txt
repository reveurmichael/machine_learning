Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this snake game problem. So, the snake is at (0,8), which is the top-left corner of a 10x10 grid. The apple is at (3,8). The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, right, or none. But it can't reverse direction on its first move.

First, I need to plan a path for the snake's head to reach the apple without hitting itself or going out of bounds. Right now, the snake is at (0,8), and the body is at (0,6) and (0,7). So the snake is vertical, occupying columns 0 from y=6 to y=8.

The goal is to get the head from (0,8) to (3,8). Since it's moving rightwards along the same row, that should be straightforward. But we have to make sure the snake doesn't collide with its body or walls as it moves.

Let me calculate how many steps are needed. From x=0 to x=3, so 3 steps to the right (RIGHT moves). Y remains the same at 8, so no UP or DOWN moves are needed. So the plan is probably three RIGHT moves.

But wait, the snake can't reverse direction on the first move. The initial direction is currently not specified, but let's assume it starts moving towards the apple because otherwise, if it's facing left, that would be a reversal from nothing. Hmm, no, actually, the initial direction isn't given; maybe we need to figure out what direction the snake is initially facing.

Wait, looking back at the input: The head position is (0,8), and current direction is UP. So the snake's head is moving upwards first. But since it's already at y=8, which is the top of the grid, moving up would take it out of bounds to (0,9). That can't be right.

Wait, no—the initial position is (0,8), and direction is UP. So moving UP from (0,8) would be (0,9). But that's outside the grid because y ranges from 0 to 9? Wait, in a 10x10 grid, are x and y both between 0 and 9 inclusive? Because it says coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So moving up increases y by 1? Or is that reversed?

Wait, in coordinate systems, often UP would be increasing y if you consider the origin at the bottom. But here, according to the example: From (1,1), moving UP goes to (1,2). Moving DOWN goes to (1,0). So yes, y increases when moving UP and decreases when moving DOWN.

So from (0,8), moving UP would take it to (0,9), which is outside the grid because 0 ≤ x <10 and same for y. So that's invalid. But since the initial direction is given as UP, perhaps this is a problem in the input? Or maybe the snake can't move in the current direction if it leads it out of bounds.

Wait, but according to rule 2, movement is done per step based on direction vectors. The head moves by adding the direction vector each time.

So from (0,8), moving UP would be y-1 → wait no: "UP" is y+1? Wait in the example, from (1,1): UP is (1,2). So yes, moving UP increases y by 1. So from (0,8), moving UP would take it to (0,9), which is outside the grid because y must be less than 10.

So perhaps the initial direction of UP is invalid? Or maybe I misunderstood something. Wait, but according to rule 4, if it moves out of bounds, the snake dies. So the initial move can't be UP because that would take it beyond the grid.

But the problem says "current direction: UP". So perhaps we need to handle this case where moving in the current direction is invalid? Or maybe the initial position's next step after the first move has to consider possible reversals?

Wait, rule 3 states that if the snake cannot reverse on the first move. But since it's already facing UP and hasn't moved yet, perhaps moving UP again would be a reversal.

But wait, in the first move, can the snake choose not to move? No, because each move is a step toward eating the apple. So the initial direction must allow for movement without causing death.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe we should assume that after planning the path, moving RIGHT three times will be straightforward as long as it doesn't hit its body or walls.

Wait, let's look at the snake's body: [(0,6), (0,7)]. So from head (0,8) to tail (0,6). When moving right once, the new head is (1,8). The body segments shift left by one. But wait, no—the body would follow if it moves forward.

Wait, in a snake game, when you move forward, the next segment follows where the head was. So when the head moves to (0+1, 8) = (1,8), but before that movement, the body at (0,7) becomes the new tail? No, actually, no—the body segments shift in the direction of movement.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the snake's body would change after each move. The current body is [(0,6), (0,7)]. So positions 0 to y=8 for x=0.

When moving RIGHT once: head becomes (1,8). Then the next segment in the direction of movement follows? Or do all segments shift accordingly?

Wait no—when you move forward, each segment moves one step. But with a snake that's vertical, moving right would cause it to extend its body to the right.

So after moving RIGHT once:

- Head: (1,8)
- The previous head at (0,8) is now the tail, so the next part of the body follows in front. Wait no—no, when you move forward, each segment moves one step in the direction of movement, except the first which becomes the new head.

So if we have a snake with segments [A, B, C], where A is head and C is tail, moving right would result in:

- New head: (x+1, y)
- Then B becomes the new head's position? Or do all parts move?

I think I need to clarify how the body follows. In most snake games, each part of the body follows the previous segment into its next cell.

So for example, if you have a vertical line of three cells: (0,8), (0,7), (0,6). Moving RIGHT would make the head (1,8). Then, the next segment (which was at (0,8)) moves to (1,8)'s position. Wait no—each part follows where it was.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to model each move step by step.

Current body: [(0,8), (0,7), (0,6)]? Or is the head at (0,8) and the body behind?

No—the snake has a head moving in a direction. So if the current direction is UP, then from (0,8), it would try to move to (0,9). But that's invalid.

So perhaps the initial direction can't be UP because moving UP would take it out of bounds. Therefore, maybe there was a mistake in the input?

Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore this and just proceed with planning the path without worrying about whether each step is valid or not, assuming that after movement, the snake doesn't die.

But for the purpose of solving the problem, let's assume we can move RIGHT three times. So from (0,8), moving RIGHT to (1,8). Then, next, since the body is at (0,6) and (0,7), when it moves right again, does that cause any collision?

After first move: head is (1,8); body shifts so previous segments are now in front. Wait no—if the snake was moving RIGHT, then each part of its body follows into the cell behind.

So for a vertical snake at x=0 from y=6 to 8:

Moving RIGHT once would make it occupy x=1 and still be vertical, but shifted right by one. So segments [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. No collision with itself because body is now at x=1.

Second move: head moves to (2,8); snake becomes [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]—still no self-collision.

Third move: head moves to (3,8). Now the snake's segments are [(3,8), (3,7), (3,6)]. No collision again.

So in these three steps, moving RIGHT each time doesn't cause any collision. Also, since we're not reversing direction on the first move—it's only a problem if you try to reverse from your current heading.

Wait but initially, the snake is facing UP, but that would take it out of bounds when trying to move first step—so perhaps the initial position after movement is invalid? So maybe this can't happen. Therefore, moving in the UP direction isn't allowed because it's already at y=8 and would go beyond.

Wait no—if the current direction is UP, then the head will try to move up from (0,8), which goes to (0,9)—invalid. So perhaps that initial position or direction is invalid?

But the problem states "current direction: UP"—so maybe we have to consider it as valid but impossible because moving in that direction would cause an out-of-bound.

Hmm, this seems like a contradiction. Maybe I need to disregard this and assume that movement can be done without dying—like perhaps the initial position is adjusted so that the first move doesn't go beyond.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to just focus on getting from (0,8) to (3,8), regardless of whether each intermediate step causes a collision with itself or not. So in this case, we can have three RIGHT moves without any self-collision because each time it's moving right and building up as new segments.

So the total number of moves required is 3 steps: move RIGHT once to get from (0,8) to (1,8), then again to (2,8), then again to (3,8).

But let me double-check for any possible self-collisions:

First move: head at (1,8); body was [(0,6), (0,7)] → after moving right, it's [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. So no collision.

Second move: head at (2,8); previous segments were [(1,8), (1,7)], now moved to [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] → still fine.

Third move: head at (3,8); body becomes [(3,8), (3,7), (3,6)] → no collision.

So yes, moving RIGHT three times would get the snake from (0,8) to (3,8). Therefore, it requires 3 moves. But wait—is each move counted as a single step or multiple?

Wait in the problem statement, does "number of steps" refer to how many directional commands are given? Each command is one movement.

Yes, so for three moves: RIGHT x3.

But let me think again—does moving RIGHT once cause any collision?

First move: from (0,8) → (1,8). The body was [(0,6), (0,7)] → after first move it's [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. So no overlap with previous positions except in the direction of movement.

Wait no—the snake is moving from x=0 to x=1. Initially, at t=0: head at (0,8). After moving RIGHT once, head moves to (1,8); and the rest follow accordingly. So for each step:

t=0: segments [(0,8), (0,7), (0,6)]
t=1: move RIGHT → [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]
t=2: move RIGHT again → [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]
t=3: move RIGHT third time → [(3,8), (3,7), (3,6)]

Each step is fine as long as the new head doesn't overlap with any of the previous body parts.

Wait wait—when moving to t=1, does the head at (1,8) collide with the old position?

No—the old head was at (0,8). The new segments are [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)], so no collision because (1,8) is not in the previous positions except perhaps if any segment moves into an existing one. But since it's moving forward, all other parts follow.

So each step seems safe.

Therefore, I think that 3 steps to the right would solve this.

Wait but let me check for another thing—does the snake need to have its tail in a particular position?

No—the problem only states about getting from (0,8) to (3,8). So as long as the head can reach there without colliding with any part of itself except perhaps the body parts that were moved.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something because when moving right multiple times, each step could potentially cause a collision with the previous body segments if it's in the same column. But no—since all are shifted to new columns, x increases by 1 each time.

So yeah, three moves seem sufficient.
</think>

The snake needs to move from position (0,8) to (3,8). Each step involves moving right once without causing any self-collisions because the body shifts accordingly. Therefore, it requires exactly three steps.

$\boxed{3}$
