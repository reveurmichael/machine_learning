========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I need to help the snake navigate from position (1,6) towards the apple at (5,8). The current direction is UP, and the body segments are [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. 

First, let's visualize the initial setup. The head is at (1,6), which is near the top-left of the grid. The apple is diagonally across towards the bottom-right, at (5,8). The body extends downwards from the head into row 1.

The snake can't reverse direction on its first move because it's currently moving UP. So the first move options are RIGHT or LEFT since it can't go DOWN immediately after UP unless allowed by rules.

Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,6). I need to check if this is safe:
- The new head is within bounds.
- The apple isn't in (2,6), so no collision with body except possibly at the tail. Since the body ends at (1,2), moving right doesn't conflict.

So RIGHT seems safe. Next move after that can't be LEFT because we just did a RIGHT. So next options are UP or maybe another RIGHT if possible.

After moving RIGHT once, let's plan the path step by step, ensuring each move keeps the snake from colliding with its body and avoids immediate trapping.

Each step must grow towards the apple without blocking itself. The Manhattan distance suggests needing 4 steps to the right and 2 up, but due to the grid and body constraints, it might take a longer route or zigzag.

I'll proceed safely, making sure each move doesn't cause a collision and leaves enough space for future moves.
</think>

The snake must navigate from (1,6) towards (5,8). The first safe move is RIGHT. Subsequent moves should be planned to avoid collisions with the body and leave room for further progress.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves right initially, then up, avoiding self-collisions. This path progresses towards the apple without immediate obstacles."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (1, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
