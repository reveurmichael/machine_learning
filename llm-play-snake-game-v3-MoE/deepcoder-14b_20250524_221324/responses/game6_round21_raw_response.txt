<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (7,9) to eat the apple at (7,7). Let me break this down step by step.

First, the current state: The head is at (7,9), which is the top-right corner of the grid. The direction is "UP", but wait, since the head is already at y=9, moving up would take it out of bounds, right? Because y can only go up to 9, so UP from (7,9) would be (7,10), which is invalid. So the snake can't move UP again; that's a boundary collision.

The body cells are [(7,8)], meaning the next segment after the head is at (7,8). The apple is two steps down from the head—since y decreases as we go down because higher y is up.

So the goal is to get the head to move down twice to reach (7,7), but I have to be careful about the body segments and not collide with them.

Wait, the current direction is UP. So if the snake was moving UP before, now it's at (7,9). But since moving UP from here would kill the snake, the next move can't be UP. The movement rules say that you can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN because that's reversing? Wait no—UP and DOWN are opposite vertical directions, but I think the rule says you can't choose the opposite of the current direction. So if the current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN next, and vice versa.

Wait, looking back: Rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly LEFT↔RIGHT. So since the current direction is UP, the next move cannot be DOWN. Wait no—wait, that's for when the current direction is something else. Wait no—the current direction is given as "UP", so the next move can't be "DOWN" because that would reverse.

Wait no: The rule says if current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next. So from UP, you cannot go DOWN; you can go LEFT or RIGHT, assuming they're allowed and don't cause collisions.

But wait, in this case, the head is at (7,9). If I try to move LEFT, that would take it to (6,9), which is possible if there's no collision. Similarly, moving RIGHT would be (8,9), but x can only go up to 9, so from x=7, moving right is allowed as long as the new head isn't out of bounds.

Wait, wait: The grid is from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. So y increases upwards, and x increases to the right. So (7,9) is the top row, x=7, y=9.

So possible moves:

- LEFT: (6,9)
- RIGHT: (8,9), but wait, x can be up to 9, so from 7, moving right once would take it to 8, which is within bounds.
- DOWN: (7,8) — but since the current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN next. Wait no—the rule says if current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN. So the next move cannot be DOWN.

Wait, wait no: The rule says that if the current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; same for LEFT and RIGHT. If current is NONE (like initial state), any first move is allowed.

So in this case, current direction is UP, so next move can't be DOWN.

Wait, but wait: The current direction is given as "UP". So the next move cannot be "DOWN", because that would reverse the vertical movement.

But wait, from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) is necessary to reach the apple. But since the current direction is UP, I can't choose DOWN as the next move. So what's the alternative?

Wait no: Wait, the rule says you cannot reverse direction on the first move if the current direction is NONE. But in this case, the current direction is UP, so any next move that's the opposite (DOWN) would be invalid.

Wait wait no, let me recheck: Rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for LEFT↔RIGHT. So if current direction is UP, next move can't be DOWN.

But in this case, the head is at (7,9), and to get down to (7,7), I need to make two moves: perhaps first move LEFT or RIGHT, then DOWN? Or maybe find another path.

Wait no, because from (7,9), if I can't move DOWN, what other options do I have?

Alternatively, perhaps the current direction being UP allows me to choose any non-DOWN direction except for the ones that would cause a collision. So possible next moves are LEFT or RIGHT, but then after that, I can change direction.

Wait, let's see:

Current head: (7,9), body is [(7,8)], apple at (7,7).

If I move LEFT to (6,9):

- New head would be (6,9). Check for collision: The body is currently at (7,8) behind the head. So new_head = (6,9). Is this colliding with any body cells except possibly the tail? The body after movement would have old head (7,9) added to the front of the body list.

Wait, no—after moving, the body is updated as follows:

1. Insert old head into the front of the body list.
2. If new_head == apple, grow; else, remove tail.

So in this case, after moving LEFT:

- The body was [(7,8)] (BODY1). After inserting old head (7,9) at front, it becomes [(7,9), (7,8)]. Then since new_head is (6,9) and apple is at (7,7), which is not equal to (6,9), so we remove the tail. The body after this move would be [(7,9)].

Wait no: Wait, initial body cells are given as [(7,8)], which is the segment immediately behind the head. So when you move LEFT, new_head is (6,9). Then:

- Insert old head (7,9) into front of body list → new body list becomes [ (7,9), (7,8) ].

But since we didn't eat an apple (new_head != apple position), we remove the last element (the tail), which is (7,8). So the new body after this move would be [ (7,9) ]? Wait no: Wait, the body list provided is [(7,8)], which is the body behind the head. After inserting old head at front, it's [(7,9), (7,8)]. Then since we didn't eat apple, remove tail (the last element, which is (7,8)), leaving only [(7,9)] as the new body.

Wait no: Wait, after moving, the full snake S becomes [new_head] + old_body. Or wait, according to movement update rule:

After step 3a and 3b:

- Insert old head at front of BODY → new BODY is [old_head] + current_BODY (which was [(7,8)]). So new body after insertion is [(7,9), (7,8)].

Then, if not eating apple, remove last element: so the body becomes [(7,9)]. But wait, no—because the initial body list in the input is [(7,8)], which represents BODY1 to BODYN. After inserting old head at front, it's [ (old_head), (BODY1), ... ].

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express:

Original state:

HEAD: (7,9)

BODY: [ (7,8) ]

So the full snake is [ (7,9), (7,8) ] — because the body list given is [(7,8)], which is BODY1.

After moving LEFT:

new_head = (6,9).

Then:

a. Insert old head (7,9) at front of BODY → new BODY becomes [ (7,9), (7,8) ].

b. Check if new_head == apple? No, because apple is at (7,7). So we proceed to remove the tail: the last element of the new body list is (7,8). Wait no—the body after inserting old head would be [ (7,9), (7,8) ], and since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the last element, which is (7,8). So the new body becomes [ (7,9) ].

Wait that can't be right because then the snake's length remains 2? Wait no: The initial snake has head + body of length 1 (since body list has one element). After moving, inserting old head makes the body have two elements, but if you don't eat apple, you remove the last element, so the body is back to [ (7,9) ], meaning the snake's total length is still 2: HEAD + body of 1.

Wait no: The initial state has a body list of [(7,8)], which represents the segments behind the head. So the full snake is [HEAD (7,9), BODY1 (7,8)]. After moving LEFT:

- new_head = (6,9).

Then step 3a: Insert old head into front → BODY becomes [ (7,9), (7,8) ].

Step 3c: Since new_head != apple, remove last element (the tail) which is (7,8). So the new body list after this move would be [ (7,9) ], meaning the full snake is:

HEAD = (6,9)

BODY = [ (7,9) ]

Wait that doesn't make sense. Because the old head was at (7,9), and the new head is at (6,9). The body after inserting old head would be [ (7,9), (7,8) ], but then we remove the last element (the original tail at (7,8)), so the body becomes [ (7,9) ].

So the full snake is:

HEAD: (6,9)

BODY: [ (7,9) ]

Wait that seems like a problem because (7,9) is adjacent to the new head at (6,9). So moving LEFT would cause the head to be at (6,9), and the body now has (7,9) as the next segment. But wait, that would mean the head is at (6,9), and the next segment is (7,9), which is adjacent but not overlapping.

Wait no—wait, after moving LEFT, the new head is (6,9). The old head was (7,9), which is now part of the body. So the body would be [ (7,9) ], so the full snake is:

(6,9) -> (7,9)

Because the body list after this move is [ (7,9) ].

Wait no—wait: The body list after inserting old head and then removing tail would be [ (7,9), (7,8) ] before removal. Then we remove the last element (7,8), so body becomes [ (7,9) ], meaning the full snake is:

HEAD: (6,9)

BODY: [ (7,9) ]

Wait that can't be right because then the segment at (7,9) would be directly behind the head at (6,9). But (7,9) is to the right of (6,9), so the snake's body would have a kink.

But in any case, collision-wise, we need to check if new_head (6,9) collides with any body segments except possibly the tail. The body after this move would be [ (7,9) ], which is one segment behind the head at (6,9). So no collision because (6,9) and (7,9) are adjacent but not overlapping.

Wait, but wait: When you insert the old head into the front of the body list, the new body becomes [old_head] + current_body. Then if you didn't eat an apple, you remove the last element.

So initial body is [(7,8)]. After inserting old head (7,9) at front, it's [ (7,9), (7,8) ]. Since we didn't eat the apple, we remove the last element: (7,8). So new body is [ (7,9) ].

So after moving LEFT:

HEAD = (6,9)

BODY = [ (7,9) ]

Wait, that's a bit strange because now the head is at (6,9), and the next segment is at (7,9), which would be adjacent but not overlapping. So no collision occurs here.

But then, after this move, the direction changes to LEFT? Or does it stay as whatever we chose?

Wait, movement direction is determined by the move you make. If I choose LEFT, then the new current direction becomes LEFT.

So from (6,9), with current direction LEFT, what can I do next?

But maybe that's complicating things. Let me think about possible paths to reach the apple at (7,7).

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of moving down directly, which is blocked by the current direction restriction, find another way.

Wait no—current direction is UP, so next move cannot be DOWN. So from (7,9), I can't go DOWN, but perhaps I can make a U-turn later.

Alternatively, maybe the first move should be RIGHT or LEFT to change position and then proceed downward.

But wait, if I move RIGHT to (8,9), that's possible as long as it doesn't cause collision. The body is at (7,8). So new head would be (8,9).

Check for collisions: new_head = (8,9). Body after this move would have old head (7,9) inserted at front, making the body [ (7,9), (7,8) ]. Then since we didn't eat apple, remove last element (7,8), leaving body as [ (7,9) ].

So full snake: HEAD (8,9), BODY [ (7,9) ]

No collision here because (8,9) and (7,9) are adjacent but not overlapping.

Then next move can be DOWN, since the current direction after moving RIGHT would now be RIGHT. Wait no—wait, if I moved RIGHT, then the new current direction is RIGHT, so next move cannot be LEFT.

Wait no: The rule says you can't reverse the previous direction. So if I was going UP before and now I'm going RIGHT, what's the restriction? Wait no—the rule applies to when the current direction is something; it doesn't track previous directions beyond that.

Wait no: Rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly LEFT↔RIGHT. So if your current direction is RIGHT, then you can't choose LEFT next, but you could choose UP or DOWN unless they are blocked by boundaries or collisions.

So after moving RIGHT to (8,9), the new current direction would be RIGHT. Then I couldn't move LEFT next, but maybe I could move DOWN towards the apple.

Wait, but from (8,9), moving DOWN would take me to (8,8). Let's see:

After moving RIGHT to (8,9):

- New head: (8,9)

- Body after inserting old head (7,9) and removing tail (since no apple eaten): [ (7,9) ]

So full snake is [ (8,9), (7,9) ].

Now, can I move DOWN from (8,9)?

Yes, because moving down would be to (8,8). But wait, the current direction is RIGHT. So can't choose LEFT next, but can I choose DOWN?

Wait no—current direction is RIGHT, so you cannot choose LEFT. You could choose UP or DOWN, provided they don't reverse any previous directions. Wait no—the rule only prevents choosing the exact opposite of the current direction.

So if current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT; it can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (if possible). So from (8,9), moving DOWN to (8,8) would be allowed as long as there's no collision.

Wait, but after moving down, let's see:

new_head = (8,8)

Body after inserting old head (8,9):

- Insert (8,9) at front of current body [ (7,9) ] → new body becomes [ (8,9), (7,9) ]

Then since new_head != apple (which is at 7,7), remove last element: which would be (7,9).

So the new body after this move would be [ (8,9) ]

Wait no: The initial body after moving RIGHT was [ (7,9) ]. After inserting old head (8,9), it becomes [ (8,9), (7,9) ], and then since we didn't eat apple, remove last element, which is (7,9). So the new body is [ (8,9) ].

So after moving DOWN from (8,9):

- HEAD: (8,8)

- BODY: [ (8,9) ]

No collision here because (8,8) and (8,9) are adjacent vertically; but wait, that would mean the next segment is directly above the head. That's okay as long as they don't overlap.

Wait no—overlap is when new_head is same position as any body cell except possibly the tail before the move. Wait no: The collision check is whether new_head is in the current body (excluding the tail if it's about to be removed). Wait, no—the collision check is whether new_head is in any of the body cells except possibly the one that would be removed when you don't eat an apple.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline possible moves:

Option 1: Move LEFT from (7,9) → (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN if possible, but current direction after LEFT is now LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT? Wait no—the rule says you can't choose the opposite of the current direction. If current direction is LEFT, then next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait no: Rule 2 says:

"If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT↔RIGHT."

So if current direction is LEFT, then next move can't be RIGHT.

But from (6,9), after moving LEFT, current direction is LEFT. So next moves cannot be RIGHT. But perhaps I could move DOWN or UP, but since we're at y=9, UP would take us out of bounds.

Wait no—from (6,9), moving UP would be to (6,10), which is invalid. So only possible moves are LEFT (but x can't go below 0) and DOWN and RIGHT if not blocked by direction rules.

Wait, from (6,9):

- Current direction: LEFT (since we moved LEFT).

So next move cannot be RIGHT.

Possible moves:

- LEFT again to (5,9), but only if x >=1.

- DOWN to (6,8). Let's see if that's possible.

After moving DOWN from (6,9) to (6,8):

Check collision: new_head is (6,8).

The body after inserting old head (6,9) into current body [ (7,9) ] would be:

Wait no—wait, initial move was LEFT from (7,9) → (6,9). After that move, the body was [ (7,9) ].

Then moving DOWN from (6,9):

- Insert old head (6,9) into front of current body [ (7,9) ] → new body becomes [ (6,9), (7,9) ]

Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element: (7,9). So new body is [ (6,9) ].

So full snake:

HEAD: (6,8)

BODY: [ (6,9) ]

No collision since (6,8) and (6,9) are adjacent vertically; but wait, no—new head is at (6,8), and the body is now at (6,9). So they're directly above each other. Is that allowed? I think so as long as they don't occupy the same cell.

Wait no—the snake's body can't overlap with itself except for the tail when growing. But in this case, moving down from (6,9) to (6,8), and the body now includes (6,9). So new_head is at (6,8), and the next segment is at (6,9)—no collision because they're different cells.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps it's better to find a way to reach the apple without immediate conflicts. Maybe moving in a figure-eight or some other pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the first move should be DOWN if possible, but since current direction is UP (from initial position), we can't move DOWN immediately. So maybe make a U-turn by moving RIGHT or LEFT first, then proceed downward.

Wait no—current direction is UP, so next move cannot be DOWN.

So from initial position (7,9):

- Current direction: UP (assuming that's how it starts).

Wait wait, I'm assuming the snake starts at (7,9) facing UP. But maybe the starting direction isn't specified. Wait, no—the problem statement doesn't specify the initial direction, so perhaps we can choose any initial move.

But wait, in the initial position, if the snake is at (7,9), and it's possible to move in any direction except where blocked by walls or itself.

Wait no—walls aren't mentioned, but assuming it's on an infinite grid without walls except for boundaries. Wait no—if x or y go below 0 or beyond some limit, perhaps the game ends, but the problem doesn't specify that. So we can assume movement is possible in any direction as long as there's no self-collision.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me outline a possible path:

1. From (7,9), move RIGHT to (8,9). Current direction: RIGHT.

2. Now, from (8,9), can't move LEFT next due to rule 2 (since current direction is RIGHT).

3. Next, move DOWN to (8,8). Check for collision: new_head (8,8) vs body [ (7,9) ] → no collision.

4. Current direction now: DOWN.

5. From (8,8), can't move UP next.

6. Move LEFT to (7,8). Check collision: new_head (7,8) vs body [ (8,9), (7,9) ] after inserting old head (8,8).

Wait no—let me track the body properly:

After step 1: moved RIGHT to (8,9). Body becomes [ (7,9) ].

Step 2: move DOWN to (8,8). Insert (8,9) at front → body becomes [ (8,9), (7,9) ], then remove last element since no apple eaten → body is [ (8,9) ].

Wait that can't be right. Wait no:

When you move from (8,9) to (8,8):

- Insert the old head (8,9) at front of current body [ (7,9) ] → new body becomes [ (8,9), (7,9) ]

Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element: which is (7,9). So new body is [ (8,9) ].

Wait no—that doesn't seem right. The old head was at (8,9), and the move to (8,8) would have the body consisting of the previous segments plus the old head.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body updates. Let me clarify:

When you move the head in a new direction, the body follows by adding the old head position as the next segment, then removing the last segment unless you eat an apple (which isn't the case here).

So initial position: HEAD at (7,9), BODY empty or perhaps with some segments if it's longer.

Wait no—the problem doesn't specify the snake's length. Let me assume the snake is of length 1 for this problem, meaning it only has a head and no body. But that can't be because otherwise, moving wouldn't have any consequences except changing position.

Wait wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the movement mechanics. Maybe in this context, the snake can move freely without worrying about its own body blocking itself, but that's unlikely. So perhaps the key is to find a path where the head can reach (7,7) without colliding with itself, considering the direction constraints.

Alternatively, maybe there's no possible way due to the initial restrictions, but I don't think so.

Wait another idea: Maybe after moving in one direction, you can change direction in such a way that allows you to move down later.

But perhaps it's easier to just outline step-by-step moves:

1. Start at (7,9), facing UP (assuming initial direction is UP).

2. Move RIGHT to (8,9). Now current direction is RIGHT; next cannot be LEFT.

3. From (8,9), move DOWN to (8,8). Current direction is DOWN; next cannot be UP.

4. From (8,8), move LEFT to (7,8). Current direction is LEFT; next cannot be RIGHT.

5. From (7,8), move DOWN to (7,7). Now reached the apple at (7,7).

Wait but wait: After step 4, when moving from (8,8) to (7,8):

- Insert old head (8,8) into body. Wait no—the body is just following the head's movement.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating the body tracking. Perhaps for this problem, we can ignore the body and focus on whether the path exists without considering self-collisions, but that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can make a U-turn by moving in a square pattern.

But given the initial restriction of not being able to move DOWN from (7,9) because current direction is UP, maybe the first move has to be something else.

Wait no—current direction could be any direction if it's the first move. Wait, actually, the initial direction might not be specified. So perhaps I can choose any initial direction, including RIGHT or LEFT, to avoid the restriction of not being able to move DOWN immediately.

Wait wait, but in the initial position, if the snake is at (7,9) and facing UP, then moving DOWN would be impossible because it's blocked by its own head? No, that's not necessarily true. The grid is likely infinite, so you can move in any direction unless blocked by walls or yourself.

Wait no—if the snake is at (7,9), and it's length 1, then it can move in any direction except where its body would collide with itself. But if it's longer than that, the body might block certain moves.

But perhaps for simplicity, let's assume the snake can adjust its path to avoid self-collisions by making appropriate turns.

So a possible path could be:

1. Move RIGHT from (7,9) → (8,9)

2. Move DOWN from (8,9) → (8,8)

3. Move LEFT from (8,8) → (7,8)

4. Move DOWN from (7,8) → (7,7)

This way, the head reaches (7,7) without immediate self-collisions.

But wait, after step 1: moving RIGHT to (8,9), body is now [ (7,9) ]

Step 2: move DOWN to (8,8). Insert old head (8,9) at front → body becomes [ (8,9), (7,9) ], then remove last element (since no apple eaten) → body is [ (8,9) ]

Wait that doesn't make sense. The body should follow the movement.

Alternatively, perhaps each move adds a new head position and removes the tail unless growing.

But I'm getting stuck on the specifics of how the snake's body updates. Maybe for this problem, it's sufficient to say that the path exists by making these moves:

RIGHT → DOWN → LEFT → DOWN

Which would take the head from (7,9) → (8,9) → (8,8) → (7,8) → (7,7)

So yes, the snake can reach the apple at (7,7) without being blocked by its own body or movement restrictions.

Therefore, the answer is that it's possible.
</think>

The snake can navigate to the target position by making a series of moves that avoid self-collisions and adhere to movement constraints. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at position (7,9). Assume it can face any initial direction; for this path, we'll choose RIGHT.

2. **Move Right**: The snake moves from (7,9) to (8,9). Now facing RIGHT, the next move cannot be LEFT.

3. **Move Down**: From (8,9), the snake turns DOWN and moves to (8,8). Facing DOWN now, it can't move UP next.

4. **Move Left**: Turning LEFT from (8,8), the snake moves to (7,8). Now facing LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT.

5. **Move Down Again**: Finally, the snake turns DOWN and moves from (7,8) to (7,7), reaching the target.

This path ensures no self-collisions and complies with movement restrictions.

**Answer:** The snake can reach the target by following the moves RIGHT → DOWN → LEFT → DOWN. Therefore, it is possible.

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
