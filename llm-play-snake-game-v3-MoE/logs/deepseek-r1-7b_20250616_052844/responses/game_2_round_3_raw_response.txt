========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to help this snake reach the apple safely. The snake's head is at (3,3), and the apple is at (3,2). So, it needs to move left towards the apple. 

First, I need to check if moving left directly would cause any issues. Since the snake has a body that might block its path, I should make sure there's space for the head to move without colliding with anything.

Looking at the current setup, the snake's body is given as an empty list. That means it's just the head segment; no body segments are blocking the way yet. So, moving left from (3,3) would take it to (2,3), which is currently unoccupied because there are no body parts beyond the head.

But wait, after moving, I have to consider how the snake updates its body. When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat the apple, the tail gets removed, and a new segment is added at the front. However, in this case, since we're just moving left towards the apple, which isn't on (3,2), the body won't grow.

Now, I should think about whether moving left would cause any future issues. Since there's no other snake segments beyond the head right now, as long as the new head position is within bounds and not overlapping with the tail or any existing body parts. The head moving to (2,3) seems safe because it doesn't coincide with anything else.

Also, according to the movement rules, after each move, the snake's body is updated by inserting the old head at the front and removing the tail unless it ate the apple. Since we're not eating the apple here, the tail gets removed. But since there are no other body segments beyond the head, this shouldn't cause any issues.

Another thing to consider is direction reversal. The current direction isn't specified because the snake hasn't moved yet; perhaps I can choose a safe initial direction without worrying about reversing in the first move. Since moving left directly towards the apple is possible and doesn't involve any immediate risks, that seems like a good starting point.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Move left from (3,3) to (2,3).
2. Check for collisions: The new head position isn't outside the grid or overlapping with any body parts.
3. Update the snake's body by adding the old head at the front and removing the tail if not eating the apple.

Since all these steps seem safe, moving left should be a valid first move towards reaching the apple without any immediate issues.

The snake can safely move left to start moving towards the apple without colliding with its own body or getting trapped. Each subsequent move will continue this direction until it reaches the apple.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving left twice brings the head from (3,3) to (1,3), then further towards the apple at (3,2). The body remains unobstructed as there are no other segments in this short path."
}
```
