{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 5 units right (from x=3 to x=8) and 1 unit down (from y=8 to y=7). Starting with the current direction 'UP', the first valid moves are RIGHT (avoiding reversal). Moving RIGHT five times brings the head to (8,8). The next move DOWN reaches the apple at (8,7). Each step avoids collisions with the body, and after eating the apple, there are safe moves available (e.g., LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN).",
