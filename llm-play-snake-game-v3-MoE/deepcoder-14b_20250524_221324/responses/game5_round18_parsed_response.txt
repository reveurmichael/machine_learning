{"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT"], "reasoning": "To move from (4,5) to (8,8), we need to increase x-coordinate by 4 and y-coordinate by 3. Since each move changes one coordinate at a time, the total number of steps required is their sum. Therefore, we can achieve this with 7 moves: moving right four times and up three times in some order."}
