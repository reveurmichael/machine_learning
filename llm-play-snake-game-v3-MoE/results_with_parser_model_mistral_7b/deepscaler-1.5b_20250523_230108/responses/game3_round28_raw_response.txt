========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a snake in the classic Snake game on a 10x10 grid. The head is at (6,5), and the apple is at (7,4). We need to plan a path for the snake's head to reach the apple safely.

First, let's understand the given information:

- **Snake representation**: The body cells are given as [(6,6), (6,7)]. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the provided Body cells list excludes the head and goes from BODY1 to Tail. So the snake's full S is [Head, Body1, Body2, ..., Tail]. But here, the body cells are given as [(6,6), (6,7)], which might be Body1 and Body2. Wait, but wait—the head is at (6,5). So perhaps the body starts from the segment behind the head.

Wait, let's think again: The snake's full S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN]. Each BODYi is adjacent to its predecessor. The given Body cells list is ordered from BODY1 to Tail. So in this case, the provided Body cells are [(6,6), (6,7)]. That means BODY1 is at (6,6) and Body2 is at (6,7). But wait, that's only two segments. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, maybe the head is given as (6,5), which is the first element of the body cells list? Or is it part of the snake's structure?

No, according to the problem statement: The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN]. Each Bodyi is adjacent to its predecessor. The provided Body cells list is [(6,6), (6,7)], which are from BODY1 to Tail. So perhaps the head is at (6,5), and the body starts with (6,6) as BODY1.

But wait, that might not make sense because moving from (6,5) to (6,6) would require a move in the DOWN direction if the snake's head is moving down. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the initial state of the snake.

Wait, maybe the given Body cells list includes all the body parts except the head. So for example, if the head is at (6,5), then the first body part is the segment behind it. But in this case, the given Body cells are [(6,6), (6,7)], which might indicate that BODY1 is at (6,6) and Body2 at (6,7). So perhaps the snake's body starts from (6,6) as the first body part.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to approach this step by step.

First, let's note the given data:

- Head position: (6,5)
- Current direction: "DOWN"
- Body cells: [(6,6), (6,7)] → So perhaps these are the positions of the snake's body segments from behind the head. Wait, but if the head is at (6,5) and the first body cell is (6,6), that would mean the segment behind the head is at (6,6). But since the snake starts with the head, then comes the first body part.

Wait, perhaps the given Body cells list is from BODY1 to Tail. So if the head is at (6,5), and the first body cell is (6,6), that might be a problem because moving down from (6,5) would go to (7,5), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the given Body cells list is [(6,6), (6,7)], which are consecutive positions. So perhaps these are two body segments: one behind and another in front? Not sure yet.

The apple position is (7,4). The head is at (6,5) after moving some steps. We need to plan the path so that the snake's head moves from (6,5) towards (7,4), avoiding collisions and eating the apple if possible.

Given the movement rules:

1. Compute new_head based on direction.
2. Check for collisions with grid bounds or existing body cells except tail when moving.
3. Update body positions accordingly.
4. After eating, ensure there's at least one legal move next turn.

Also, the snake cannot reverse direction on the first move unless it's "NONE".

Let's start by determining the initial state:

- Head is at (6,5).
- Direction is "DOWN".
- Body cells are [(6,6), (6,7)] → So perhaps these are the positions of BODY1 and BODY2. Wait, but if the head is at (6,5), then the first body part would be the segment behind it. So perhaps the given Body cells list starts from the segment immediately behind the head.

So if the head is at (6,5), the previous position would be (6,4) or something else? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding this.

Alternatively, perhaps the given Body cells list is [(6,6), (6,7)], which are consecutive positions. So perhaps these are two body segments: one in front of the head and another further ahead. But since the snake's full S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2], then maybe the initial direction is "DOWN", so the first move would be to move down.

But wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the given Body cells list is from the segment immediately behind the head (BODY1) up to the tail. So if the head is at (6,5), and the body starts with (6,6), then moving DOWN once would take the head to (7,5). But perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Let's try to proceed step by step:

1. The snake's current position: Head at (6,5).
2. Direction is "DOWN".
3. Body cells are [(6,6), (6,7)] → So perhaps these are the positions of the body segments from the segment behind the head up to the tail. But if the head is at (6,5), then the previous position would be (6,4) or something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the given Body cells list starts from the segment immediately behind the head. So if the head is at (6,5), then the first body segment (BODY1) would be at (6,4), but in this case, it's given as (6,6). Hmm, perhaps this indicates a different starting point.

Alternatively, maybe the given Body cells list includes all body parts except the head. So if the snake has more than one body part, then perhaps we need to consider that.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to focus on the movement rules and the problem at hand.

We need to move from (6,5) towards (7,4). The apple is at (7,4), which is diagonally down-right from the head.

Since the direction is "DOWN", perhaps moving straight down would take us closer. But we need to avoid collisions.

Also, considering that after eating the apple, there must be a legal move next turn, meaning we can't get stuck immediately.

Let's outline possible steps:

1. Determine the movement direction: Since it's currently "DOWN", and assuming no immediate reversal (as per rule 1), the next move would be to stay in the same column but increase row by 1.

2. Compute new_head as (6+1,5) = (7,5).

3. Check if this position is outside grid bounds: x=7 < 10, y=5 <9. So it's within bounds.

4. Now, check for collisions. Since the snake's head is at (7,5), we need to ensure that none of the body segments are here except possibly the tail.

But wait, perhaps after moving, the new_head should not coincide with any existing body parts except the tail when moving.

In this case, the current body segments are [(6,6), (6,7)], but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the given Body cells list is from the segment immediately behind the head up to the tail. So if the head is at (6,5), and the first body part is (6,6), then the previous position would be (6,5) minus direction. Since direction is DOWN, moving down would take us to a higher y-coordinate. So perhaps this indicates that the initial movement is DOWN, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to focus on the problem: We need to move from (6,5) towards (7,4). Given that the head needs to reach (7,4), and considering the direction is "DOWN", perhaps we can plan a path that moves down as much as possible first.

But let's consider the given Body cells. Since they are [(6,6), (6,7)], perhaps these are two body segments behind the head? Wait, but if the head is at (6,5), then moving DOWN once would take us to (7,5). But perhaps I'm not considering all possible positions.

Alternatively, perhaps we should consider that the snake's current state includes the head and the initial body parts. So maybe after moving, we can proceed step by step.

Let me try to outline a possible path:

- Current position: (6,5), direction DOWN.
- Next move: Move DOWN to (7,5).
- Check if this is safe: Is (7,5) occupied by any body part except the tail? If not, then proceed.

But perhaps I'm missing something. Let's try to think differently.

Given that the apple is at (7,4), which is one step right and two steps down from the head at (6,5). Wait, no: from (6,5) to (7,4) would require moving RIGHT once and DOWN once, but perhaps more accurately.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible moves:

Since direction is DOWN, let's see if moving DOWN would take us closer to the apple or avoid immediate collisions.

If we move DOWN once from (6,5), new_head is (7,5). Now, check for collision: Are any body parts at (7,5)? If not, proceed. Otherwise, perhaps need to adjust direction or find another path.

But perhaps given that the initial direction is DOWN and the body cells are [(6,6), (6,7)], maybe these represent the positions of BODY1 and BODY2 as they were before moving. So perhaps when we move DOWN once from (6,5) to (7,5), this new position isn't part of any body segment except possibly the tail.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step:

1. Current position: (6,5)
2. Direction: DOWN
3. Move to (7,5). Now check if this is a valid move:
   - Is (7,5) within grid? Yes.
   - Are any body parts at (7,5)? If not, proceed.

But perhaps the given Body cells are [(6,6), (6,7)], which may indicate that these positions are part of the snake's body except for the head. So perhaps moving from (6,5) to (7,5) is possible if it doesn't collide with any existing body parts.

Assuming this is valid, then proceed.

After eating the apple at (7,4), we need to ensure that there's a legal move next turn.

But perhaps let's try to see what path would lead us from (6,5) towards (7,4).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about possible steps:

Since direction is DOWN, and considering the movement rules:

From (6,5), moving DOWN once gets to (7,5). Now, check if any body part is at (7,5): If not, proceed.

But in this case, since we haven't moved yet, perhaps it's safe. Then, after that move, we need to see where the snake goes next.

Alternatively, perhaps let's think about what happens when moving from (6,5) with direction DOWN:

- Move to (7,5), then check for collisions.
   - If no body parts are at (7,5), proceed.
   - Else, adjust direction or find another path.

But perhaps given that the problem allows us to choose any path as long as it's safe and reaches the apple, let's try to plan a possible sequence of moves.

Another approach: Since we need to reach (7,4), which is one row down and one column right from (6,5). Wait, no. From (6,5) to (7,4): x increases by 1, y decreases by 1. So perhaps a diagonal move isn't possible with the given direction.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN once and RIGHT once would take us closer.

But let's try to outline steps:

Step 1: Start at (6,5), direction DOWN.
Step 2: Move DOWN to (7,5). Check collision: since no body parts are here except if any of the segments are present. But perhaps this is safe.
Now, check for collisions when moving from (7,5) towards apple.

But perhaps it's better to consider that after each move, we need to ensure that new_head is not overlapping with any existing body parts except possibly the tail.

In our case, since we're starting at (6,5), direction DOWN, and the Body cells are [(6,6), (6,7)], perhaps moving to (7,5) is possible if it's not part of any body segments. Then, after that, proceed towards the apple.

But perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let's try a different approach: since we need to move from (6,5) towards (7,4), and given the direction is DOWN, let's consider moving once more:

From (7,5), moving DOWN would take us to (8,5). But perhaps that might be beyond our target.

Alternatively, perhaps after reaching (7,5), we can move RIGHT once to reach (7,6) or something else. But perhaps this is not necessary yet.

But let's think about the initial steps:

1. From (6,5), direction DOWN.
2. Move to (7,5). Now check for collisions: are any body parts at (7,5)? If none, proceed.

Assuming that moving to (7,5) doesn't cause a collision with existing body segments (which are [(6,6), (6,7)]), then this move is possible.

Now, after reaching (7,5), perhaps the next step would be to check if any further movement is possible without causing collisions or getting stuck immediately.

But perhaps since we need to reach the apple at (7,4), let's think of moving from (7,5) to (7,4). But that requires moving LEFT once. However, given our current direction, perhaps it's better to adjust direction first.

Alternatively, perhaps after reaching (7,5), if there are no more body parts except the tail, then we can proceed towards the apple.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to outline a possible path:

- Move DOWN once from (6,5) to (7,5).
- Then check for collision: since none of the current body segments are at (7,5), proceed.
- Now, after moving, we need to see if any further movement is safe.

But perhaps given that we have moved down, and considering the apple's position, maybe it's better to move DOWN again or adjust direction.

Alternatively, perhaps let's consider that once we reach (6,4) as part of our body segments, then we can proceed towards the apple.

But perhaps this is getting too time-consuming. Let me try a different approach: since we need to get from (6,5) to (7,4), and considering movement rules, let's outline possible steps:

1. From (6,5), direction DOWN.
2. Move to (7,5). Check for collisions: not in any body segment except if there are existing parts at this position.
   - Since initial body segments are [(6,6), (6,7)], moving to (7,5) is safe as none of these positions match.
3. Now, after moving to (7,5), check for possible movement towards the apple.

But perhaps from (7,5), we need to move towards (7,4). Since direction is DOWN, perhaps adjusting it would help.

Alternatively, perhaps let's consider that after reaching (6,4) as part of our body segments, then moving further down could be possible.

Wait, perhaps this problem requires a more structured approach. Let me try to outline all the steps:

1. Initial state:
   - Head position: (6,5)
   - Current direction: DOWN
   - Body cells: [(6,6), (6,7)] → These are positions of the snake's body segments from the segment behind the head up to the tail.

2. The goal is to move towards (7,4).

3. We need to determine if it's possible to reach this position without colliding with existing body parts or getting stuck immediately after moving.

Given that, perhaps let's outline possible steps:

Step 1: Move DOWN from (6,5) to (7,5).
- Check if this is safe.
   - Current body segments are [(6,6), (6,7)] → Neither of these positions equals (7,5). So proceed.

Now, after moving to (7,5):

Step 2: Check for possible movement towards the apple.

We need to move closer to (7,4).

Possible direction adjustments:
- If we can adjust direction, perhaps it's better. But since the current direction is DOWN, perhaps we need to change it.

But according to rule 1, if the next step would be "NONE", then we cannot reverse direction.

Wait, perhaps let me think again about the possible moves after moving to (7,5).

From (7,5), what are the possible directions? Since the current direction is DOWN, but perhaps we can adjust it to move towards the apple.

But wait, perhaps considering that moving DOWN from (7,5) would take us further away from the apple at (7,4). So maybe it's better to change direction to RIGHT or LEFT.

Alternatively, perhaps let's consider that after reaching (7,5), we can adjust our movement.

But this is getting too tangled. Let me try to outline possible moves step by step:

From (6,5) → DOWN → (7,5). Check collision: no body parts at this position.

Now, from (7,5):

- Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.
   - Moving LEFT would take us to (7,4), which is the apple's position. But perhaps it's better to check if moving LEFT is possible without causing collisions or getting stuck.

So let's try moving LEFT once from (7,5) → (7,4).

Check collision: any body parts at (7,4)?
If none of the current body segments are here except possibly the tail.

Assuming that after moving to (7,5), we haven't added this position as part of our body segments yet. So perhaps it's safe.

Now, check if there is a legal move next turn after eating the apple:

After moving to (7,4):

- The new head would be at (7,4).
   - Now, we need to ensure that when we compute the new_head as per direction, none of the existing body parts except possibly the tail are present.

Assuming that in our current body segments, perhaps (6,6), (6,7) remain unless they were added by us during movement.

But since we've moved from (6,5) to (7,5), and then to (7,4), perhaps these positions have been updated as part of our own movements.

Therefore, after reaching (7,4), the new_head is at (7,4). Now, compute the next possible moves:

- Current direction: let's assume we're moving DOWN again. So from (7,4) → (8,4).
   - Check collision with any body parts except the tail.
     - If none are present, proceed.

But perhaps since our goal is to reach (7,4), and after that, any further movement would be unnecessary unless required for safety.

Therefore, perhaps this path is feasible: move DOWN once from (6,5) → (7,5). Then, move LEFT once → (7,4).

In terms of steps:

1. Move DOWN from (6,5) to (7,5).
2. Move LEFT from (7,5) to (7,4).

This seems to reach the apple's position without any collisions or immediate stuck.

Therefore, the possible sequence is:

- First move: DOWN
- Second move: LEFT

But let me double-check for any potential collisions.

After moving down to (7,5):

Is there a body part at this position? The initial body segments are [(6,6), (6,7)], which don't include (7,5). So that's safe.

Then, moving left from (7,5) → (7,4). Again, no body parts at (7,4), so it's safe.

Therefore, this path seems valid.
</think>

The solution involves moving the snake down once and then left once to reach the apple. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Start at position (6,5) facing DOWN.
2. Move DOWN to (7,5). Check for collisions; none found.
3. From (7,5), move LEFT to (7,4). Again, no collision.

Thus, the snake reaches the apple's position in two moves: one DOWN and then one LEFT.

$\boxed{\text{Down, Then Left}}$
