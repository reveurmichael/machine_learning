========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (7,1) to eat the apple at (9,8). 

First, I'll look at the current state. The head is at (7,1), and the body cells are [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]. So the snake is a long line from (1,2) down to (7,1). The direction is RIGHT, so the next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse. 

The apple is at (9,8), which is far up and to the right. The Manhattan distance is |9-7| + |8-1| = 2 +7=9 steps. But since we have to make sure not to reverse direction, I need to plan a safe path without colliding with the body.

The head is moving RIGHT, so from (7,1) it can go further right to (8,1), but that might lead towards the apple. However, looking at the body cells, all the positions from (1,2) down are in a line, so as the snake moves, the tail will either stay or grow.

I think the first move should be RIGHT because that's the current direction and we can't reverse. So moving to (8,1). But wait, after that, I need to make sure the next moves don't hit the body. The body is behind in columns 0-6 along y=1, so as long as we're moving right or up, we should avoid those.

But if I move RIGHT again, then the head would be at (9,1), which is two steps to the right of the apple's x-coordinate. From there, I can start moving UP towards 8 on the y-axis. But wait, from (9,1), moving up multiple times might take me into positions that could collide with the body as it moves.

Alternatively, maybe after a few RIGHTs, we can start going UP without hitting any part of the body. Let's see:

Current head: (7,1)
Body cells: [(6,1) is the last before the head? Wait no—the body list includes (6,1), which is just behind the head at (7,1). So moving to (8,1) would make the new head there, and the old head (7,1) becomes part of the body. Then, the next move can't be LEFT because that's reversing.

Wait no: The movement rules say you cannot reverse direction. Current direction is RIGHT, so you can't go LEFT on the first move. So after moving RIGHT to (8,1), the next move could be RIGHT again to (9,1). Then from there, I need to start moving UP towards 8.

But let's check if that path is safe:

After moving to (8,1), body includes (7,1) and previous cells. So when moving to (8,1), the next step can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction. So after (8,1), move RIGHT again to (9,1). Now, at (9,1), I need to start moving UP.

But wait, from (9,1) moving up is possible as long as it doesn't hit any body cells. The body now includes all the previous positions except the head, which is now (9,1). So when moving up from (9,1), each step adds a new position to the head and shifts the body.

Wait, but after eating the apple, the tail remains, so we have more segments. But before that, each move shifts the body without adding a segment unless an apple is eaten.

Hmm, this might get complicated. Let me try to outline possible moves:

1. Move RIGHT to (8,1)
2. Move RIGHT again to (9,1)
3. Then start moving UP multiple times towards y=8.

But let's think about the body after each move:

After first move: head is at (8,1), body includes (7,1) and previous cells except (6,1). Wait no—the body list given is all positions excluding the head, so when we move, the new position becomes the head, and the old head becomes part of the body. So after moving RIGHT once:

New head: (8,1)
Body now includes (7,1) plus the rest [(6,1), (5,1)... up to (0,2)].

Wait no—the initial body is a list that doesn't include the head. So when the head moves, the new position is added as the head, and all other positions shift by adding the direction vector except for the tail if not eating.

But this is getting too detailed. Maybe it's better to plan step by step:

Current head: (7,1), body cells up to (6,1). Direction is RIGHT.

First move: RIGHT to (8,1). Now, the new head is at (8,1). The body becomes [(7,1), (6,1), ..., (0,2)].

Second move: Can't reverse direction, so next move can be RIGHT again to (9,1). Now head is at (9,1), body includes (8,1) plus others.

Third move: Now we need to go UP. From (9,1) moving UP to (9,2). But does that hit any body cells? The body now includes (8,1), (7,1), etc., which are at x=0-8, y=1 or 2. So at (9,2), no collision.

Fourth move: UP to (9,3).

Fifth move: UP to (9,4).

Sixth move: UP to (9,5).

Seventh move: UP to (9,6).

Eighth move: UP to (9,7).

Ninth move: UP to (9,8), which is the apple.

Wait, but after each UP move, does the body shift? Let me count the steps:

From (7,1):

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,1). Body now includes (7,1) and all previous cells except head.

Move 2: RIGHT → (9,1). Body includes (8,1), (7,1), etc.

Then starting to move UP:

Move 3: UP → (9,2)

Now body is [(9,1), (8,1), (7,1), ...]. So when moving UP, the new head is at (9,2). The previous head (9,1) becomes part of the body.

But wait, after each move, the snake's body shifts: the head becomes the next segment, and the tail moves unless an apple is eaten. Since we haven't eaten the apple yet, each UP move adds a new head and removes the tail.

So as long as when moving UP from (9,1), the position (9,2) isn't in the body after that move. Let's check:

After second move: head at (9,1). Body is [(8,1), (7,1), ..., (0,2)].

When moving to (9,2):

New head is (9,2). The previous head (9,1) becomes part of the body. So now the body includes all previous cells plus (9,1).

Wait no—the body list in the initial state is without the head. After each move, the new head is added to the front, and if not eating an apple, the last cell is removed.

So, after first move:

Head: (8,1)

Body: [(7,1), (6,1), ..., (0,2)]

After second move:

Head: (9,1)

Body: [(8,1), (7,1), ..., (0,2)] (assuming tail was removed because no apple eaten yet).

Wait, but after moving to (9,1), the body is now [(8,1), (7,1), ...]. So when moving UP from (9,1) to (9,2):

New head: (9,2)

Body becomes [(9,1), (8,1), (7,1), ...] but the tail at (0,2) is removed because we didn't eat an apple. Wait no—the initial body has 9 cells, plus the head makes 10? Or wait, initial body list is 9 cells, so with the head, it's 10 segments.

Wait, the snake's length can be determined by the number of body cells plus one (the head). So initial body is 9, so total length is 10. When moving, each step adds a new head and removes the tail unless eating an apple.

So after moving to (8,1), the body has 9 cells: [(7,1), (6,1), ..., (0,2)]. Then moving to (9,1) makes the body [(8,1), (7,1), ..., (0,2)].

Then, when moving UP from (9,1) to (9,2):

The new head is (9,2). The old head (9,1) becomes part of the body. So the new body is [ (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), ..., up to some point ]. But the tail would be removed because we didn't eat an apple yet.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to simulate each step:

Initial state:
Head: (7,1)
Body: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2)]

After first move (RIGHT to 8,1):
Head: (8,1)
Body becomes [(7,1)] + all the previous body except tail? Or does it include all previous cells?

Wait, no. When the snake moves, the new head is added at the front, and if not eating an apple, the last cell is removed.

So initial body has 9 cells. After moving RIGHT, the new head is (8,1), so the body becomes [ (7,1) ] + previous body excluding the last cell? Or maybe it's [ (6,1), (5,1), ..., (0,2) ] plus (7,1).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each move as:

- New head = current head + direction vector.
- The new body is the list of previous positions except the tail, and then add the old head to the front.

No, that's not right. When moving without eating an apple, the snake's body shifts: the head moves, and the tail is removed.

So for example:

Initial:
Head: (7,1)
Body: [ (6,1), (5,1), ..., (0,2) ]

After move RIGHT to (8,1):
New head: (8,1)
Body becomes [ (7,1) ] + previous body excluding the last cell. So new body is [ (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), ... , (0,2) ] but without the last cell? Or wait, no—when you move, each segment follows the one in front of it.

Actually, when moving, the head moves, and all body segments follow. The tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So initial body: [B1, B2, ..., B9] where B1 is (6,1), B2=(5,1)... up to B9=(1,2).

After moving RIGHT:

Head becomes (8,1)
Body becomes [B1', B2', ..., B8'] where each Bi' is the position of the previous Bi. So B1' = (7,1) (old head), B2' = (6,1), etc., and then the tail (B9=(1,2)) is removed.

Wait no—the body list in the input doesn't include the current head. So after moving, the new body list will be [ (8-1=7,1) ] + previous body except last?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model each move step by step, ensuring that the new position isn't colliding with any part of the updated body.

Let me try to simulate:

Move 1: RIGHT from (7,1) → (8,1)

Check collision:
- New head is (8,1)
- Body after this move will be [ (7,1), (6,1), ..., (0,2) ]
So does (8,1) collide with any of these? No, because 8 > all x's in the body except (0,2). So safe.

Move 2: RIGHT again → (9,1)

Check collision:
- New head is (9,1)
- Body after move will be [ (8,1), (7,1), ..., (0,2) ]
No collision with (9,1).

Now, from here, we need to start moving UP. But let's check if moving UP is possible without hitting the body.

Move 3: UP → (9,2)

Check collision:
- Body after this move would be [ (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), ..., (0,2) ] but tail might have been removed. Wait, no apple eaten yet, so tail is removed. So new body is [ (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) ]

So new head is (9,2). Is this position in the body? The body has x from 1-8 on y=1, and x=0 on y=2. So no collision.

Move 4: UP → (9,3)

Body after move:
[ (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), ..., (2,1) ]

No collision with (9,3).

Continue this until reaching (9,8):

So moves would be:

RIGHT, RIGHT, then seven UPs.

Total moves: 2 +7=9 steps.

But wait, the apple is at (9,8). So after moving to (9,8), we eat it, so the snake doesn't lose a segment. Therefore, when making the last move, do I need to check if the new position is the apple?

Yes, but in this case, (9,8) is the apple's position.

So let me re-examine:

After moving to (9,7), next move is UP to (9,8). At that point, we eat the apple, so the body doesn't lose a segment. So the body after eating would be [ (9,7), (9,6), ..., (2,1) ] and then including all previous positions without losing the tail.

Wait, no—eating an apple makes the snake longer by one segment. So when moving to (9,8), since it's the apple, we don't remove the tail, so body remains as [ (9,7), (9,6), ..., (2,1) ] plus (9,8).

But in any case, as long as each move doesn't result in the new head colliding with any part of the body after the move.

So step-by-step:

Move 1: RIGHT → (8,1). Body becomes [ (7,1), (6,1), ..., (0,2) ]

No collision.

Move 2: RIGHT → (9,1). Body becomes [ (8,1), (7,1), ..., (0,2) ]

No collision.

Move 3: UP → (9,2). Body becomes [ (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), ..., (1,1) ] (tail removed)

No collision with (9,2).

Move 4: UP → (9,3). Body becomes [ (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), ..., (2,1) ]

No collision.

Similarly for moves 5-9:

Each UP move will add a new head at (9,y) where y increases by 1 each time. Each time, the body shifts, but since we're moving straight up and none of these positions are in the body after each shift, it should be safe.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

RIGHT, RIGHT, then seven UPs. Total moves: 2+7=9.

But wait, let's count the exact number of moves required:

From (7,1) to (8,1): move 1

(8,1) → (9,1): move 2

Then from y=1 to y=8 is 7 moves. So total 9 moves.

Alternatively, perhaps it can be done in fewer moves if we change direction earlier, but since moving straight right and then up is the shortest path, that's optimal.

So the final sequence of moves would be:

Right, Right, Up, Up, Up, Up, Up, Up, Up.

Which translates to 'RRUUUUUUU' (2 rights and 7 ups).
</think>

The snake needs to move right twice to reach column 9 and then up seven times to reach row 8. Each movement is in the cardinal direction, either Right ('R') or Up ('U'). The sequence ensures that each new head position doesn't collide with the body after the move.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Move Right**: From (7,1) → (8,1). Body updates to include (7,1) and removes tail. No collision.
2. **Move Right again**: From (8,1) → (9,1). Body includes (8,1), no collision.
3. **Move Up seven times**:
   - Each move takes the snake up one row without colliding with its body.

The optimal path requires 9 moves: two rights and seven ups.

**Answer**: \boxed{RRUUUUUUU}
