<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find a sequence of directions that allows the snake to safely reach and eat the apple without causing any collisions.

First, I'll note down the given information:

- **Head position**: (6, 8)
- **Current direction**: LEFT
- **Body cells**: [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]
- **Apple position**: (0,9)

The snake is on a 10x10 grid. The head is at (6,8), which is near the top-right corner but not too close to the edge considering it's a 10x10 grid. The current direction is LEFT, meaning if no change, the next move would be towards decreasing x.

The body cells are arranged in such a way that each subsequent cell is adjacent to the previous one. Starting from (7,8), then (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), and finally (8,7). So, the tail is at (8,7).

The apple is at (0,9), which is at the very top-left corner of the grid.

Let me visualize this. The snake's head is at (6,8), and it needs to move towards (0,9). The distance in x-direction is 6 units left, and y-direction is +1 unit up.

Now, considering movement rules:

- **Cannot reverse direction immediately**: Since current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT, but since we're already moving LEFT, perhaps staying in the same direction makes sense until necessary.

But let's look at the path from (6,8) to (0,9). The direct path would require moving left 6 times and up once. However, the snake's body is blocking some paths, so I need to plan a route that avoids collisions with its own body segments.

Looking at the current body:

From head (6,8), the next body part is (7,8) which is one step right of the head. Then it goes to (8,8), (9,8), then down to (9,7), and (8,7). So, the snake's body extends from (6,8) all the way down to (8,7).

So, moving left immediately would take the head to (5,8). But I need to check if that position is safe.

Wait, but according to movement rules, when the head moves, the body segments move as well. So, after each move, the old head becomes the first body segment, and the tail either stays or moves depending on whether an apple was eaten.

But in this case, since we haven't eaten the apple yet, moving towards it requires careful planning to avoid the body.

Let me consider possible paths:

Option 1: Move up then left. But current direction is LEFT; if I move UP next, that's allowed since it's not reversing.

Wait, but the head is at (6,8), which is one step below the top row (y=9). So moving UP from here would take it to (6,9), but wait, in the grid, y ranges from 0 to 9. Wait no: (0,9) is top-right corner, so (6,8) is near the top but on the right side.

Wait correction: The head is at (6,8). So moving UP would take it to (6,9), which is allowed as y can be up to 9. But then from there, moving left multiple times towards (0,9).

But wait, apple is at (0,9), which is top-left corner. Wait no: Apple is at (0,9), which would be the top-left because x=0 is leftmost.

Wait, correction on coordinates:

The grid has (0,0) as bottom-left and (9,9) as top-right. So (6,8) is somewhere in the upper half towards the right side. The apple at (0,9) is top-left corner.

So to get from (6,8) to (0,9), the snake needs to move left 6 times and up once.

But how?

Wait: From (6,8), moving left takes it towards lower x-values. So moving left would take it to (5,8), then (4,8), etc., until (0,8). Then from there, moving up to (0,9).

But the body is currently blocking some of these paths.

Looking at the current body: after the head, we have (7,8) which is right of the head. So when the snake moves left, that's possible as long as the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail if it's moving.

Wait, but according to movement rules, when checking for collisions, the new_head cannot coincide with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So in other words, except for the case where the next position is the tail and the snake is about to eat an apple (thus not moving the tail), the new head can't be on any body segment.

In our initial state, after moving left once from (6,8) to (5,8), we need to check if that's safe. The body segments are at (7,8), (8,8), etc. So (5,8) is not part of the body, so it's safe.

So first move: LEFT.

But wait, current direction is LEFT, and according to movement rules, you cannot reverse direction immediately. Since moving LEFT again is allowed because it's the same as current direction.

Wait no: Reversing would be if current direction is LEFT and next direction is RIGHT. So if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT, but moving LEFT or UP/DOWN is fine.

So in this case, since we're at (6,8), moving LEFT again to (5,8) seems safe.

But let's see how the body would update after that move:

After moving LEFT, new_head is (5,8). The old head (6,8) becomes the first body segment. So the body list becomes [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ].

But wait, the body list given is [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)], which excludes the head. So after moving, the new_head is (5,8). Then, according to movement rules:

- Insert old head at front of BODY: so new body becomes [ (6,8) ] + [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]

Then, since we're not eating an apple yet, the tail is removed. So the new body list would be [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7) ].

So the snake's head is now at (5,8), and the body extends from there.

Next move: to continue towards (0,9). We need to go up by 1 and left by 6 more. But how?

Wait, but after moving LEFT once, the head is at (5,8). Now, perhaps it's better to start moving UP to reach y=9.

But let me think about possible collisions.

If I move UP from (5,8), new_head would be (5,9). Let's check if that's safe.

At this point, the body segments after the head are [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7) ].

So (5,9) is not part of the body. So it's safe to move UP.

After moving UP:

- new_head = (5,9)
- insert old head (5,8) into body: body becomes [ (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7) ]
- remove tail: since not eating apple, remove last element (9,7). So new body is [ (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8) ]

So now the snake's head is at (5,9), and it needs to move left 5 more times.

But wait, from (5,9), moving left would take it to (4,9). Let's check if that's safe.

The body after UP move is [ (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8) ]

So (4,9) is not part of the body. So moving LEFT again would be safe.

But wait, moving from (5,9) to (4,9): no collision.

After this move:

- new_head = (4,9)
- insert old head (5,9) into body: body becomes [ (5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8) ]
- remove tail: since not eating apple, the last element is removed. So new body is [ (5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) ]

So this seems safe.

Continuing this way:

Next move LEFT to (3,9).

Again, check if (3,9) is in the body: current body after previous moves is [ (5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) ]. So no collision.

Proceeding:

After moving LEFT again, head at (3,9). Body becomes [ (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) ] then tail removed. So body is now [ (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8) ]

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to plan each move step by step.

But perhaps another approach: the snake needs to go from (6,8) to (0,9). The minimal path would require moving left 6 steps and up 1 step. But since we can't do both at once, we need a way to navigate around the body.

Alternatively, maybe move up first to (6,9), then move left multiple times, but considering that after each move, the body shifts, which could block some paths.

Wait, let's consider moving UP first.

From (6,8), if we move UP, new_head is (6,9). Then:

- Insert old head into body: so body becomes [ (6,8) ] + existing body [ (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]

So body after moving up would be [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ].

Then remove the tail: last element is (8,7). So new body is [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7) ]

So head at (6,9), which is one step up from original position. Now, moving left would take it to (5,9).

Is that safe? The current body after the head is [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7) ]

So (5,9) is not part of the body. So safe.

Then next move LEFT: new_head at (5,9). Body becomes [ (6,9), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7) ] then tail removed, so body is [ (6,9), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8) ]

Proceeding left to (4,9): same process.

But this seems similar to moving left first. So perhaps either approach works.

However, in the initial state, the snake's body is extending to the right and down. If we move left first, we can navigate more freely towards the top-left without immediately conflicting with the body.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP then LEFT multiple times would be better.

But let me think about potential obstacles.

After each move, the body shifts. So if I start moving up, that might create space on the right side.

Wait, but it's a bit complicated to track all possible positions. Maybe a better approach is to see whether the path from (6,8) to (0,9) can be achieved by making moves that don't conflict with the body at each step.

Given that the apple is at (0,9), and current head is at (6,8):

Option 1: Move LEFT six times and then UP once. But after each LEFT move, the body will shift, potentially blocking the path.

Wait, but moving left first:

Move 1: LEFT to (5,8). Safe.

Move 2: LEFT to (4,8). Safe.

Move 3: LEFT to (3,8). Safe.

Move 4: LEFT to (2,8). Safe.

Move 5: LEFT to (1,8). Safe.

Move 6: LEFT to (0,8). Now, check if moving UP from here is safe.

At this point, the body after six LEFT moves would have:

Each move adds the old head to the body and removes the tail. So starting with head at (6,8), after first LEFT:

Body becomes [ (6,8) ] + existing body except last element? Wait no: when moving left, you insert the old head into the front of the body list and then remove the last element if not eating apple.

Wait, movement steps:

When head moves to new position, old head becomes first body segment. Then, tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So initial state after move 1 (LEFT):

Head: (5,8)

Body: [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ] → Wait no. Initial body cells are [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]. After moving LEFT:

Insert old head (6,8) at front: new body becomes [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7) ]

Then, since not eating apple, remove the last element (8,7). So new body is [ (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7) ]

So after move 1, head at (5,8), body as above.

Move 2: LEFT to (4,8)

Body becomes [ (5,8) ] + previous body → [ (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7) ]

Remove last element (9,7). So new body is [ (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8) ]

Move 3: LEFT to (3,8)

Body becomes [ (4,8) ] + previous body → [ (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8) ]

Remove last element (9,8). New body is [ (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) ]

Move 4: LEFT to (2,8)

Body becomes [ (3,8) ] + previous body → [ (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) ]

Remove last element (8,8). New body is [ (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8) ]

Move 5: LEFT to (1,8)

Body becomes [ (2,8) ] + previous body → [ (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8) ]

Remove last element (7,8). New body is [ (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8) ]

Move 6: LEFT to (0,8)

Body becomes [ (1,8) ] + previous body → [ (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8) ]

Remove last element (6,8). New body is [ (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8) ]

Now, head is at (0,8). Next move would be UP to (0,9).

But let's check if that's safe.

The current body after six LEFT moves and before moving UP is [ (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8) ]

So (0,9) is not part of the body. So it's safe to move UP.

After moving UP:

Head at (0,9)

Insert old head (0,8) into body: [ (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8) ]

Since we are moving towards the apple, but haven't eaten it yet. So remove last element (5,8). New body is [ (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8) ]

Thus, head at (0,9), which is the apple's position.

But wait, in this case, moving UP would land us on the apple. So we've reached it.

Wait no: The apple is at (0,9). Our head was at (0,8). Moving UP takes it to (0,9), so yes, that's where the apple is.

So by making six LEFT moves and one UP move, we reach the apple.

But let me count how many moves: 6 LEFTs and 1 UP. But wait, after each move, the direction can change? Or must I keep moving in a straight line?

Wait, no. Each move is a single step, but direction can change between moves.

So initial direction is LEFT. For first move, we can choose to move LEFT again or change to another direction (UP or DOWN).

But according to movement rules, you cannot reverse direction immediately. So if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT, but can be LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

In this plan, after moving six times LEFT and then once UP, we reach the apple. But that would require making a change in direction from LEFT to UP on the seventh move.

But wait, can we do that? Because each time you make a turn, it's allowed unless it's a reverse.

Wait, no: reversal is not allowed immediately, but turning left or right (if considering grid movement) is allowed. But in this case, it's just changing direction from LEFT to UP. Since the current direction was LEFT, and UP is perpendicular, that's allowed.

But wait, the rules as given don't specify whether you can change direction at will except that you cannot reverse immediately.

Assuming that reversing means moving back in the opposite direction (e.g., RIGHT after LEFT), but turning left or right (i.e., changing direction perpendicularly) is allowed.

So in this case, moving from LEFT to UP would be a 90-degree turn, which is allowed.

Therefore, this path should work: six moves LEFT and one move UP.

But wait, when you make the UP move, your new head is at (0,9), which is the apple's position. So that completes the task.

So in total, seven moves: six LEFTs and one UP.

Alternatively, another way could be moving UP first and then LEFT, but I think this path works.

Wait, but when you reach (0,8) after six LEFT moves, can you then move UP? Yes, because it's not a reversal. So that should be fine.

Thus, the solution is to make six consecutive LEFT moves followed by one UP move.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its initial position to the position of an apple on a grid. The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), but it cannot reverse direction immediately after moving in the opposite direction.

### Approach
The goal is to move the snake from the starting position `(6, 8)` to the apple located at `(0, 9)`. The optimal path involves moving the snake six times to the left and then once upwards. This approach ensures that we do not reverse direction immediately and efficiently reach the target.

1. **Move Left Six Times**: Starting from `(6, 8)`, each move to the left decreases the x-coordinate by 1. After six moves, the snake will be at position `(0, 8)` with its body adjusted accordingly.
2. **Move Up Once**: From `(0, 8)`, moving up once increases the y-coordinate by 1, bringing the head of the snake to the apple's location `(0, 9)`.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial position of the snake's head
head = (6, 8)
apple = (0, 9)

# Directions: left, right, up, down
directions = ['left', 'right', 'up', 'down']

current_direction = 'left'

# Move left six times
for _ in range(6):
    if current_direction == 'left':
        head = (head[0] - 1, head[1])
    elif current_direction == 'right':
        head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
    elif current_direction == 'up':
        head = (head[0], head[1] + 1)
    else:
        head = (head[0], head[1] - 1)

# Change direction to up after six left moves
current_direction = 'up'
head = (head[0], head[1] + 1)

print("Snake reaches the apple at:", head)
```

### Explanation
The solution involves a series of movements where the snake first moves left repeatedly to align its head directly below the apple. Once in position, it then moves up to reach the apple's location. This approach ensures that each move is valid and does not involve reversing direction immediately, adhering to the problem constraints. The snake successfully navigates from `(6, 8)` to `(0, 9)` in seven moves: six lefts followed by one up.
