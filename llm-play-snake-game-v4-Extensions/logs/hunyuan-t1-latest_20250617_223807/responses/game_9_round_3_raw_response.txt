"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 7 units down (from y=7 to y=0) and 8 units right (from x=1 to x=9). Moving down first avoids collision with the initial body segments (which are to the right of the head). After shifting the body down 7 times, the head reaches (1,0) with the body trailing vertically. Then, moving right 8 times navigates the head to (9,0) while the body shifts right, avoiding collisions. This path ensures continuous movement without self-collision and reaches the apple safely."
