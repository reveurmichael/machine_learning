========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's break down how I approached solving this Snake problem. 

First, I looked at the current state of the game. The snake's head is at (3,7), and it needs to reach the apple at (0,7). The body cells are [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)], so the snake is currently moving upwards along the same x-coordinate as the apple.

I considered the movement rules. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN to avoid reversing. I started by planning a path that goes directly towards the apple without unnecessary detours.

The apple is to the left of the head, so I needed to make LEFT moves. However, because the snake's body is in front, moving LEFT initially might cause collision. So, I first moved UP once to extend the body and get out of the way.

After that, it's safe to move LEFT three times to reach x=0. Throughout this path, I made sure that each move doesn't collide with the body or go out of bounds. Also, after eating the apple, I ensured there was at least one legal move left to avoid traps.

Finally, I checked the required moves to ensure the number of LEFTs and UPs/RIGHTs/DOWNS matched the Manhattan distance constraints.

{
  "moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake first moves up to extend its body safely, then moves left three times to reach the apple at (0,7) without colliding with itself or going out of bounds."
}
