========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's break this down step by step. The snake is at (7,7), and the apple is at (5,8). So, I need to figure out a path from (7,7) to (5,8) without colliding with any walls or body parts, and ensuring that after each move, the snake doesn't reverse direction and stays within bounds.

First, let's note the current state. The head is at (7,7), and the body cells are [(7,6), (7,5)]. So the snake is moving downward because each subsequent body part is below the previous one. The current direction is "UP," which seems odd because from (7,7) to (7,6) would be down, but maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no—the head is at (7,7), and the body is behind it. So if the direction is "UP," then the next segment should be above the head. But in this case, the next segments are below. Hmm, that might indicate an error or a specific setup.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The current direction is "UP." So each move, the snake's head moves up (y increases by 1). However, the body cells are [(7,6), (7,5)], which suggests that after moving up from (7,7) to (7,8), the next segments would be (7,7) and then (7,6). But since the current direction is "UP," perhaps the snake was previously moving up, but the body is below because it's in a loop or something.

Wait no—the body cells are ordered from immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the head is at (7,7), and the body segments are [(7,6), (7,5)], that suggests the snake was previously moving down because each segment after the head is below it. But the current direction is "UP," which would mean the head is about to move up.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is "UP," the next move can't be "DOWN."

The apple is at (5,8). From (7,7), that's two steps to the left and one step up. So Manhattan distance is 3. But the path needs to avoid any collisions with body segments.

First move: The snake is facing UP, so if it moves UP from (7,7), the new head would be at (7,8). Let's check for collisions. The body cells are [(7,6), (7,5)], which are two steps below the current head. So moving up to (7,8) doesn't collide with any body segments because none of them are at y=8 except possibly if the tail is about to move.

Wait, but when checking for collisions, new_head can't coincide with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So in this case, since the direction is UP, and the body cells are behind the head moving up, does that mean the tail is at (7,5)? When we move to (7,8), the tail would not be moving because it hasn't been shifted yet unless the apple is eaten.

Wait, but the apple isn't at (7,8); it's at (5,8). So moving UP first might not eat the apple. Let me see:

If the snake moves UP from (7,7) to (7,8), then the body segments would update as follows: insert old head (7,7) at the front of BODY, making it [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]. Since new_head is not the apple's position, the tail is removed. So after this move, the snake's body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)], and the head is now at (7,8).

But wait, the current direction is "UP," so moving UP again would take us to (7,9). But 9 is within bounds since y ranges from 0-9. Wait no: coordinates go up to (9,9), but in this case, the grid is 10x10, so x and y can be 0 to 9 inclusive. So moving UP from y=8 would take us to y=9, which is valid.

But perhaps it's better to plan a different path because after moving up once, we might not have enough space to maneuver.

Alternatively, maybe the snake should move LEFT first to get closer to the apple in terms of x-coordinate. From (7,7), moving LEFT would take us to (6,7). Then, we can continue moving UP or LEFT as needed.

Wait, but let's think about the required movement: from (7,7) to (5,8). So, the x decreases by 2 and y increases by 1. The minimal path would involve two LEFT moves and one UP move in some order. But considering that after each move, the body shifts.

But we have to avoid collisions with the body. Let's see:

Current head: (7,7)
Body cells: [(7,6), (7,5)]

So moving LEFT from (7,7) would take us to (6,7). Is this position safe? The body segments are below the current head, so at y=6 and y=5. So moving left won't collide with any body segments except possibly if the tail is about to move.

Wait, when we move LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7), the new_head would be checked against the existing body cells before updating. The existing body cells are [(7,6), (7,5)], so no collision occurs because none of them are at (6,7). So that's safe.

After moving LEFT once:

Head: (6,7)
Body becomes: insert old head (7,7) at front → [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]. Then, since we're not eating the apple (apple is at (5,8)), we remove the tail. So body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)].

Wait no: the body list in the input is [(7,6), (7,5)], so after moving left, the new head is (6,7). We insert old head (7,7) at front of body list → [ (7,7), (7,6), (7,5) ]. Then, since apple isn't eaten, remove last element (7,5). So body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)].

So new snake is:
Head: (6,7)
Body: [(7,7), (7,6)]

Now, from here, the next move can be LEFT again? Wait, current direction was "UP" but we moved LEFT. Is that allowed? Because after moving, the new direction would be "LEFT," so the previous direction is now overwritten.

Wait no—each move's direction choice must follow the rules: you can't reverse direction. So from a previous direction of "UP," you can choose any other direction except "DOWN." So if we first moved LEFT, which is allowed because it's not the reverse of UP (reverse would be DOWN). Then, in the next step, our current direction is LEFT, so we can't move RIGHT.

Wait no: movement rules state that you cannot reverse. If current direction is "UP," next move can't be "DOWN." So if the first move is LEFT after being in UP direction, then the new current direction becomes LEFT, and the next move can't be RIGHT.

But perhaps I'm getting confused with how directions change. Each move must choose a direction that isn't the reverse of the previous one. For example, if the snake was moving UP, it can't move DOWN next; but if it moves LEFT after UP, then in the next step, it can't move RIGHT.

So let's outline possible first steps:

Option 1: Move UP from (7,7) → (7,8)
- Check for collision: no body segments at y=8 except possibly when tail shifts. Since apple is at (5,8), which is two to the left and one up from current position.

But wait, moving UP takes us closer to the apple in terms of y-coordinate but moves away in x. So perhaps not optimal.

Option 2: Move LEFT → (6,7)
- Safe, as discussed earlier.
Then next move could be UP or further LEFT.

But let's simulate moving LEFT first.

After moving LEFT once:

Head: (6,7)
Body: [(7,7), (7,6)]
Direction now is "LEFT."

Next move can't be RIGHT. So options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But we need to reach x=5 and y=8. From (6,7), moving up would take us closer in y but not x. Alternatively, another LEFT to (5,7).

So second move: LEFT → (5,7)
Check for collision with body cells [(7,7), (7,6)]. None at (5,7). So safe.

Now head is at (5,7), direction is LEFT.

Body becomes after moving:
Insert old head (6,7) → [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6)].
Then remove tail (7,6), so body is [(6,7), (7,7)]? Wait no: original body was [(7,7), (7,6)], but after inserting old head (6,7) at front, it's [ (6,7), (7,7), (7,6) ]. Then remove last element (7,6). So body is now [ (6,7), (7,7) ].

Wait that doesn't make sense because the tail would be moving. Wait no: when you move LEFT from (5,7), the new head is at (5,7). The old head was at (6,7), so insert into body list → [ (6,7), (7,7), (7,6) ]. Then, since not eating apple, remove last element (7,6). So body becomes [ (6,7), (7,7) ].

So now, head is at (5,7), direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.

We need to get to y=8, so perhaps move UP from here.

Third move: UP → (5,8)
Check for collision with current body [(6,7), (7,7)].
- The new head would be at (5,8). None of the body segments are there. Also, since we're not eating the apple yet—wait, no! Apple is at (5,8). So moving UP to (5,8) would mean eating the apple.

So after this move:

Head: (5,8)
Body becomes:
Insert old head (5,7) → [ (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) ].
Since we ate the apple, do not remove tail. So body is [ (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) ].

Now, direction is UP.

This seems to reach the apple in three moves: LEFT, LEFT, UP.

But wait, let's verify each step for safety.

First move: LEFT from (7,7) → (6,7). Safe.

Second move: LEFT from (6,7) → (5,7). Safe.

Third move: UP from (5,7) → (5,8). Apple is here, so collision? Wait no—the apple is at (5,8), and the head is moving there. It's allowed; that's how you get the apple.

But we have to ensure that after this move, the body doesn't collide with itself. After moving UP, the body segments are [(5,7), (6,7), (7,7)].

So overall path: LEFT → LEFT → UP.

This seems feasible.

Alternatively, could we do it in fewer moves? Let's see:

Is there a way to move UP first and then LEFT twice?

First move: UP from (7,7) → (7,8). Safe.
Second move: LEFT from (7,8) → (6,8).
Third move: LEFT again → (5,8). Now, check if the head can be at (5,8).

But let's see:

After first move UP to (7,8), body becomes [ (7,7), (7,6) ].

Second move: LEFT from (7,8) → (6,8). Check collision with body [(7,7), (7,6)]. No collision. So safe.

Body after second move:
Insert old head (7,8) → [ (7,8), (7,7), (7,6) ].
Since not eating apple, remove tail (7,6). Body becomes [ (7,8), (7,7) ].

Third move: LEFT from (6,8) → (5,8). Check collision with body [(7,8), (7,7)]. No. So safe.

So after third move:

Head: (5,8)
Body: [ (6,8), (7,8) ]

But wait, we didn't eat the apple because the apple is at (5,8), so when moving there, it's a collision? Or is that how you collect apples. So in this case, yes, it would be a valid move.

So two possible paths:

1. LEFT → LEFT → UP
2. UP → LEFT → LEFT

Both reach the apple in three moves without collisions.

But let's check direction restrictions.

In path 1:
- Initial direction: UP.
- First move: LEFT (allowed, not reverse of UP).
- Second move: LEFT again (allowed, since previous was LEFT, can't go RIGHT).
- Third move: UP (since previous was LEFT, which is allowed).

Wait no: after first move to LEFT, the new direction is LEFT. So next moves must avoid moving RIGHT.

So path 1:

Move 1: LEFT
Move 2: LEFT
Move 3: UP

This should be allowed because each subsequent move doesn't reverse direction.

Similarly for path 2:

Move 1: UP (from initial UP, allowed).
Move 2: LEFT (allowed, not reverse of UP).
Move 3: LEFT (allowed, previous was LEFT).

So both paths are valid.

But which one is better? Probably the first one because moving left twice and up once is more straightforward in this case.

Wait, but after moving UP first, the snake's body might be in a different position that could cause issues later. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal path is two LEFTs and one UP in any order as long as direction rules are followed.

But to make it safe, I'll outline the steps:

First move: LEFT from (7,7) → (6,7). Safe.
Second move: LEFT again → (5,7). Safe.
Third move: UP → (5,8). Eat apple. Safe.

So three moves in total.

Therefore, the sequence is:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. UP

Each move is allowed under direction rules and avoids collision.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its current position to an apple while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body. The snake starts at position (7,7) and needs to reach the apple at (5,8). The snake's body parts are located behind it, and it cannot reverse direction immediately after each move.

### Approach
1. **Understand Movement Constraints**: The snake can move in four directions but cannot reverse its previous direction immediately. For example, if the snake moves up, it cannot move down next.
2. **Calculate Manhattan Distance**: The distance from (7,7) to (5,8) is calculated as 3 units (two left and one up).
3. **Determine Path Strategy**: The optimal path involves moving two steps to the left and then one step up. This ensures minimal movement while avoiding collisions with the snake's body.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial position of the head
head = (7, 7)
apple = (5, 8)
body = [(7,6), (7,5)]
directions = ['UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT']

# Move 1: LEFT
new_head = (6, 7)
if new_head != any(b for b in body) and not collision_with_body(new_head, body):
    head = new_head
    direction = 'LEFT'
    body.insert(0, (7,7))
    if head != apple:
        body.pop()
else:
    # Handle collision or invalid move
    pass

# Move 2: LEFT again
new_head = (5, 7)
if new_head != any(b for b in body) and not collision_with_body(new_head, body):
    head = new_head
    direction = 'LEFT'
    body.insert(0, (6,7))
    if head != apple:
        body.pop()
else:
    # Handle collision or invalid move
    pass

# Move 3: UP to reach the apple
new_head = (5, 8)
if new_head == apple and not collision_with_body(new_head, body):
    head = new_head
    direction = 'UP'
    body.insert(0, (5,7))
else:
    # Handle collision or invalid move
    pass

print("Snake successfully ate the apple.")
```

### Explanation
1. **First Move**: The snake moves LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7). This is a valid move as it does not collide with its body.
2. **Second Move**: The snake moves LEFT again from (6,7) to (5,7). This is also a valid move without any collisions.
3. **Third Move**: The snake moves UP from (5,7) to (5,8), where the apple is located. This move is valid as it reaches the target without collision.

This approach ensures that each move follows the direction constraints and avoids any self-collisions, allowing the snake to reach the apple efficiently.
