<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the snake from (4,2) to eat the apple at (0,1). Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. The snake is on a 10x10 grid, with (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at the top-right. So (4,2) is somewhere in the middle, and the apple is at (0,1), which is near the left side, just one row up from the bottom.

The snake's current direction is "RIGHT". The body cells are given as [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)]. So starting from the head at (4,2), the next segment is (3,2), then moving up to (3,3), and so on. The tail is at (5,4).

I need to plan a path for the snake's head to reach (0,1) without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds.

First, let me calculate the Manhattan distance from the head to the apple. The current head position is (4,2), and the apple is at (0,1). So the x-distance is 4-0=4 units left, and the y-distance is 2-1=1 unit up. So the snake needs to move LEFT 4 times and UP once.

But I can't just go straight because the body might block the path or cause a collision.

Looking at the current direction: the snake is moving RIGHT, which means its next possible direction can't be LEFT (since that's reversing). Wait, no—the rules say you cannot reverse. So if the current direction is "RIGHT", the next move can't be "LEFT". But in this case, since the current direction is "RIGHT", the first move must not be "LEFT".

Wait, no: according to rule 2 of movement rules, you can't choose the opposite direction as the current direction. So if currently moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.

So, from (4,2) facing RIGHT, the possible moves are UP and DOWN, but wait—no, that's not right. The directions allowed when current is RIGHT: any except DOWN? No, wait, movement rule 2 says you cannot reverse. So if moving RIGHT, next direction can't be LEFT. But what about other directions?

Yes, from a current direction of "RIGHT", the next move can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (i.e., not LEFT). So in this case, first move options are UP and DOWN.

But wait, that's only when making the first move after being in NONE direction? Or always. Hmm, no: according to rule 2, you cannot reverse on any move. So if current direction is "RIGHT", next can't be "LEFT".

So from (4,2), currently moving RIGHT, the possible directions for the first move are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But wait, in the initial state, the snake's body is behind it. Let me see where the body is: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)]. So starting from the head at (4,2), moving right would have caused this configuration.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to map out the snake's body:

Head is at (4,2). The next segment is (3,2) which is left of the head—so that suggests that the snake was moving LEFT before, but the current direction is RIGHT. Wait, no: because in the movement update rule, when you move, you compute new_head and then add it to the front.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the current state: head at (4,2), body cells as given. So the snake extends from (4,2) to (3,2), up to (3,5), etc.

Now, the apple is at (0,1). To get there, the head needs to move left and then up.

But since the first move can't be LEFT because current direction is RIGHT, so possible options are UP or DOWN. Let's see:

If I choose UP as the first move: new_head would be (4,3). Then check for collisions.

Is (4,3) within bounds? Yes. Does it collide with any body cells except possibly the tail?

The body cells after head are [(3,2), ...]. So the current body is at (3,2), which is to the left of the head. The new_head (4,3) would be adjacent to (4,2). But the body's next segment is (3,2)—so no collision except if any body cells are at (4,3).

Looking at the body list: [(3,2), (3,3), ...], so no. So moving UP is safe.

Then, after moving UP, the body would be updated by inserting the old head (4,2) to the front of the body list. The new body becomes [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), etc.] Then, since we didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed.

Wait, but in this case, the apple is at (0,1), which is not where we moved, so no growth.

So after moving UP, the head is at (4,3). Now, next move can be anything except the reverse of current direction. The current direction after first move would be "UP", so next moves can't be DOWN.

Wait, no: each move's direction is independent as long as it doesn't reverse from the previous direction. So after moving UP once, the new current direction is UP. Then the next move can't be DOWN.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first would be better? Let me check.

If I choose DOWN as the first move: new_head = (4,1). Check for collisions. Is (4,1) within bounds? Yes. Does it collide with any body cells?

The body is [(3,2), ...], so no collision except if any body part is at (4,1). Current body list doesn't include (4,1), so safe.

After moving DOWN, the head is at (4,1). Then, next moves can be anything except UP (since current direction would be DOWN).

But from (4,1), I need to get to (0,1). That's four LEFT moves. But each move can't be opposite of previous direction. So after moving DOWN once, the next direction could be RIGHT? Wait no: current direction is DOWN; next move can't be UP.

Wait, let me think again. Current direction is "DOWN" after moving down from (4,2) to (4,1). The next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. So I need to make sure that the path allows for that.

But since the apple is at (0,1), which is four cells to the left, perhaps it's better to go up first and then left.

Alternatively, moving UP once might create a path where we can turn LEFT multiple times without reversing direction.

Let me think about possible paths.

Option 1: Move UP first. Then from (4,3), next moves could be LEFT, but need to check for collisions with body.

Wait, after moving UP, the body is now [(4,2), (3,2), ...]. So when I move LEFT from (4,3) next, new_head would be (3,3). But the first body cell is (4,2), which is not in the same column. So that's safe.

But let me check: after moving UP to (4,3), the body becomes [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]. Wait no—the body is updated by inserting old head at front. So initial body was [(3,2), ...]. After moving UP, new_head is (4,3). The body becomes [ (4,2) ] followed by the previous body list.

Wait, according to movement update rule 3a: insert old head position at front of BODY. So the new body starts with the old head, then the rest.

So after moving UP:

BODY was [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)].

After inserting old head (4,2) at front, it becomes [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., (5,4)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the last element. So new body is [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)].

Wait no—after inserting old head at front, the BODY becomes [old_head] + BODY list. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element.

So initial body: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)].

After inserting old head (4,2) at front: new_body = [ (4,2) ] + [ (3,2), ... , (5,4) ] → length 8.

Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element (5,4). So body becomes [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) ].

So now the snake's body is from head (4,3) down to tail at (4,4).

Wait, no—the new_head is (4,3). The body after moving UP and updating would be [ (4,2), ... , (4,4) ]. So when the head moves to (4,3), which is adjacent to (4,2), it's safe.

So from (4,3), next possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again? Wait, current direction after moving UP would be "UP". Next move can't be DOWN. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

If I choose LEFT: new_head is (3,3). Check collision with body cells [(4,2), ...].

The first body cell after head is (4,2)—distance from (3,3) to (4,2) is diagonal, so no collision. So moving LEFT is safe.

After moving LEFT to (3,3), the body is updated by inserting old head (4,3) at front: [ (4,3), (4,2), ... , (4,4) ].

Then remove last element if not eating apple. So body becomes [ (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) ].

Now, from (3,3), next direction can't be RIGHT because current is LEFT? Wait no—current direction was LEFT. So next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, movement rule: cannot reverse. So if you're moving LEFT, next can't be RIGHT.

So from (3,3), possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But we need to get to (0,1). From (3,3), moving left would take us towards the apple's row (y=1 is lower than y=3). Wait no—(0,1) is at x=0, y=1. So from (3,3), I need to move LEFT 3 times and DOWN twice.

But wait, current head is at (4,2). After moving UP to (4,3), then LEFT to (3,3). From here, moving further left would require moving LEFT again, which is allowed as the previous direction was LEFT.

So next move: LEFT from (3,3) to (2,3).

Check collision: body after inserting old head (3,3) is [ (4,3), (4,2), ... ]. So new_head is (2,3). The first body cell is (4,3)—distance is 2 in x-direction; no collision.

Proceeding to move LEFT again to (1,3).

Then again to (0,3). But apple is at (0,1), so need to move down from (0,3) to (0,2) then to (0,1).

But wait, after moving left all the way to (0,3), can we turn down?

Let's see:

After moving LEFT three times from (4,3):

First move: LEFT to (3,3). Body updated.

Second move: LEFT to (2,3). Body updated.

Third move: LEFT to (1,3).

Fourth move: LEFT to (0,3).

Now head is at (0,3), which is same x as apple but y=3 vs 1. Now need to move DOWN twice.

But each time moving DOWN from (0,3) to (0,2), then to (0,1). But when moving DOWN, the direction changes. So let's check for collisions:

At (0,3), body is ... well, the body would have been updated each step. It might be a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better path that doesn't require moving all the way left and then down, perhaps by first going up more to create space.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let me count:

First move: UP → (4,3).

Second move: LEFT → (3,3).

Third move: LEFT → (2,3).

Fourth move: LEFT → (1,3).

Fifth move: LEFT → (0,3).

Then sixth move: DOWN → (0,2).

Seventh move: DOWN → (0,1). Reached apple.

But each of these moves must not cause collision with body.

Wait, but when moving from (4,3) to (3,3), the body after that is [ (4,3), (4,2), ... ] which doesn't block (3,3).

Similarly, subsequent LEFT moves seem safe as long as the path isn't blocked by the body.

But another issue: the apple is at (0,1). So when moving to (0,3), then down, but after moving into (0,3), can we turn down without collision?

Yes, because the body at that point would be extended towards (0,3) and beyond.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to go up more steps before turning left.

But let me see if I can plan a shorter path.

Wait, another idea: from (4,2), first move DOWN instead of UP. Let's explore this.

First move: DOWN → (4,1).

Check collision: body cells are [(3,2), ...]. So no collision at (4,1). Safe.

Then, next direction can't be UP since current is DOWN.

From (4,1), need to get to (0,1): four LEFT moves.

So:

Move 1: DOWN → (4,1).

Move 2: LEFT → (3,1).

But wait, after moving DOWN, the body becomes [ (4,2) ] + previous body. Wait no—movement rule: when you move, insert old head at front of body.

Original body: [(3,2), (3,3), ..., (5,4)].

After first move DOWN, new_head is (4,1). The body becomes [ (4,2) ] + previous body. Then, since no apple eaten, remove last element (5,4). So new body is [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., (4,4) ].

So from (4,1), next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. Since we need to go left, let's try moving LEFT.

Move 2: LEFT → (3,1). Check collision: body cells are [ (4,2), ... ], so no conflict at (3,1).

Update body: insert old head (4,1) at front → [ (4,1), (4,2), ..., (4,4) ].

Then remove last element if not eating apple. So new body is [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., (4,5) ]? Wait no—let me re-express:

After moving DOWN to (4,1):

Body becomes [ (4,2) ] + original body → [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) ], then remove last element (since no apple eaten). So body is [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) ].

Wait, the original body was 7 elements. Inserting old head makes it 8, then removing last makes it back to 7.

So after moving DOWN and LEFT:

Move 1: DOWN → (4,1). Body becomes [ (4,2), (3,2), ..., (4,4) ], but we remove the last element (5,4), so body is [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) ].

Wait no—original body was [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)].

After inserting old head (4,2), it's [ (4,2), (3,2), ..., (5,4) ] → 8 elements. Then remove last element (5,4). So body becomes [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) ].

Now, from (4,1), moving LEFT to (3,1):

Body after inserting old head (4,1) would be [ (4,1), (4,2), ... , (4,4) ], then remove last element (since no apple eaten). So body becomes [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., (4,5) ].

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me focus on the path:

After moving DOWN to (4,1):

Next move LEFT to (3,1).

Then another LEFT to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (0,1)—but that's four moves from (4,1). But after each move, I need to ensure no collision.

But when moving from (4,1) to (3,1), the body is now [ (4,2), ... ] which doesn't block (3,1).

Similarly, proceeding leftwards seems safe. However, there's a problem: after moving LEFT from (4,1), we might run into the body if it's extended below.

Wait, perhaps this path is better because when you reach (0,1), you can eat the apple without being blocked by your own body.

But actually, in this case, the apple is at (0,1), which is the destination. So as long as the path to (0,1) doesn't intersect with the body except at the tail, it's okay.

However, considering that after each move, the body updates and might block the next move, we need to carefully check.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first is better because the apple is at y=1, which is lower than y=3 where we'd be if we go up.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to plan the moves step by step, ensuring that each move doesn't collide with the body except for the tail.

Let me try planning the moves assuming I go UP first:

Move 1: UP → (4,3).

Body after this move: [ (4,2), ... ] becomes [ (4,3) inserted at front, then previous body without last element ].

But regardless of that, from (4,3):

Move 2: LEFT → (3,3). Safe.

Move 3: LEFT → (2,3). Safe.

Move 4: LEFT → (1,3). Safe.

Move 5: LEFT → (0,3). Now at (0,3).

Now need to go DOWN twice:

Move 6: DOWN → (0,2).

Move 7: DOWN → (0,1). Success.

Total moves: 7. But during each move, we must not collide with body except for the tail.

But let's check after each step whether the new head is colliding with any part of the body except the last segment.

After Move 1: UP to (4,3). Body is now [ (4,2), ... ].

No collision as only the tail was added.

Move 2: LEFT → (3,3). Check if (3,3) is in body. The body is [ (4,2), (3,2), ... ], so no, it's not. Safe.

Move 3: LEFT → (2,3). Body now includes (3,3), but (2,3) isn't part of the body except for the tail.

Wait, after moving to (2,3):

Body is [ (4,3), (4,2), ... ] with last segment being previous tail. So no collision.

Move 4: LEFT → (1,3). Similarly safe.

Move 5: LEFT → (0,3). Safe.

Now at (0,3), need to move DOWN.

But when moving down from (0,3) to (0,2):

Body after inserting old head (0,3) is [ (0,3), ... ], then remove last element if no apple eaten. But since we're not eating, just moving.

So the body will be extending towards (0,3). Moving down to (0,2): check collision. The only part of the body near (0,2) would be from previous moves, but since we moved left all the way, the body is along the path from (4,3) to (0,3), so moving down from (0,3) won't collide with anything except possibly the tail if it's behind.

Wait, but when you move down from (0,3), your head becomes (0,2). The previous segments are [ (4,3), (4,2), ..., (1,3), (0,3) ]—so moving to (0,2) would not overlap with any of these except maybe the tail? No, because the tail is at (something else).

Actually, no—the body is from head (0,3) down through the previous segments. So moving down to (0,2) won't collide as it's a new position.

Similarly, moving down again to (0,1) won't collide.

Thus, this path works: 7 moves.

Alternatively, going DOWN first might be more efficient, but I'm not sure. Let me see:

Move 1: DOWN → (4,1). Safe.

Move 2: LEFT → (3,1). Safe.

Move 3: LEFT → (2,1). Safe.

Move 4: LEFT → (1,1). Safe.

Move 5: LEFT → (0,1). Success. Only 5 moves!

Wait, is that possible? Because after moving DOWN once and then four times LEFT, we'd reach the apple in 5 moves.

But wait, can we do that without colliding with our own body?

Let me simulate:

Initial position: head at (4,2), body follows as per original.

Move 1: DOWN to (4,1). Body updates: insert (4,2) at front of [ (3,2), ... ] and remove last element. So body becomes [ (4,2), (3,2), ..., (4,4) ] without the last (5,4).

Move 2: LEFT to (3,1). Body updates: insert (4,1) at front → [ (4,1), (4,2), ... , (4,4) ], then remove last element. So body is [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), ..., (4,5) ]? Wait no—original after first move was [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) ]. After inserting (4,1), it's 8 elements; remove last (4,4), so body is [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) ].

So now the body extends from (4,1) up to (4,5).

Move 3: LEFT → (3,1). Wait no—after move 2, we're at (3,1). Then move 3 would be moving LEFT again to (2,1).

But when moving from (3,1), the body is [ (4,1), ... ] so (2,1) isn't part of the body.

Similarly, moving further left:

Move 4: LEFT → (2,1). Safe.

Move 5: LEFT → (1,1). Safe.

Move 6: LEFT → (0,1). Success in 6 moves? Wait no—because from (4,1) to (3,1) is move 2, then each subsequent left is one move. So:

Move 1: DOWN → (4,1).

Move 2: LEFT → (3,1).

Move 3: LEFT → (2,1).

Move 4: LEFT → (1,1).

Move 5: LEFT → (0,1). Total of 5 moves.

Yes, that's correct. So this path is shorter—only five moves. But wait, in move 2, when you move from (4,1) to (3,1), does the body block it? Because after moving DOWN, the body is [ (4,1), (4,2), ... ].

Wait no—the first move was DOWN to (4,1), which caused the body to become [ (4,2), (3,2), ..., (4,5) ] without the last element. Then when you move LEFT to (3,1), you insert (4,1) at front and remove last.

Wait, I'm getting confused with the exact body positions after each move.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that moving DOWN first allows a shorter path of five moves, whereas going UP first requires seven moves. So the optimal path is to go DOWN then LEFT four times.

But wait, when you go DOWN once and then four LEFTs, you reach (0,1) in five moves. Is this correct?

Yes, because each move after the initial DOWN is a LEFT towards the target.

Therefore, the step-by-step explanation would be:

First, move DOWN to (4,1).

Then, move LEFT four times: from (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (0,1).

This is a total of five moves.

But wait—can you make the first move DOWN and then four LEFTs? Yes, because each move changes direction but doesn't reverse, so no collision with body except at the tail.

So in conclusion, the shortest path requires moving DOWN once, then LEFT four times to reach the apple.
</think>

To get to the apple located at (0,1) from the initial position at (4,2), follow these steps:

1. **Move Down** to (4,1).
2. **Move Left** to (3,1).
3. **Move Left** to (2,1).
4. **Move Left** to (1,1).
5. **Move Left** to (0,1).

This sequence ensures you reach the apple in five moves without colliding with your own body.

$\boxed{\text{Move Down then Left four times}}$
