========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

 {
      "moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "UP", "RIGHT"],
      "reasoning": "The snake's head is currently at (9,1) and the apple is located at (2,7). To reach the apple safely, we will first move 'DOWN' to avoid immediate collision with the wall. Next, we move 'LEFT' to gradually move towards the apple without colliding with the snake's body or walls. We then move 'UP' as the next step as it brings us closer to the apple while keeping a safe distance from obstacles. Lastly, we move 'RIGHT' to reach the apple position (2,7). This path ensures the snake remains continuous and avoids collisions."
