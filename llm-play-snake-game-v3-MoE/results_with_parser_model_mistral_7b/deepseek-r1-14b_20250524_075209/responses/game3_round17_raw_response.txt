========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

Okay, I need to figure out how to get the snake's head from (8,2) to eat the apple at (9,2). Let's start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (8,2), and it's currently moving up. The body has one segment at (8,1). So the full snake is [(8,2), (8,1)]. The apple is just to the right of the head at (9,2).

First, I should check if the current direction restricts my next move. Since the current direction is "UP", I can't go down on the first move because that would reverse the direction.

Looking at the head's position and the apple, moving right would directly get me to the apple. But wait, after moving right, what happens next?

If I choose "RIGHT" as my first move, the new head will be (9,2), which is exactly where the apple is. That's great because it means the snake will eat the apple and grow.

But before that, I need to ensure this move doesn't cause a collision. The body is at (8,1). Since the new head is (9,2), which isn't part of the body except possibly the tail. But in this case, since the body is only one segment, moving right wouldn't collide with any body parts.

After eating the apple, the snake's body will grow by one segment. So the new body list would be [(8,2)] because we insert the old head at the front and don't remove the tail.

Now, I need to make sure that after eating the apple, there is at least one legal move next turn. Since the apple is eaten in this first move, the snake's length increases, but the new position allows movement in other directions without immediate collision risk.

So moving "RIGHT" seems safe and efficient.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The head moves directly to the right to reach the apple at (9,2) without colliding with any body segments."
}
```
