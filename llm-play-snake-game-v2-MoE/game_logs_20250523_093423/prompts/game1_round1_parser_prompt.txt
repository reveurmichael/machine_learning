BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>We are given snake head at (5, 5), body cells: [] (empty list). Current direction: NONE. Apple position: (5, 1). We need to plan safe path for the head to reach apple without collisions with wall or body, and then after eating apple, ensure that there is one legal move afterwards. Also constraint "Must not reverse direction on first move" but since current direction is none, any move is allowed.

Let's check details: The snake is at (5, 5) and apple is at (5, 1). That means the offset in x is same: x remains 5 vs 5. y coordinate difference from head to apple is 1 - 5 = -4, so we need 4 moves downward to reach apple.

We also have that valid directions are only "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". We can't reverse direction on first move; but initial direction is none so any allowed move is allowed. However, the constraint "Must not reverse direction" means if you choose a direction (say UP), then next move cannot be DOWN because that's exactly reversed.

But note that our target apple requires moving only in vertical direction downward from head. But must check that if we try to go directly down 4 times? Let's see: The coordinates: starting at (5,5). If we do "DOWN", new head becomes (5,4) then (5,3), then (5,2) and finally (5,1). So it might be possible. But must check that snake does not run into body or wall? Snake's body is empty (no segments), grid boundaries: grid is 10x10 from coordinate (0,0) to (9,9). The path from (5,5) downward will have coordinates:
- After first move "DOWN": head becomes (5,4)
- second move: (5,3)
- third move: (5,2)
- fourth move: (5,1) apple position. And after eating apple, snake grows by one segment and does not remove tail.
But we must check the constraints on final position after apple eaten? Actually instructions mention "After eating the apple, avoid traps--ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." That means that if we plan to stop right when reaching apple? But in our scenario, since we are planning a safe path for the head to reach apple. However, it doesn't require that we simulate moves after apple eaten because instructions mention "Plan a safe path for the head now at (5, 5) to eat the apple" so only need to deliver move sequence up to reaching apple.

But wait: There's an additional constraint "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." That means that after arriving at apple, you want to ensure that snake can then make another move? But we are not required to simulate further moves, just need a safe path plan. It might be sufficient if the planned sequence of moves leaves the snake in a position where it has at least one legal move option, i.e. not trapped.

Let's check after reaching apple: If snake head is at (5,1) with an empty body? But wait, what's the snake configuration now? After eating apple: The snake head is at (5,1), and the old head becomes a new body segment (at (5,5)) so the snake has one segment from (5,5)? Actually check rules:
Snake movement update per move:
- New head = head + direction.
- Head becomes body segment.
- Tail is removed unless apple is eaten in which case tail remains.

Wait: But careful: The body cells given are not including the head. So at start snake's body is empty. When we simulate moves, after each move, new head gets appended to body list and tail removal or not happens depending on if apple is eaten.
But I'm not required to simulate further move choices but only need to provide sequence that ensures one legal move afterwards.

I must consider possibility of immediate collision? But there's no body segments so it's safe. Let me check each step:
- Starting at (5, 5) with no body cells. If we choose "DOWN" as first move: new head = (5,4), then the snake becomes [body now includes old head (5,5)? Actually rule: after moving, snake's body includes previous head position? Typically in Snake, when you move, the head is added and tail removed if not eating apple. But instructions say "head becomes body segment". So initial state: snake head at (5,5), body list empty.
Then simulation:
First move: new head = (5,4). New body = [ (5,5) ]? Actually it's a bit ambiguous: They said "body cells" are positions occupied by snake's body excluding the head. So initial state is head and then no tail segments. But if you move, the old head becomes one of these segments.
So after first move: head at (5,4), body = [(5,5)]. Then second move: new head = (5,3). Now, snake's body becomes [ (5,5), (5,4) ]? And so on.

We must also check collisions. The only possible collision risk is the tail segment but since apple isn't eaten until last move, each time the tail will be removed and only one body cell remains from previous moves because no growth occurs before final move. Wait, let me simulate moves if we go directly down.
Step 1: At (5,5) with empty body, choose "DOWN". New head becomes (5,4). The snake's body now gets the old head as segment? But then tail removal happens? Actually instructions say: "Snake movement update (per move): New head = head + direction; Head becomes body segment; Tail is removed unless apple is eaten." So after first move, if not eating apple, we remove tail. But since snake's body was empty initially, adding the old head would result in a new body list? But then removing tail doesn't change anything because there's no tail to remove? I'm not fully sure but it should be safe.

Let's simulate carefully:
Initial: Head = (5,5); Body = [].
Move 1: "DOWN". New head becomes (5+0,5-1) = (5,4). Then new body includes previous head (which is now a segment) if we assume that. But then tail removal occurs? Because snake's length is one segment more than before? Actually normally if you move and not eat apple, the new head is added at front, then tail is removed to keep same length. The instructions say: "Snake movement update (per move): New head = head + direction; Head becomes body segment; Tail is removed unless apple is eaten." So that means after each move, snake's new head gets appended as a new body segment (i.e., the previous head now becomes part of body) and then tail removal happens. But if initial body was empty, then after first move, you add old head to body list. Then remove tail? Wait, how many segments does snake have initially? It has only one segment (the head). So when moving without eating apple, the snake's length remains 1 always because we add a new head and remove tail leaving total count = 1. But then what is stored as "body cells"? They are positions of body excluding the head, so if snake length is 1, there are no body segments. Let me check: initial snake has just one cell (the head) at (5,5). After first move:
- new head becomes (5,4)
- then previous head becomes a body segment? But tail removal then removes that same segment because the snake's length should remain 1. So effectively after first move, snake remains with head = (5,4) and no other segments if it hasn't eaten apple.

But wait, instructions say: "Snake movement update (per move): New head = head + direction; Head becomes body segment." But then they mention tail removal unless apple is eaten. Let's parse that carefully:
"1. Snake movement update (per move):
   * New head = head + direction
   * Head becomes body segment
   * Tail is removed **unless** apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains)
"
That suggests if you don't eat an apple, the snake's new configuration after a move will have its old head become one of the body segments, and then the tail segment (which would be at the end of the body list) gets removed. So overall, length is maintained constant if no growth occurs.

But initial condition: snake is one cell long (only head). Then after first move, we add the old head to body, making body = [(5,5)] and head becomes (5,4), then tail removal will remove that same segment because there's only one segment. But which order? Possibly the sequence is: new head = (5,4); then append previous head as a body segment; then remove tail from the end of the snake's body list. But if you do that, if body had 0 segments initially, after appending we get [old head] and then removing tail gives [] because there's only one element which is at both beginning and end? There's ambiguity.
I think it's simpler: In a move without eating apple, the snake's position updates such that the new head becomes (x,y) and the rest of the body remains unchanged except that the last segment is removed. But if initial snake had length 1, then after moving, it remains length 1, with head at new position and no other segments.

For our purpose: There's no collision risk because snake has no body segments (except possibly in intermediate moves). Let's simulate using a typical snake simulation:
- Start: Head = (5,5), Body = [].
Move "DOWN": New head becomes (5,4) and then tail removal happens. The new configuration is: Head = (5,4); Body = [] because the old head becomes part of body but then removed as tail? I'm not 100% sure how simulation works, but typically in snake simulation when you move without apple consumption, the length stays same. In many representations, we have a list that stores positions in order with head at index 0. But instructions are ambiguous.

Let's consider it as: After each move, the new head position is computed. Then if an apple wasn't eaten, then remove tail segment (which is the last element of the snake) to maintain same length. So initial snake has only one element (the head). When moving, you compute new head and then add that to list? But then remove tail? That might be a circular update.
Alternatively, we can consider that the snake's body will always have exactly as many segments as the snake had before move if apple wasn't eaten. Initially it is 1. So after each move without eating apple, you'll get a new head and same number of body segments (which may include old positions). But instructions say "Head becomes body segment" which implies that the previous head's position is now in the body list. So then tail removal removes one element from the snake list to maintain length constant if no apple was eaten.

I think it doesn't matter for our path planning because there are no obstacles except walls, and since snake's body remains behind, but they might come into play if apple wasn't eaten until last move, however snake's new configuration is known. But we assume safe moves.

Let's simulate with direct downward movement:
Move 1: "DOWN": head becomes (5,4), new body? If previous head is appended then tail removed, result likely remains length=1. So no collision risk.
Then apple location: (5,1) is lower than head by 3 steps from now?
Wait let's recalc: after move 1, snake head = (5,4). Next moves "DOWN" would be:
Move 2: "DOWN": head becomes (5,3), then tail removal maintains snake length.
Move 3: "DOWN": head becomes (5,2).
Move 4: "DOWN": head becomes (5,1) and apple is at (5,1). When reaching apple, we haven't collided with any obstacles because grid boundaries are not hit. 
But wait, check grid boundaries? All coordinates from y=1 to y=5 are within grid boundaries.
Check potential collisions: The snake's body segments after move 3 might be the positions that were head previously (maybe (5,4), (5,3), ... but then tail removal may remove the oldest segment if any). But anyway safe.

But wait, there is a constraint "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." So after finishing the sequence with final move reaching apple, we need to ensure that at least one legal move exists from the new configuration. Let's check: After move 4, snake head becomes (5,1). Now the snake's body would be updated. But which positions are in the snake? Let's simulate carefully:
Initial state: S = [head: (5,5)]. 
Move "DOWN" simulation if we assume standard snake rules for a one-segment snake without growth until apple is eaten:

Let's denote snake as list of coordinates with head at index 0. Initially: S = [(5,5)].
After each move without eating apple, new state becomes:
S_new[0] = new head; S_new[i] for i>0 = previous S[i-1]. And then if length is constant? Actually typically snake's length remains same if no apple eaten. But the instructions "head becomes body segment" but then "tail is removed" implies that you shift the list and remove tail.
We can simulate:
Initial: [ (5,5) ] 
Move 1: new head = (5,4). Then old head appended to list gives [(5,5)], then remove tail. But if we do append first then removal? In a typical snake with constant length L, the update is S[0] = new head; for i from 0 to L-1, S[i] = previous S[i-1] (with S[-1]= old tail). Then S[L-1] becomes removed. But since initial list has length 1, after moving, you add a new head and then remove the last element. But if we do that in order: Start with [ (5,5) ]. New head = (5,4). Then update body segments by shifting? Actually simpler: The snake remains at length 1 always because when moving without apple, the tail segment is removed.
So after move 1: S = [(5,4)].
After move 2: new head = (5,3), then S becomes [(5,3)].
After move 3: new head = (5,2), then S becomes [(5,2)].
After move 4: new head = (5,1) and apple is eaten so no tail removal. So final snake configuration after finishing the sequence: S = [(5,1)]. There's no other segments because it was only one segment initially. Therefore, from that state, possible moves? The snake can move in any direction except maybe going into wall? But now head is at (5,1). Let's check legal moves:
- If move "UP": new head = (5,2) which is free.
- If move "RIGHT" or "LEFT", not colliding with body because there is no other segment. 
However, we must be careful: if we have just eaten an apple, the snake does not remove tail as per instructions, so length becomes 2. But wait, let's check: Actually instruction says "Tail is removed unless apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains)". That implies that when you eat an apple, the snake grows by one segment because you do not remove the tail. So if you start with a snake of length 1 and then after eating an apple, its length becomes 2.
Let's simulate properly for the apple-eating move:
Before move 4: snake configuration S = [(5,2)]? Let me re-simulate carefully from beginning:
Define snake as list where index0 is head. Initially: S = [(5,5)] (length=1).
Move 1 ("DOWN"): new head = (5+0,5-1) = (5,4). Then update body segments by shifting the old head into a new position? Actually standard update for snake when not eating apple:
S_new[0] = new head.
For each i from 1 to L: S_new[i] = S[i-1]. But then if you want to keep length constant, you remove the last element (which is now duplicated).
But initial S has length 1. So after move, S becomes:
S_new[0] = (5,4). And then for i=1, S_new[i] = previous S[0]? But then you remove tail?
Wait, let me simulate standard snake logic: The snake's body is represented as a queue where the head is added and the tail is removed. Initially S = [(5,5)]. 
When moving:
New head computed.
Then if not eating apple, pop from tail, so result remains same length? But that doesn't work because then you lose the old head which should become new body segment.
Actually, standard logic: The snake's body moves forward. For each move without eating apple, every cell moves to the next position in order, and a new head is added at the front, and then the last element (tail) is removed.
For example, if S = [A, B, C] with A=head, B=body, C=tail, then after moving, new state becomes: new head D; then body cells become A, B, C? But then remove tail means drop C. So final becomes [D, A, B]. 
Now if snake length is 1 initially, S = [ (5,5) ].
After move "DOWN": new head = (5,4). Then update: for each cell from tail to head, shift one position forward:
S[0] = new head (5,4)
Since initial had only one element, there's no other element? Actually maybe we consider that if snake length is 1, then after moving it remains length 1 with just the head.
So S becomes [(5,4)].
After move "DOWN": new head = (5,3). Then update: S becomes [(5,3)].
After move "DOWN": new head = (5,2). Then update: S becomes [(5,2)].
Now after move 4 ("DOWN"): new head would be computed as (5,1) and then since apple is eaten, we do not remove tail. So snake grows by one segment:
So S becomes [new head (5,1), old head (5,2)].
Thus final configuration: Head = (5,1), Body = [(5,2)]. 
Then check legal moves from final state:
Possible directions from head (5,1):
- "UP": new head becomes (5,2) but that's occupied by body.
- "RIGHT": new head becomes (6,1) free if not wall and not in snake? But might be out-of-bound if grid width is maybe 10? Not given so assume infinite or sufficiently large.
- "LEFT": new head becomes (4,1), which is free if grid boundaries are assumed to be large enough.
- "DOWN": new head would become (5,0) but check: If grid y coordinate starts at 0 then that might be illegal. But instructions did not specify grid dimensions explicitly, maybe assume infinite grid or a fixed grid? Possibly assume 10x10? But the text "if no apple is eaten, snake moves in same direction and tail removal occurs" suggests there's a board with boundaries.
We can check collisions: The snake has body (5,2) which is exactly one step up from head if head goes upward. So upward move would result in collision with body cell at (5,2). Therefore that move is illegal.
So legal moves might be "RIGHT" or "LEFT", as long as they are not walls and do not lead to collision with snake's body. 
We should check: Does the snake have any other body segments? It has only one segment after growth, so it doesn't block left/right if no obstacles exist.

Therefore, final configuration is safe because there is at least one legal move from (5,1): either right or left, provided they are not blocked by wall boundaries. We must check walls: The snake's head is at (5,1) now. If grid boundaries are considered, then for a typical board, if we assume board has a minimum coordinate of 0 and maximum maybe something like 9, then from (5,1), "DOWN" would be (5,0) which might be legal if board min y=0. But "UP" is illegal because (5,2) is occupied by the body. So that's fine.

But wait, check collisions: Actually, what about if we consider a grid with boundaries? The instructions mention walls as collisions; so if snake goes out-of-bound, that's collision. But it doesn't matter for our planning since we only need one legal move after apple eaten. In many snake games, the board is often assumed to be larger than the snake's position. We can assume a safe grid.
Thus direct downward path seems valid.

However, we have to consider the additional constraint "if possible, always avoid traps by choosing moves that keep at least two directions available." And also: "If there is an apple in reach and no immediate risk of collision, then choose that move" but only if the move doesn't cause a trap.
We must check for potential traps. The instructions say: "if possible, always avoid moves that leave you with no legal moves after the move." 
Let's analyze each potential move from initial state:
Possible directions: "UP", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "LEFT".
- "UP": from (5,5) to (5,6). Then snake becomes [head=(5,6)] if not apple. But wait, there is an apple at (5,1), which is far away. But our target apple is at (5,1) and is reachable by going down repeatedly.
- "RIGHT": from (5,5) to (6,5).
- "DOWN": direct route to apple: (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2) and then final move to apple. But wait, if we go directly downward without deviation, is there any risk of trapping? Let's check: after the first few moves, snake's configuration might cause some traps because snake's body follows behind.
Let’s simulate potential sequences:
We want to reach apple at (5,1). The most direct route is just going down continuously. But as we simulated, it seems safe because the snake's body doesn't block the downward path and eventually, after the final move, there's one legal move available (left or right). But check: if we choose "DOWN" repeatedly, what happens at each step:
Step 1: "DOWN": head becomes (5,4); configuration S = [ (5,4) ].
Step 2: "DOWN": head becomes (5,3); config remains a single segment because no apple eaten.
Step 3: "DOWN": head becomes (5,2); config remains single segment because no apple eaten.
Step 4: "DOWN": head becomes (5,1) and apple is eaten, so snake grows to length=2 with body = [(5,2)].
Now check possible moves from final configuration:
From (5,1), if we go "UP", new head becomes (5,2) which collides with body cell (5,2). So that's not allowed. But what about going "DOWN"? If grid boundaries allow it, then (5,0) is free because snake has length 2 and the only occupied cell is (5,2), so down is legal if not out-of-bound.
Also "LEFT" from (5,1): becomes (4,1) which is likely free. And "RIGHT": becomes (6,1) also free.
So there are at least three legal moves after final move. But wait, could it be a trap? The instructions say: "if possible, always avoid traps by choosing moves that keep at least two directions available." Our final state with only one segment of body might have only 2 open directions if the snake is adjacent to wall?
We must check board boundaries. We are not given explicit grid dimensions, but we can assume a sufficiently large grid such that from (5,1), going up is blocked by snake's body, but left/right/down are available. But what about "DOWN": if grid lower bound is 0 and current y=1, then down becomes (5,0) which should be legal as long as not out-of-bound.
But maybe we assume a board of size 10x10? Then coordinates range from 0 to 9. The snake's head at (5,1) has available moves: up is blocked by body, left is free if x>0, right is free if x<9, and down is free if y>0 which it is.
So that works.

Now consider alternative moves:
- "LEFT" from start would lead to snake's head at (4,5). That path does not bring us closer to apple because apple is at (5,1) so maybe it's a detour. But we must check if any immediate collision risk.
- "RIGHT": similar as left, but less direct.
- "UP": goes away from the apple.

Since the apple is in reach and on a clear path downwards, and there are no obstacles mentioned, the best move should be to go "DOWN" immediately because it takes you directly towards the apple with no risk of immediate collision. The instructions: "if there is an apple in reach and no immediate risk of collision, then choose that move." And "immediate risk of collision" means if moving in that direction would cause your snake's head to be adjacent to any walls or other snakes. However, nothing indicates that going down from (5,5) is dangerous because the board boundaries are not near.
We need to check: When heading down, do we need to worry about colliding with our own tail? Our snake currently has no body apart from the head at (5,5). And going directly downward, your path will cover cells that haven't been occupied by your snake's body because it was always moving and then being removed. The snake is essentially a point that leaves behind no trail because its length is 1. So that seems safe.
However, what about potential traps? The instructions say "if possible, always avoid moves that leave you with no legal moves after the move." We should check if going down eventually traps us. But given our simulation, after the final apple-eating move, we have at least three legal moves (left, right, and possibly down). However, what about potential collisions with walls? The board boundaries are not specified but we assume a sufficiently large grid.
We must also consider possible self-collision from the body if it becomes longer. But since our snake starts with length 1, going in one direction will not cause immediate collision because there's no occupied cell behind.
Thus, "DOWN" is safe.

What about trap avoidance? The instructions say "if you have an apple within reach, then go for it." So we can choose to move down because it's the most direct approach and it doesn't risk collisions with walls or snake bodies. 
However, let’s check: After moving "DOWN", our head goes from (5,5) to (5,4). But could that potentially cause a trap? The potential trap could be if our body were behind us in such a way that one move blocks multiple directions. But here, since the snake is length 1 and we are moving straight down, there's no danger of trapping ourselves because the path we will travel is free.
What about if board boundaries are near? Possibly not.

Let’s simulate alternative directions quickly:
- If we go "DOWN", route: (5,4), then (5,3), then (5,2), then apple at (5,1) is reached. The snake remains safe because no collisions occur along that path. And after the final move, available moves are left/right/down.
- If we go any other direction initially, maybe "DOWN" and then later "UP"? That would lead to self-collision likely.
Thus, going straight down seems optimal.

I worry about potential traps if snake becomes length 2 with tail at (5,2) after apple eaten. But that's not a trap because you'll have three moves available.
Let’s check: With final configuration S = [(5,1), (5,2)], what are the legal moves?
From head (5,1):
- "UP": would result in new head (5,2) which is occupied by tail, illegal.
- "DOWN": results in (5,0). That cell is not part of snake if board boundaries allow. It's safe.
- "LEFT": results in (4,1), safe provided it's within bounds.
- "RIGHT": results in (6,1), safe as long as board boundaries are not near.
So at least two directions remain legal: left and right, even though up is blocked by the tail. So that's fine.

Also check if moving "DOWN" initially might cause collision with a wall if board bottom is 0? Possibly not because (5,1) to (5,0) is safe if grid minimum y=0.
But wait: what if board boundaries are such that the snake is near a wall? The problem doesn't specify and we assume there's no immediate risk unless it says so.

I must also consider "if possible, always avoid moves that leave you with no legal moves after the move." Let's check what happens if the snake becomes longer. But since our snake starts at (5,5) and apple is at (5,1), going down seems to be the most straightforward route.
Potential alternative: if we had started with a snake of length 0? Actually, it says "if there is an apple in reach and no immediate risk", then choose that move. Here, the apple is not on adjacent cell because apple is at (5,1) which is two cells down from current head (5,5)? Wait, check: Current position is (5,5), apple is at (5,1). So difference in y coordinate is 4, so it's reachable by going directly down repeatedly. But wait, if the snake length were more than 0 and we had a body behind us, could that cause collision?
The instructions say "avoid traps" which means moves that leave you with no legal moves after the move. If there is an apple in reach and no immediate risk of collision, then choose that move.
So indeed, the best move is to go directly toward the apple.

Thus answer: "DOWN"

But let me check if any potential trap exists from going down straight:
Consider potential collisions: The snake's body is not yet formed because it's only one segment. So going in a single direction will never cause collision with itself as long as the board boundaries are not immediate.
I also need to consider that sometimes going directly for an apple can be risky if there are other snakes or walls, but instructions don't mention any other snake positions or walls aside from the apple's location and our snake's own position. So I assume it's safe.

Thus answer: "DOWN"

I'll output "DOWN". So final move should be "DOWN".

I'll now produce my final answer accordingly.</think>Based on the current situation, here’s how we analyze the decision:

1. Our snake is at (5,5) and has no body segments behind it yet. The apple is located at (5,1), which means that if we move directly downward repeatedly (“DOWN”), we will pass through clear cells: first to (5,4), then (5,3), then (5,2) before reaching the apple.

2. Since our snake has no body parts trailing behind it (its length is 1 at the start), moving straight down won’t cause any immediate self-collision. In addition, none of those cells are blocked by walls or other snakes as per the provided information.

3. The strategy guidelines tell us to “if there is an apple in reach and no immediate risk of collision, then choose that move” and also to “avoid moves that leave you with no legal moves after the move.” After we eat the apple at (5,1), our snake grows by one segment. In that final configuration, although moving “UP” would lead into the tail (now at (5,2)), there will be other directions (such as “LEFT”, “RIGHT”, and possibly “DOWN”) available—so we won’t trap ourselves.

4. Alternative moves like “UP,” “LEFT,” or “RIGHT” from our starting position do not bring us closer to the apple and could potentially lead into a situation where fewer escape routes are available later on.

Thus, moving “DOWN” is both safe (no immediate collision risk) and optimal (directly targets the apple while leaving room for future maneuvers).

The best move in this turn is: DOWN.

- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
