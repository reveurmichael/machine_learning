========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake is at (6,0), and the apple is also at (6,0). Wait, that's the same position as the head. So if I move into it, the snake will eat the apple and grow.

But wait, according to the problem statement, the apple is at (6,0), which is the same as the head's current position. Hmm, that seems a bit odd because the head can't be on the apple unless it just ate it. But maybe in this scenario, the apple is already there, and the snake needs to move into it.

The current direction is "DOWN". So from (6,0), moving down would take the head out of the grid since y decreases further, but y=0 is the bottom row. Wait, no—moving down from (6,0) would take us to (6,-1), which is outside the grid. That's not allowed because it causes the snake to die.

So if the current direction is DOWN, and the head is at (6,0), moving in any other direction except NONE would be possible since we can't reverse. Wait, no—the movement rules say that you cannot reverse the direction on the next move. So since current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP.

So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN? No, wait: current direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP because they're opposite. So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE if it's the first move after starting.

Wait, but in this case, moving DOWN would take us out of bounds, which causes death. So we can't do that. So possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT.

Looking at the body: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]. The snake is currently going down because the head is at (6,0) and the next segment is (6,1). So it's a straight line upwards along x=6 from y=0 to y=3.

So if I move LEFT or RIGHT, let's see what happens.

If I choose LEFT, new_head becomes (5,0). Now check for collisions: is (5,0) occupied by any body segment except the tail?

The body is [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3)], so none of these are at (5,0). So no collision. Then, since new_head is not the apple's position (apple is at (6,0)), we don't grow. Wait, but wait—the apple is at (6,0), which is where the head is currently. So if I move into a direction and land on (6,0), that would be eating the apple.

Wait no: the current head is already on the apple. So does moving cause it to eat? Or do we have to make a movement step?

I think in this case, since the head is already at the apple's position, moving any direction and then checking if new_head equals apple position would not trigger eating because new_head is different.

Wait no—the apple is at (6,0), same as the current head. So when I move, say, LEFT to (5,0), that would make me eat the apple since it's now the new head? Or does the movement step happen first, and then checking for eating?

Wait according to the movement update rules:

1. Compute new_head based on direction.
2. Check collisions: if new_head is outside grid or collides with body except possibly tail when tail moves.
3. If no collision, proceed to update body.

Then, during the update, check if new_head == apple position. So in this case, since new_head is (5,0), which is not equal to apple's position (6,0), so we don't eat it. Wait but that can't be right because the apple is at (6,0). Hmm.

Wait no: The apple is at (6,0), same as the head's initial position. So when I make a move, say LEFT, new_head becomes (5,0). Then, since new_head != apple position, we don't eat it, and proceed normally.

But wait—the apple is already eaten by the head because they're in the same spot. Or perhaps the apple is considered as not being eaten unless the movement leads to the new_head being on it.

This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the rules.

In the movement update rule step 3: if new_head == apple position, grow.

So if I move into (6,0), which is where the head is already, that's not possible because new_head would be same as current head, but movement changes the head position.

Wait no—the movement computes new_head as head + direction. So if direction is NONE, perhaps the snake doesn't move. But in this case, direction can't be NONE unless it's the first step.

Wait, initial direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP. Possible moves are LEFT and RIGHT.

So let's proceed:

If I choose to move LEFT from (6,0), new_head becomes (5,0). Apple is at (6,0), which is different, so no eating.

Then, body updates: insert old head (6,0) into the front of BODY. The current BODY is [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3)], so after inserting, it becomes [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]. Then, since we didn't eat the apple, remove the tail (which is (6,3)).

So new BODY is [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2)], and head is now (5,0).

Then, in next step, where can I move?

Current direction is LEFT (from first move). Next move cannot be RIGHT because that's the opposite. So possible directions are DOWN, UP, or NONE.

Wait, but wait: movement rules say you can't reverse direction. So if current direction after first move is LEFT, then next move can't be RIGHT. So from LEFT, next move can be any except RIGHT.

So in this case, after moving LEFT to (5,0), the next directions could be UP, DOWN, or NONE.

But let's see what happens when I eat the apple:

Wait, but if I'm at (6,0) and choose to not move (direction NONE?), that would make me stay. But according to movement rules, direction can't be NONE unless it's the first move after starting. Wait, initial direction is DOWN, so next moves have to follow the no-reverse rule.

Wait this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, since the apple is at (6,0), which is where the head is already. So if I choose to not move, but that's only possible if current direction allows it. But the initial direction is DOWN, so first move can't be UP or NONE? Or wait: the movement rules say that if the current direction is NONE, any first move is allowed.

Wait in this case, initial direction is DOWN, so next moves have to follow no-reverse.

But maybe I should think about how to make the snake eat the apple. Since the apple is already under the head, perhaps moving in a way that causes the new_head to land on it isn't possible because it's already there. Or perhaps the movement step will cause the head to stay and eat the apple.

Wait no: movement changes the position based on direction. So if I choose NONE as direction (which is possible only if current direction is NONE, which it isn't here), but since current direction is DOWN, choosing NONE might not be allowed except for the first move.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the snake can eat the apple without moving because the head is already on it. But according to the rules, I think movement is required; you have to compute new_head based on direction. So if direction is NONE, the head doesn't move.

Wait no: looking back, D is the direction vector. The direction can be "NONE", but in that case, dx and dy would be (0,0). So new_head remains same as head.

In this case, since current direction is DOWN, I can choose to change direction or keep it. But movement direction can't reverse.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

The apple is at the same position as the snake's head. So perhaps moving in any other direction except those that cause collision would allow the snake to eat the apple when it moves back.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that since the head and apple are already on the same cell, the move is possible without changing direction because the new_head will still be on the apple.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the best approach is to make a single move that doesn't cause collision and then check if it's safe.

Given that, moving LEFT seems safe because (5,0) isn't blocked by any body segments except perhaps when the tail moves. Let me see:

Body before movement: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3)].

After moving LEFT, new_head is (5,0). Then, old head (6,0) is added to the front of BODY, making it [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]. Since we didn't eat apple, we remove tail (6,3). So new body is [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2)].

Then, head is at (5,0). Next move needs to be planned.

But since the apple is at (6,0), perhaps moving RIGHT from (5,0) would take us back there. Let's see:

From (5,0), current direction after first move was LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. So possible directions are DOWN or UP or NONE? No, no: movement rules say you can't reverse direction. Current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT.

So from LEFT, next moves can be any except RIGHT. Let's choose to move DOWN.

But moving DOWN from (5,0) would take us to (5,-1), which is out of bounds—death. So not allowed.

Alternatively, move UP: to (5,1). Then check if that causes collision with body segments except the tail when it moves.

Body after first move was [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2)]. Moving UP to (5,1) would make new_head (5,1). Check if any body segments are at (5,1). The current body is [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2)], so no. So safe.

Then, since new_head != apple's position (6,0), we proceed normally: insert old head (5,0) into front of BODY, making it [(5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)]. Then remove tail (6,2). New body is [(5,0), (6,0), (6,1)].

But I'm getting further away from the apple. Maybe a better approach is to make two moves: first move LEFT to (5,0), then next move RIGHT back to (6,0) and eat the apple.

Wait, but after moving LEFT, current direction is LEFT. So next move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing. So I can't do that.

Alternatively, after moving LEFT, choose a different direction for the next move that doesn't reverse.

But perhaps it's better to think of just making one move: from (6,0), choosing NONE as direction so head stays at (6,0) and eats apple.

Wait but current direction is DOWN. So can I choose NONE as next direction? According to movement rules, you can only choose NONE if the current direction was NONE. Here, it's not. So I think NO.

So perhaps the correct move is to change direction from DOWN to LEFT or RIGHT without reversing.

But given that, moving LEFT seems safe, so the first step would be to move LEFT, which doesn't collide and keeps the snake alive.

Thus, the answer should be moving LEFT.
</think>

The snake's head is at (6,0), same as the apple. Moving LEFT to (5,0) is safe and allows avoiding collision while planning the next steps to eat the apple.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Current Position**: The snake's head is at (6,0), which coincides with the apple's position.
2. **Direction Constraints**: Current direction is DOWN; next move cannot be UP.
3. **Possible Moves**: LEFT or RIGHT without reversing the direction.
4. **Collision Check for LEFT Move**:
   - New_head: (5,0).
   - Body after inserting old head: [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)].
   - Remove tail: [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2)].
   - No collision except possible with the new_head (5,0) not in body segments.
5. **Conclusion**: Moving LEFT is safe.

**Answer**: The snake should move LEFT to (5,0).

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 0) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (6, 0). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
