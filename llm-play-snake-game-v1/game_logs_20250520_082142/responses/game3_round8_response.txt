Let me analyze the current game state and plan a safe path to the apple at (1, 9):

Current situation:
- Snake head at (8,1) facing DOWN (Hâ†“)
- Snake body at (7,1)
- Apple at (1,9)
- Board is 10x10 (0-9 rows and columns)

Constraints:
1. Can't move UP (opposite of current DOWN direction)
2. Must avoid walls and body
3. Need to navigate around the board to reach far apple

Safe path considerations:
- First need to turn RIGHT to start moving horizontally
- Then need to go UP when possible to reach higher rows
- Must leave enough space to turn and avoid walls

Here's my planned sequence of moves (15 moves to reach apple):

1. RIGHT (from current DOWN, can't go UP)
2. RIGHT (now facing right)
3. UP (start moving toward apple row)
4. UP
5. UP
6. UP
7. UP
8. UP (now at row 2)
9. RIGHT
10. RIGHT
11. RIGHT
12. RIGHT
13. RIGHT
14. RIGHT
15. RIGHT (reaches apple at (1,9))

This path:
- First turns right to get away from body
- Then moves up to reach apple's row
- Finally moves right across to the apple
- Avoids walls and body at all times
- Gives enough space for all turns

Alternative paths would either be longer or riskier (like going left first which would corner us). This seems like the most efficient safe path.
