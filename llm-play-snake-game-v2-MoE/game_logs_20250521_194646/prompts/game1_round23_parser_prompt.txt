Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake get to the apple without dying. Let me start by understanding the current situation.

The snake's head is at (2,8), and the apple is at (4,6). The grid is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. That means moving right increases x, and moving up increases y.

The snake's current direction is LEFT. So, it was moving left before, but I need to make sure that the next move doesn't reverse its direction. Wait, no, actually, the direction given is LEFT, so the last movement was to the left, and now the next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse. But wait, rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

But wait, in this case, the current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT. The head is at (2,8). If I go LEFT again from here, that would take it to (1,8), but I have to check if that's safe because of the body.

The body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]. So, let me visualize this. The head is at (2,8). Then the body has a segment at (3,8), which is to the right and same y as the head. Wait, so the snake's body is at (3,7), (4,7), and (3,8). Hmm, that seems a bit scattered.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The head is at (2,8). Then the body cells are in order after the head: first is (4,7), then (3,7), then (3,8). So, the snake's path is from head to tail as follows: (2,8) → ... and then the body segments. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the body cells are given in a list, which probably represents the order behind the head.

So, after the head, the next segment is (4,7), then (3,7), then (3,8). That would form a snake that goes from (2,8) to (4,7) to (3,7) to (3,8). Wait, but how? Because movement usually adds new segments at the head and removes the tail unless it eats an apple.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)], which means that after the head, those positions are occupied by the body. So the snake's path is: (2,8) → ... and then these points.

I need to make sure that when moving, the new head doesn't collide with any of these body cells or go out of bounds.

The apple is at (4,6). From the head's current position (2,8), I need to figure out a path that gets the snake there without hitting itself and without reversing direction initially.

First, let me calculate the Manhattan distance. The x difference is 4-2=2 right, and y difference is 6-8=-2 down. So the Manhattan distance is 4. That means at least four moves are needed.

But I have to plan each step carefully.

Current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. So possible directions for the first move: UP, DOWN, or LEFT again. Or if direction is NONE, but here it's LEFT, so next move can't reverse.

Wait, no: current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT because that would reverse. So from (2,8), the head can move LEFT to (1,8), UP to (2,9) which is out of bounds, or DOWN to (2,7).

Wait, wait, coordinates are (x,y). From (2,8), moving UP increases y by 1, so (2,9) but that's outside the grid since y can only go up to 9? Wait no, because in the example given, (0,0) is bottom-left and (9,9) is top-right. So, coordinates are from (0,0) as the bottom-left corner, so moving UP would increase y. But the grid is 10x10, meaning x ranges 0-9 and y ranges 0-9.

So, from (2,8), moving UP would take it to (2,9), which is valid because y can be up to 9. So, that's a possible move.

But let me think: the head is at (2,8). The apple is at (4,6). So, I need to go right twice and down two times. But the current direction is LEFT, so first move can't be RIGHT; it has to be either UP or DOWN or LEFT again.

Wait, no, the first move can be any direction except the reverse of the current direction. Since current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.

But let's check each possibility:

1. Move LEFT from (2,8) to (1,8). Then, the next move would have to avoid going back to the right if possible.

Wait, but after moving LEFT to (1,8), what are the body cells? The body is at (4,7), (3,7), (3,8). So when I move to (1,8), does that collide with any body cell? Let's see: (1,8) is not in [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)], so it's safe.

But then the next move needs to be towards the apple. From (1,8), I need to go right twice and down two times. But wait, moving from (2,8) left to (1,8), that might not be the most efficient path because now I'm further left than needed.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first would take me closer to the apple's y-coordinate.

Wait, from (2,8), moving DOWN takes y from 8 to 7. So new head at (2,7). Let's check if that position is safe: body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]. So (2,7) isn't in the body, so it's okay.

After moving DOWN, the next move can be any except UP because current direction would now be DOWN. Wait no, wait, movement after each step changes the direction. Let me clarify: each move updates the head and the direction for the next move.

So if I first move DOWN from (2,8) to (2,7), then my new direction is DOWN. So the next move can't be UP.

But wait, no, because movement rules state that after moving in a certain direction, the next move cannot reverse. So if you're moving DOWN, next can't be UP; but other directions are allowed unless blocked by body or walls.

So perhaps starting with DOWN is better.

Let me outline possible paths:

Option 1: Move LEFT first.

From (2,8) → LEFT to (1,8). Then, from there, the direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. So I have to go UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But moving further left might not help because the apple is to the right and down.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN first is better.

Let me think about this step by step.

Current head: (2,8)

Possible moves:

- LEFT → (1,8), direction becomes LEFT
- UP → (2,9), which is valid as y=9 is allowed. Then direction becomes UP.
- DOWN → (2,7), direction becomes DOWN.

I need to find a path that reaches (4,6) without hitting body or walls and ensuring after eating the apple there's at least one move left.

Let me consider each option:

Option 1: Move LEFT first.

Move 1: LEFT → (1,8). New direction is LEFT. Now, next moves can't be RIGHT.

From here, I need to go right twice and down twice. But since the current direction is LEFT, I can't immediately turn around. So from (1,8), possible directions are LEFT again or UP/DOWN.

But moving further left would take me away from the apple's x-coordinate, which is 4, so that's not helpful.

So maybe after moving to (1,8), I need to change direction. But wait, can't reverse direction. So if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. So from (1,8), possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

If I go UP, that's y=9, then perhaps I can start moving right.

But let me see: After (1,8) → move UP to (1,9). Now direction is UP, so next move can't be DOWN.

From there, the snake would need to move RIGHT twice and DOWN two times. But wait, that might complicate things because the body could block the path.

Alternatively, after moving LEFT to (1,8), perhaps the next move should be DOWN.

So:

Move 2: DOWN → (1,7). Now direction is DOWN, so next can't be UP.

From (1,7), need to go right twice and down once more? Wait, no. The apple is at (4,6), which is x=4, y=6. So from (1,8) after moving LEFT, the path would require going right three times and down two times. That's a lot of moves.

Wait, but that might be too long and perhaps hit body cells or walls.

Option 2: Move DOWN first.

Move 1: DOWN → (2,7). Now direction is DOWN.

Next move can't be UP.

From here, I need to go right twice and down once more? Wait, no. From (2,8) to (4,6), x increases by 2, y decreases by 2. So from (2,7), which is after moving DOWN once, I still need to move right two times and down one more time.

Wait, let me check:

After Move 1: (2,7). Then, next moves can be RIGHT twice, then DOWN once, but that would require a total of three moves from here. Wait no, because the first move was DOWN to (2,7), which is already moving y from 8 to 7. So I need to go down two times in total: starting at y=8, after one move, y=7; another move down would take y to 6.

So:

Move 1: DOWN → (2,7)
Move 2: RIGHT → (3,7)
Move 3: RIGHT → (4,7)
Now head is at (4,7), which is the same as one of the body cells. Wait, but that's bad because after moving, the head becomes part of the body, and the previous body segments shift.

Wait, no. The body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]. So if the head moves to (2,7) first, then the new body would be [ (2,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8) ]? Or wait, no. The body cells are given as part of the current state, so when moving, the new head is added, and the tail moves unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, but in this case, the snake hasn't eaten the apple yet, so after each move, the tail would be removed. But since we're planning a path that includes eating the apple, once the apple is eaten, the tail doesn't shrink on the next move.

Hmm, this complicates things.

Let me try to map out the steps with the body in mind.

Current state:

Head: (2,8)
Body cells: [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]
Apple: (4,6)

So, when moving, after each move, the head becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten in that move.

So, let's plan a path step by step:

1. First move from (2,8) with direction LEFT. But as I thought earlier, maybe starting with DOWN is better.

Wait, but let me think about the required number of RIGHT/LEFT and UP/DOWN moves. The problem states that after all moves, the count should match: right moves minus left moves = 4-2=2, down moves minus up moves=8-6=2.

So I need a total of two more rights than lefts, and two more downs than ups.

So in terms of net movement:

RIGHT x2, DOWN x2. But the order can vary as long as these conditions are met.

Now, starting at (2,8), possible first moves: LEFT is current direction, so next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.

Option A: Move DOWN first to (2,7). Now, head is (2,7), body becomes [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]? Or wait, no. When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless apple was eaten.

Wait, in this case, the apple hasn't been eaten yet, so after moving, the tail would be removed.

So initial body: [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]. So when the head moves from (2,8) to a new position, say (x,y), the new body is [new_head] + old_body[:-1], because the tail is removed.

Wait, let me clarify. The body cells are given as [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)], which includes all segments except the head. So when moving, the head becomes part of the body, and the tail is lost unless an apple was eaten in that move.

So after each move where no apple is eaten, the body segments are [new_head] + old_body[:-1].

In this case, since we're planning to eat the apple at (4,6), which hasn't been done yet, so when moving towards it, the tail will be removed each time.

Wait, but in the initial state, the snake's body is [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)], and the head is at (2,8). So the full path of the snake is: head → (2,8) → body segments from (4,7), (3,7), (3,8).

So when moving, for example, from (2,8) to (1,8) via LEFT:

New head is at (1,8). The new body would be [(1,8)] + [current body] without the tail. Wait no: current body is [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)], so when moving, the new body becomes [new_head] + [old_body], and then if not eating apple, remove the last segment.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to model it step by step.

Initial state:

Head: (2,8)
Body: [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]
Tail: ?

So the snake is a list starting with head, then body segments towards tail.

When moving, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten in that move.

But since we haven't eaten the apple yet, each move will cause the tail to be lost.

So let's see:

Move 1: From (2,8) move LEFT to (1,8). Now, the body becomes [(1,8), (4,7), (3,7)] because the tail (3,8) is removed. Wait no, wait: initial body after head is [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]. So when moving to new head (1,8), the new body would be [(1,8), (4,7), (3,7)] because we remove the last segment.

But now, does (1,8) collide with any of the new body segments? The new body after Move 1 is [(1,8), (4,7), (3,7)]. So no collision because (1,8) is the head and isn't in the body.

So after Move 1:

Head: (1,8)
Body: [(4,7), (3,7)]

Now, next move can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

If I go RIGHT now, since current direction is LEFT, that's allowed? Wait no. After moving LEFT to (1,8), the new direction is LEFT. So from here, the next move cannot be RIGHT.

So possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.

Let me try moving RIGHT, but wait, can't because direction is LEFT. So options are UP or DOWN.

Option A: Move DOWN.

Move 2: (1,8) → (1,7). Now direction is DOWN.

Body after move: [(1,7), (4,7), (3,7)] with tail removed, but wait no. Wait, initial body after Move 1 was [(4,7), (3,7)]. So when moving DOWN from (1,8) to (1,7):

New head is (1,7). The new body becomes [(1,7), (4,7), (3,7)].

Now check for collision: (1,7) not in the body except as the head. So safe.

Next move can't be UP since direction is DOWN.

From here, need to reach (4,6).

So, Move 3: from (1,7), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

But moving further down might help towards y=6.

Move 3: DOWN → (1,6). Now direction is DOWN. Body becomes [(1,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

Wait, but the body after Move 2 was [(1,7), (4,7), (3,7)]. So when moving to (1,6), new body is [(1,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

Now, check for collision: (1,6) not in body except as head. Safe.

Move 4: Now direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP. Need to go right towards x=4.

So from (1,6), move RIGHT → (2,6). Direction becomes RIGHT.

Body becomes [(2,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

Now, Move 5: continue moving RIGHT → (3,6). Now direction is RIGHT. Body becomes [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

Move 6: move RIGHT → (4,6). Now we've reached the apple at (4,6).

At this point, since we ate the apple, the body doesn't lose its tail. So new body is [ (4,6) ] + previous body without removing tail? Wait no, when you eat an apple, the tail isn't removed because the snake grows.

So after eating the apple:

Head: (4,6)
Body: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] ??? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, initial body before eating apple was [(3,6), (2,6), ...]?

No, let me retrace.

After Move 5: head is at (3,6). Body after that move would be [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

Then Move 6: move RIGHT to (4,6). Now, since we ate the apple here, the body becomes [(4,6), (3,6), (4,7), (3,7)]. Because we don't remove the tail when eating an apple.

Now, after that, there must be at least one more move. But let's see if this path works without hitting the body.

Wait, but in Move 6, the head is at (4,6). The body before was [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)]. So when moving to (4,6), the new body would be [ (4,6) ] + old_body without removing tail because we ate the apple.

So body becomes [ (4,6), (3,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]. Now, check for collision: head at (4,6) is safe. Next move can't be LEFT since direction is RIGHT.

But wait, when moving to (4,6), the direction is now RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT.

So after eating the apple, we have:

Head: (4,6)
Body: [(3,6), (2,6), ...] Wait no. Let me clarify again.

Actually, each time you move and eat an apple, the body grows by adding a segment at the end without losing the tail. So when moving into (4,6) from (3,6), which was after Move 5: head at (3,6), body is [(2,6), ...].

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try to outline all moves step by step, keeping track of the head and body:

Move 1: LEFT → (1,8)
Body becomes [ (1,8) ] + old_body[:-1] = [ (1,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]
Because tail was removed since no apple eaten.

Move 2: DOWN → (1,7)
Body becomes [ (1,7) ] + old_body[:-1] = [ (1,7), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 3: DOWN → (1,6)
Body becomes [ (1,6) ] + old_body[:-1] = [ (1,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 4: RIGHT → (2,6)
Body becomes [ (2,6) ] + old_body[:-1] = [ (2,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 5: RIGHT → (3,6)
Body becomes [ (3,6) ] + old_body[:-1] = [ (3,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 6: RIGHT → (4,6) → EAT APPLE
Now, body grows. So new body is [ (4,6), (3,6), (4,7), (3,7) ] and the tail isn't removed.

So after Move 6, head is at (4,6), body is [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)].

Now, check for collisions: new head (4,6) not in body except as first element, so no collision.

But now we need to make sure that the next move can be made without hitting the body. So after eating the apple, the direction is RIGHT, and the next move can't be LEFT.

So from (4,6), possible moves are DOWN or UP? Or maybe RIGHT again?

Wait, after moving into (4,6) via RIGHT, the direction is RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT. So options are to move UP or DOWN or RIGHT again.

But we've reached the apple, but perhaps there's a need for another move.

Wait, according to the problem statement, after eating the apple, there must be at least one more move possible. But let me see: in this case, after Move 6, I think that's when the apple is eaten. So the path requires that the snake can make all moves leading up to and including eating the apple without hitting itself.

Wait no, actually, the problem says "You must output a series of moves that leads the head to the position of the apple, with the stipulation that after you have moved into the position of the apple (i.e., after the move that takes the head into the position of the apple), there is at least one more empty square adjacent orthogonally or diagonally (excluding blocked by walls) to the head for the snake to continue moving. So in this case, when the snake's head is at (4,6), we need to ensure that there's an adjacent empty square.

Looking at the current position after eating the apple:

Head: (4,6)
Body: [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)]

So surrounding squares are checked for adjacency. Orthogonal and diagonal.

Check all 8 neighbors of (4,6):

(3,5) - possibly empty
(4,5) - ?
(5,5) - outside grid? Assuming the grid is large enough, but let's say it's okay.
Wait no, perhaps I should consider that after eating, the snake must have at least one adjacent empty square for the next move.

In this case, from (4,6), possible moves:

DOWN → (4,5): check if it's not in body. Body is [(3,6), (4,7), (3,7)], so (4,5) is not present. So yes, possible.

Alternatively, RIGHT is already at the edge? Or maybe there are other possibilities.

So after Move 6, we can make another move. Therefore, this path seems valid.

But wait, did I track all moves correctly?

Move 1: LEFT → (1,8)
Body: [ (1,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Wait no, initial body was [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8)]. So after moving LEFT from (2,8) to (1,8), the new body would be [(1,8), (4,7), (3,7)], because we lose the tail (3,8).

Then Move 2: DOWN → (1,7)
Body becomes [ (1,7), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 3: DOWN → (1,6)
Body becomes [ (1,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 4: RIGHT → (2,6)
Body becomes [ (2,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 5: RIGHT → (3,6)
Body becomes [ (3,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 6: RIGHT → (4,6) → EAT APPLE
Now, body grows. New body is [ (4,6), (3,6), (4,7), (3,7) ].

So the new head is at (4,6). Now, from here, possible moves are:

UP: (4,7) – but that's part of the body.
DOWN: (4,5) – not in body.
LEFT: (3,6) – which is next segment. So can't move LEFT because it would collide with body.

RIGHT: If grid allows, (5,6). Not sure if grid is bounded, but assuming it's allowed, and that square is empty.

But since the problem only requires after eating the apple to have at least one adjacent empty square, we've met that condition.

Therefore, this path works.

So the moves would be: LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

Which can be represented as L, D, D, R, R, R.

Alternatively, using step-by-step directions, but since each move is a single direction (e.g., each move is one step), that's six steps.

Wait no, each 'move' in the output is a direction to move. So for example, if you want to go LEFT once, then DOWN twice, etc., each as separate moves.

So the sequence would be L → D → D → R → R → R.

But let me count: that's six moves, which brings us to (4,6), and after that, there is an adjacent empty square.

Alternatively, perhaps a shorter path exists.

Wait another approach: instead of moving DOWN twice, maybe move RIGHT earlier.

Let me try:

Move 1: LEFT → (1,8)
Body becomes [ (1,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 2: RIGHT → can't because direction is LEFT. Wait no, after Move 1, direction is LEFT. So next move can't be RIGHT.

So to reach x=4, we need to make multiple RIGHT moves, but in this case, from (1,8), perhaps going DOWN first, then moving RIGHT.

Wait another approach:

Move 1: DOWN → (2,8)
Body becomes [ (2,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]

But initial body after Move 1 would be [(2,8)] + old_body[:-1] = [(2,8), (4,7), (3,7)]

Move 2: DOWN → (2,7)
Body becomes [ (2,7), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 3: RIGHT → (3,7)
But wait, current body after Move 2 is [(2,7), (4,7), (3,7)].

So moving from (2,7) to (3,7): now, the new head would be at (3,7). The old body was [(2,7), (4,7), (3,7)]. So when moving RIGHT to (3,7), which is already in the body as the tail. That's a collision.

Therefore, can't move to (3,7).

Alternative path:

Move 1: DOWN → (2,8)
Body becomes [ (2,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 2: RIGHT → not allowed since direction is DOWN? Wait no, after Move 1, the direction was DOWN. So next move can't be UP.

Wait no, the direction changes with each move. So moving DOWN then RIGHT would change direction to RIGHT.

So:

Move 1: DOWN → (2,8)
Body becomes [ (2,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 2: RIGHT → (3,8). But wait, after Move 1, head is at (2,8). Moving RIGHT takes it to (3,8).

But the current body is [(2,8), (4,7), (3,7)].

So moving to (3,8): new body would be [ (3,8) ] + old_body[:-1] = [ (3,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Check collision: no, since (3,8) is the head and not in the rest of the body.

So now:

Move 2: RIGHT → (3,8)
Body becomes [ (3,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Now, need to get down to y=6.

Move 3: DOWN → (3,7). Wait, but that's part of the body. So can't move there.

Alternative: Move LEFT from (3,8).

But direction after RIGHT is now RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT.

Wait, no. The direction changes with each move. So after moving RIGHT to (3,8), the new direction is RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT.

So need to find another way.

Alternatively, from (2,8) after Move 1, instead of moving RIGHT, perhaps move DOWN again:

Move 2: DOWN → (2,7)
Body becomes [ (2,7), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Now, y=7. Need to get down further.

Move 3: DOWN → (2,6)
Body becomes [ (2,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 4: RIGHT → (3,6)
Body becomes [ (3,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 5: RIGHT → (4,6)
Now, eat apple. Check adjacent squares.

After eating, body grows:

Head: (4,6)
Body: [ (3,6), (2,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Check adjacent to head for empty space. For example, (5,6) is possible if within grid, or (4,5). So yes.

This path seems similar but with more moves.

So initial approach may be better: 6 moves.

Alternatively, perhaps a different route:

Move 1: LEFT → (1,8)
Body becomes [ (1,8), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 2: DOWN → (1,7)
Body becomes [ (1,7), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 3: RIGHT → can't because direction is DOWN? No, after Move 2, direction is DOWN. So next move can't be UP.

Wait, no: each move changes the direction. So after moving DOWN from (1,8) to (1,7), the new direction is DOWN, so next move cannot be UP.

So from (1,7), can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

Move 3: RIGHT → (2,7). Now body becomes [ (2,7), (4,7), (3,7) ]

But (2,7) is now the head, and checking body segments: [ (4,7), (3,7) ] – no collision.

Move 4: DOWN → (2,6)
Body becomes [ (2,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 5: RIGHT → (3,6)
Body becomes [ (3,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 6: RIGHT → (4,6). Eat apple.

Again, same as before. So this also takes six moves.

I think the initial path is correct with six moves: L, D, D, R, R, R.

So the moves are:

1. LEFT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. RIGHT
5. RIGHT
6. RIGHT

Which in terms of directions would be 'LDDR RR' but each as separate steps.

Alternatively, using step-by-step:

Each move is a single direction change, so the sequence is L followed by D, then another D, then R three times.

So the final answer is to output these moves.
</think>

The snake needs to navigate from its starting position (2,8) to eat the apple at (4,6). By moving left twice and down twice, it can reach a position adjacent to the apple. Then, by moving right thrice, it can reach the apple while ensuring there's space to move afterward.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Move LEFT: From (2,8) to (1,8).
2. Move DOWN: From (1,8) to (1,7).
3. Move DOWN again: From (1,7) to (1,6).
4. Move RIGHT three times consecutively:
   - First RIGHT: From (1,6) to (2,6).
   - Second RIGHT: From (2,6) to (3,6).
   - Third RIGHT: From (3,6) to (4,6), where the apple is located.

After eating the apple, there are adjacent empty squares available for movement. Thus, the sequence of moves is LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the head now at (2, 8) to eat the apple at (4, 6).

RULES:
- Text at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 is less important than the text at the end.
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
