  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "It's possible to reach (7,2) by moving right three times and then down six times without reversing direction. Each move avoids collisions with the body segments as they are either added or removed appropriately unless an apple is eaten."
