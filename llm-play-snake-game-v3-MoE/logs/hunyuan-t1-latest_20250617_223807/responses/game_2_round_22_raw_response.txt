========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move DOWN 4 times (from y=4 to y=0) and LEFT 3 times (from x=4 to x=1) to reach the apple at (1,0). Each step avoids collisions with the snake's body, which is mostly along the left edge (x=0) and top (y=9). Moving DOWN first clears the area below the head, then LEFT moves toward the apple. After reaching the apple, there are legal moves (e.g., UP or LEFT) to avoid trapping."
