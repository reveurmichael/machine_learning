Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake's head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (1,7). The grid is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. The current direction is "NONE", so the first move can be any direction, but we can't reverse immediately if we choose a direction. Since the initial direction is NONE, the first move can be any of the four directions, but we need to make sure that the path is safe and leads towards the apple.

First, let's figure out the distance. The apple is at (1,7). The head is at (5,5). So the x-coordinate needs to decrease by 4 (from 5 to 1), and the y-coordinate needs to increase by 2 (from 5 to 7). The Manhattan distance is 4 + 2 = 6. But since the snake's body is empty (the body list is empty), there's no immediate collision risk except walls and the apple's position.

Wait, the body cells are empty. So the snake is just the head. That's a key point. If the snake is only the head, then moving towards the apple without any body segments to block the path. But we need to make sure that when moving, the new head position doesn't collide with any body segments. Since the body is empty, that's not a problem. Also, when the snake moves, the body doesn't shift unless it eats the apple. But since the body is empty, the movement is straightforward.

So the snake can move directly towards the apple. But we need to consider the direction changes. Let's think about the path. The head needs to go from (5,5) to (1,7). Let's see the movement steps.

First, the head is at (5,5). The apple is at (1,7). So, to get there, the snake needs to move left 4 times and up 2 times. However, the order of these moves matters. If we go up first, then left, or left first then up. But we need to make sure that the path is clear and that the snake doesn't hit any walls or itself.

Since the body is empty, the only obstacles are the walls. So, moving left from (5,5) would take the head to (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). Then up to (1,6), (1,7). That's a possible path. Let's check if that's possible.

But wait, when moving left four times, each step is safe. Then moving up twice. That would take the head to the apple. But let's check for any possible collision. Since the body is empty, the only time the snake could collide is if the head moves into a position that's already occupied by the body, but since the body is empty, there's no such position. However, after eating the apple, the body would grow, but since the body is empty now, the first move would be to reach the apple.

Wait, the initial body is empty. So the snake is only the head. When moving, the body list is empty. So each movement step would add the old head to the body list, but since the body is empty, the first move would insert the old head into the body. Let's think about the first move. Suppose the first move is LEFT. New head is (4,5). Then, since the body was empty, inserting the old head (5,5) into the body. But since the snake is only the head, the body list becomes [(5,5)]. Then, since the new head is not the apple, the tail (the last element of the body) is removed. Wait, the body list is empty, so inserting the old head and then removing the tail (which is empty, so the body becomes empty again? Wait, the movement rules say:

In step 3: if the new head is not the apple, then remove the last element of the body. But if the body is empty, then removing the last element would leave it empty. So, the body list remains empty after the first move. So the snake is still just the head. That makes sense. Because when the body is empty, moving normally would not add any body segments. So, the snake is only the head. Therefore, each movement step, the head moves, and the body list is empty. So the snake is just the head, and the body list is empty. So the movement is straightforward.

Wait, but according to the movement update rules:

3. Update body positions (assuming no collision and within bounds):  
a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1).  
b. If new_head == apple position, grow: do not remove the tail this turn (BODY length increases by 1).  
c. Otherwise, move normally: remove the last element of BODY (the tail) so total length remains the same.  

So, if the body list is empty (as in this case), inserting the old head at the front would make the body list have one element (the old head). Then, if the new head is not the apple, we remove the last element (the old head), making the body list empty again. So, for each move, the body list is empty, and the snake is only the head. Therefore, the snake's body is not present, so the only thing to avoid is the walls. So, the path can be straightforward.

So, the plan is to move left four times and up two times. Let's see the order. Let's think of moving left first to reach (1,5), then up twice to (1,7). Let's check each step.

Starting at (5,5):

Move 1: LEFT → (4,5) → valid. Body is empty. After move, body list is empty again.

Move 2: LEFT → (3,5)

Move 3: LEFT → (2,5)

Move 4: LEFT → (1,5)

Now, at (1,5). Then move up to (1,6), then up to (1,7). That would reach the apple. Let's check if that's possible.

Each of these steps is valid. The head is moving left, then up, and each step is within the grid. Since the body is empty, there's no collision. Once the head reaches (1,7), the apple is eaten. Then, the body list would grow. Let's see.

But after eating the apple, the snake's body would have one segment (the old head). So the body list would be [ (5,5) ] (from the first move?), but maybe I need to track that. Wait, when the head reaches the apple, the body list is updated as follows:

At the step when the head is at (1,7), which is the apple's position. So, during that move, the new head is (1,7). Then, the body list is updated by inserting the old head (which was (1,6) before the move). Wait, no. Let me think again.

Let's consider the step when the snake is at (1,6), and the next move is UP to (1,7). The apple is at (1,7). So, the new head is (1,7). The old head was (1,6). Inserting that into the body list. Since the apple is eaten, the body does not remove the tail. So the body list becomes [ (1,6) ] (since the previous body was empty, inserting the old head (1,6) into the front, and since the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed. So the body list becomes [ (1,6) ].

So after eating the apple, the body has one segment. Now, the next move must be safe. The head is at (1,7), and the body is [ (1,6) ]. So, the next move must not collide with the body. For example, if the next move is DOWN, the new head would be (1,6), which is the body's position. That would be a collision. So after eating the apple, the snake must have at least one legal move. So in this case, after reaching the apple, the snake's body is [ (1,6) ]. So the next move can't be DOWN, but can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But since the head is at (1,7), moving LEFT would take it to (0,7), which is valid. Moving RIGHT to (2,7), which is valid. Moving UP to (1,8) is valid. So that's okay. Therefore, the path is safe.

So the moves would be: LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP.

But wait, let's check the initial direction. The current direction is NONE, so the first move can be any direction. But the movement rules say that you can't reverse direction. However, since the initial direction is NONE, there's no prior direction to reverse. So the first move can be LEFT, which is allowed.

So the sequence of moves would be:

["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP"]

That's six moves. Let's check if that's correct.

Each move:

1. LEFT → (4,5)
2. LEFT → (3,5)
3. LEFT → (2,5)
4. LEFT → (1,5)
5. UP → (1,6)
6. UP → (1,7) (apple)

Yes. That's correct. Now, check the final position. The head is at (1,7), which is the apple's position. So the snake has eaten the apple. Now, the body list is [ (1,6) ] (from the previous head position). The next move would need to be safe. For example, moving RIGHT, which is allowed, as the new head would be (2,7), not colliding with the body.

So this path is valid. But is there any other possible path? For example, moving up first. Let's see:

Starting at (5,5):

Move 1: UP → (5,6)

Move 2: UP → (5,7)

Then move LEFT four times. But that would require moving left from (5,7) to (1,7). That's four moves. So the sequence would be UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT. That's also six moves. But that's also valid. However, the problem is that when moving up first, the snake is moving away from the apple's x-coordinate. But that's also a valid path.

But which path is better? Well, both are valid. However, the problem is to find a correct sequence. The question doesn't specify that the path needs to be the shortest, but since both paths have the same number of moves (6), either is acceptable.

But in the initial scenario, the body is empty. So both paths are valid.

But the initial problem is to find the correct moves. However, the user may not have specified any constraints on the path, so either sequence is acceptable. However, the first approach (moving left first then up) is straightforward.

But let's make sure that during the movement, the snake doesn't collide with itself. Since the body is empty, the only thing to avoid is the walls. So both paths are valid.

But the question is about the moves. So the answer can be any of the possible sequences. However, the user may expect the minimal steps, but since the minimal steps are 6, which is the Manhattan distance, both paths are minimal.

But the problem is to find a sequence of moves that leads the snake to the apple without collision. So the answer could be either of the two sequences. However, the user may prefer one over the other. But since the problem doesn't specify any other constraints, both are correct.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the left then up moves. So the answer would be ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP"].

But let's check for any possible errors. For example, when moving left four times, the head is at (1,5), then up twice. That's correct.

Another thing to check is that after eating the apple, the next move is safe. As discussed earlier, yes.

So the answer is the sequence of moves: left four times, then up twice.

Another possible path is to alternate left and up moves, but that's unnecessary. The simplest is to move left four times and up twice.

Therefore, the correct sequence is ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP"].
</think>

To guide the snake from its starting position at (5,5) to the apple at (1,7), we must ensure that each move is valid and does not result in a collision. Given that the body list is initially empty, the only obstacles are the walls of the grid.

---

### 🎯 Objective:
Reach the apple at (1,7) without colliding with any walls or the snake's body (which is initially empty).

---

### 📏 Distance Analysis:
- **X-coordinate change**: 5 → 1 → **4 steps to the left**
- **Y-coordinate change**: 5 → 7 → **2 steps up**

So, the minimal number of moves is **6** (4 left, 2 up).

---

### 🚶‍♂️ Optimal Path:
A direct and safe path is to move **left** four times first, then **up** two times.

1. **(5,5)** → **(4,5)** (LEFT)
2. **(4,5)** → **(3,5)** (LEFT)
3. **(3,5)** → **(2,5)** (LEFT)
4. **(2,5)** → **(1,5)** (LEFT)
5. **(1,5)** → **(1,6)** (UP)
6. **(1,6)** → **(1,7)** (UP) ✅ **Apple reached**

---

### 🧪 Post-Consumption Safety Check:
After reaching the apple at (1,7), the snake’s body will now consist of one segment at (1,6). The next move must not place the head at (1,6), which is now occupied by the body. So, the next move could be:
- **LEFT** → (0,7)
- **RIGHT** → (2,7)
- **UP** → (1,8)

All are valid, ensuring the path is safe beyond the apple consumption.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
```python
["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP"]
```
```

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
