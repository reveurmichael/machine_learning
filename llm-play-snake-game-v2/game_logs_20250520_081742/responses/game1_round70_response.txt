```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake's head is at (9, 0) and the apple is at (8, 0). The shortest path is to move LEFT 5 times to reach (4, 0), but since the apple is at (8, 0), we need to move LEFT once to reach (8, 0). However, the snake's body is vertically aligned at x=9, so moving LEFT is safe as it avoids the body. The correct number of LEFT moves is 1 to reach (8, 0), but the output must have at least 5 moves. Thus, we repeat LEFT 5 times, which will overshoot but is safe and meets the move count requirement."
}
``` 

Wait, this is incorrect. The correct number of LEFT moves to reach (8, 0) from (9, 0) is 1. But the output must have at least 5 moves. So we need to plan a path that includes 5 moves and reaches the apple. Since the snake's body is at x=9, moving LEFT is safe, but we can't overshoot. So the correct approach is to move LEFT once to reach (8, 0), but since we need at least 5 moves, we can add additional moves that don't interfere with the path. For example, after moving LEFT to (8, 0), we can move RIGHT 4 times to return to (8, 0), but this is not useful. Alternatively, we can move LEFT once and then move in other directions that don't interfere with the path. 

But the correct answer is to move LEFT once to reach the apple, but since we need at least 5 moves, we can add additional moves that are safe and don't interfere with the path. For example, after moving LEFT to (8, 0), we can move RIGHT 4 times to return to (8, 0), but this is not useful. 

The correct answer is to move LEFT once to reach the apple, but since the output must have at least 5 moves, we can output a sequence that includes 1 LEFT move and 4 other safe moves. For example, move LEFT, then RIGHT, then LEFT, then RIGHT, then LEFT. This will result in the head being at (8, 0) after 5 moves. 

But the simplest correct answer is to output 5 LEFT moves, which will overshoot but is safe and meets the move count requirement. 

But the correct answer is to output a sequence that reaches the apple in 1 move and then adds 4 safe moves. For example:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "RIGHT", "LEFT", "RIGHT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake's head is at (9, 0) and the apple is at (8, 0). The shortest path is to move LEFT once to reach (8, 0). To meet the move count requirement, we add 4 additional moves (RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT) that do not interfere with the path to the apple."
}
```

This is the correct answer. The snake moves LEFT once to reach the apple, and then adds 4 safe moves that do not interfere with the path. 

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "RIGHT", "LEFT", "RIGHT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake's head is at (9, 0) and the apple is at (8, 0). The shortest path is to move LEFT once to reach (8, 0). To meet the move count requirement, we add 4 additional moves (RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT) that do not interfere with the path to the apple."
