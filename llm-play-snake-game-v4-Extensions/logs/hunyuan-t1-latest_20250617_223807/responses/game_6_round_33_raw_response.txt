========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": [],
"reasoning": "The snake's head is at (7,0) with the apple at (2,0), requiring 5 left moves. However, the direct left path is blocked by the snake's body (cells (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0) are part of the body). Moving left immediately is invalid (reversal not allowed from current direction 'RIGHT'). Other directions (up/right/down) either lead to collisions, grid exit, or no viable path around the body barrier. Thus, no safe path exists."
