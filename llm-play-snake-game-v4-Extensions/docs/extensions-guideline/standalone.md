 Unless for really commmon utils, no need to put things into the ./extensions/common/ folder or similar folders because I want things to be standalone, each and every of the new extensions. But we can regard the ./extensions/common/ folder as a folder for REALLY common utils, that is regarded as standalone as well.

 But we should not be sharing code between extensions. It's forbidden.
