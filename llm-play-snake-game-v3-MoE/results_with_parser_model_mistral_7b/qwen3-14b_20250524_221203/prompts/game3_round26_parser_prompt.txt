<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (0,8), and the apple is at (1,5). The current direction is LEFT, and the body is [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8)]. So the snake is moving left, but the head is at (0,8), which is the leftmost column. Wait, the current direction is LEFT, but the head is already at x=0. If the snake keeps moving left, it would go out of bounds. So the first thing is that the next move can't be LEFT, because that would make the head go to (-1,8), which is outside the grid. So the first move can't be LEFT.

The snake's body is behind the head. The body segments are (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). So the snake is moving left, but the head is at (0,8), and the next body segment is (1,8). So the snake is going left, but the body is to the right of the head. That seems a bit odd. Wait, the body list is ordered from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So the head is at (0,8), then the first body segment is (1,8), then (2,8), then (3,8). That means the snake is moving left, but the body is to the right of the head. That's possible because the snake is moving left, so the body is following. So the body is in positions (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), which are to the right of the head. So when the snake moves left, the next head position would be (0-1, 8) = (-1,8) which is invalid. Therefore, the current direction is LEFT, but the next move can't be LEFT again. So the first move has to be either UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Wait, the movement rules say that you can't reverse direction. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT is invalid (because that would be reversing if current direction is LEFT, but wait, the rule says you can't reverse. For example, if current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN. Similarly, if current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT. So since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So the options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but LEFT would be reversing, which is not allowed). Wait, the current direction is LEFT. So the next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT? Wait no, the movement rules state that you can't reverse. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. But moving LEFT again would be allowed, but the problem is that the head is already at x=0. Moving left would take it out of bounds. Therefore, the first move can't be LEFT. So the options are UP or DOWN.

So the first move must be either UP or DOWN. Let's think about which is better. The apple is at (1,5), which is to the right and down from the head's current position (0,8). So the head is at (0,8), and the apple is at (1,5). The y-coordinate of the apple is 5, which is lower than 8. So moving down would take the head towards the apple's y-coordinate. However, the x-coordinate is 0, and the apple is at x=1, so moving right would help, but the current direction is LEFT, and the next move can't be RIGHT. So the first move has to be UP or DOWN.

Let me think about the body positions. The current body is [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8)]. So the head is at (0,8), then the body is at (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). So if the head moves up to (0,9), that's allowed (since the grid is 10x10, y ranges from 0 to 9, so (0,9) is valid). Then the body would be updated. Let's simulate that.

First move: UP. New head is (0,9). Check for collisions. The new head is (0,9). The existing body segments are (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). So (0,9) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then, the body is updated. Since the apple is not eaten yet (the head is at (0,9), not (1,5)), the body would insert the old head (0,8) at the front of the body list, then remove the tail. The original body list is [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8)]. Inserting (0,8) at the front gives [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8)], then remove the tail (3,8), resulting in [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. So the new body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. The head is now at (0,9). 

Next, the snake is moving in direction UP. The next move would have to not reverse, so can't be DOWN. So the next move options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. But let's think about the path towards the apple.

Alternatively, first move DOWN. New head is (0,7). Check for collision. The existing body is (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). (0,7) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then the body is updated. Insert (0,8) at the front, and remove the tail (3,8). So new body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. Head is (0,7). 

Which direction is better? The apple is at (1,5), which is to the right and down from the head's current position. So moving down might be better in the long run. But maybe moving up first and then down? Let's consider both possibilities.

Let's try moving up first. Head is at (0,9). Then, the next move could be RIGHT, since the direction is UP, and the next move can't be DOWN. So moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,9). Check for collision. The body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. The new head (1,9) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then, the body would be updated. Insert (0,9) at the front, so body becomes [(0,9), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8)], then remove the tail (2,8) because the apple hasn't been eaten yet. So body is [(0,9), (0,8), (1,8)]. Head is (1,9). 

Now the head is at (1,9). The apple is at (1,5). So moving down from here would be a good direction. Next move DOWN: new head (1,8). Check if this is in the body. The body is [(0,9), (0,8), (1,8)]. The new head (1,8) is in the body. Wait, the body's current segments are (0,9), (0,8), (1,8). So the new head (1,8) is the third element in the body. However, the movement rule says that the head can't move into a body cell except the tail's current cell when the tail is about to move. But in this case, the tail is (1,8) (since the body is [(0,9), (0,8), (1,8)]). When the head moves to (1,8), which is the tail's current position. But the tail is about to move. Wait, the movement rule says that if the new head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies. So in this case, the tail is (1,8), and the new head is (1,8). But the tail is about to move. So when the body is updated, the tail is removed. So in this case, the new head (1,8) is the same as the tail's current position. However, since the tail is about to move, the snake is allowed to move into that cell. Wait, the rule says that if the new head is in the body except the tail's current cell when the tail is moving. So if the new head is in the tail's position, that is allowed. Because when the tail moves, it will vacate that cell. So in this case, the head moving into the tail's current position is allowed. So that's safe. 

But after moving, the body is updated. Let's simulate that. The new head is (1,8). The body before moving is [(0,9), (0,8), (1,8)]. Insert the old head (1,9) at the front, so body becomes [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (1,8)]. Since the new head (1,8) is not the apple position, the tail is removed. So the body becomes [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8)]. Now the head is (1,8). 

So now the head is at (1,8). The apple is at (1,5). So the next move can be DOWN again. Let's check. Direction is DOWN. New head (1,7). Check if that's in the body. The body is [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8)]. (1,7) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then the body is updated. Insert (1,8) at the front, so body becomes [(1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8)], then remove the tail (0,8). So body is [(1,8), (1,9), (0,9)]. Head is (1,7). 

Continuing this way, the head can keep moving down towards the apple. However, this path may take a while. Alternatively, maybe a more efficient path.

Alternatively, after the first move of UP, then RIGHT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7), etc. But this seems tedious. Let's think of another approach.

Another approach: since the apple is at (1,5), which is to the right of the head's current position (0,8), but the head is at x=0. The first move can't be RIGHT (since current direction is LEFT), but maybe after moving up or down, then move right.

Let's try the first move as DOWN. So head moves to (0,7). Then, the body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. Next, the direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP. So the next move could be RIGHT, LEFT, or DOWN. Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,7). Check if that's in the body. The body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. (1,7) is not in the body, so that's safe. So head moves to (1,7). Then, the body is updated. Insert (0,7) at the front, so body becomes [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8)], then remove the tail (2,8). So body becomes [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]. Head is (1,7). 

Now the head is at (1,7). The apple is at (1,5). So moving down from here. Next move: DOWN. New head is (1,6). Check collision. Body is [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]. (1,6) is not in the body. Safe. Then body is updated. Insert (1,7) at front. Body becomes [(1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8)], remove tail (1,8). Body is [(1,7), (0,7), (0,8)]. Head is (1,6). Continue moving down. Next move: DOWN to (1,5). Now, the head is at (1,5), which is the apple's position. So that's the destination. 

But wait, let's check if this path is valid. Let's retrace the steps:

1. Move DOWN from (0,8) to (0,7). Body becomes [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)] → after inserting (0,8) and removing tail, becomes [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]? Wait, no. Let's re-simulate the first move.

Original head: (0,8), body [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8)]. Move DOWN to (0,7). Then, the body is updated. Insert the old head (0,8) at the front of the body list, so body becomes [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8)], then remove the tail (3,8). So the new body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. Head is (0,7). 

Next move: RIGHT to (1,7). Body becomes [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8)] → then remove tail (2,8), so body is [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]. Head is (1,7). 

Next move: DOWN to (1,6). Body becomes [(1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8)] → remove tail (1,8), so body is [(1,7), (0,7), (0,8)]. Head is (1,6). 

Next move: DOWN to (1,5). Check for collision. The body is [(1,7), (0,7), (0,8)]. (1,5) is not in the body. So that's safe. Now, the head is at (1,5), which is the apple's position. So that's the end. 

This seems to work. So the moves would be:

1. DOWN (from (0,8) to (0,7))

2. RIGHT (to (1,7))

3. DOWN (to (1,6))

4. DOWN (to (1,5))

But wait, the movement rules also require that the directions are not reversed. Let's check each step for direction changes.

Initial direction is LEFT. First move is DOWN, which is allowed (since it's not reversing). Then, the next move is RIGHT. Since the previous direction was DOWN, moving RIGHT is allowed. Then, the next move is DOWN (from previous direction RIGHT, moving DOWN is allowed). Then, moving DOWN again. So that's all valid.

So this path works. So the sequence of moves is DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN. That's four moves. 

Alternatively, after moving DOWN and RIGHT, could we move directly to the apple? From (1,7), moving down twice to (1,5). Yes, that's what we did. 

So this seems like a valid path. 

But let's check for any collisions along the way. 

First move: (0,7) is not in the body [(1,8), (2,8), (3,8)]? Wait, the body after first move is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. So (0,7) is not in the body. Correct. 

Second move: (1,7). The body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. (1,7) is not in the body. Correct. 

Third move: (1,6). Body is [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]. (1,6) is not in the body. Correct. 

Fourth move: (1,5). Body is [(1,7), (0,7), (0,8)]. (1,5) is not in the body. Correct. 

So that's valid. 

Another possible path: first move UP, then RIGHT, then DOWN, etc. Let's see if that's shorter or not. 

First move: UP to (0,9). Then, move RIGHT to (1,9). Then, move DOWN to (1,8). Then, move DOWN to (1,7), then to (1,6), then to (1,5). That's 6 moves. So the previous path is shorter. 

So the path with first move DOWN is better. 

But let's check for any possible issues. For example, when moving from (0,7) to (1,7), the body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. The new head (1,7) is not in the body. So that's safe. 

Another thing to consider: when the head is at (1,5), the apple is eaten. So the body would be updated. But the problem doesn't require us to consider that, since the question is about the path to reach the apple. 

So the answer would be the sequence of moves: DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN. 

But let's check if there's a shorter path. For example, after moving DOWN to (0,7), then move RIGHT to (1,7), then move RIGHT to (2,7), but that's not helpful. No, the apple is at (1,5), so moving right further would take the head away from the apple. 

Alternatively, after moving DOWN to (0,7), move RIGHT to (1,7), then move DOWN to (1,6), then DOWN to (1,5). That's four moves. 

Yes, that's the same as before. 

Another possibility: after moving DOWN to (0,7), then move DOWN again to (0,6), then RIGHT to (1,6), then DOWN to (1,5). Let's check:

First move: DOWN to (0,7). 

Second move: DOWN to (0,6). The body after first move is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. Now, moving DOWN from (0,7) to (0,6). Check if (0,6) is in the body. The body is [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)]. No, so that's safe. Then the body is updated. Insert (0,7) at front, so body becomes [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8)], then remove tail (2,8). So body is [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]. Head is (0,6). 

Third move: RIGHT to (1,6). Check if (1,6) is in the body [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]. No, so that's safe. Body becomes [(0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8)] → remove tail (1,8). Body is [(0,6), (0,7), (0,8)]. 

Fourth move: DOWN to (1,6). Wait, head is at (1,6), which is the same as the third move's destination. Wait, no, after third move, head is at (1,6). Then, fourth move is DOWN to (1,5). That's two moves. So total moves: 4 moves (DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN). 

But that's also four moves. So same number of moves. 

So either path is valid. 

But the question is to provide the sequence of moves. However, the user might expect the minimal steps or any valid path. 

Alternatively, there might be other paths with the same number of steps. 

But the answer requires the correct sequence of moves. However, the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the path, such as minimal steps, so any valid path is acceptable. 

But since the user is likely expecting the minimal steps, let's check if there's a shorter path. 

The minimal steps from (0,8) to (1,5) is 3 steps: move right once and down 3 times, but the first move can't be right because the initial direction is left, and the first move must not be a reversal. Wait, the initial direction is left, but the first move can be any direction, as long as the movement is valid. Wait, no. The problem is about moving from the initial position to the apple, but it doesn't specify that the direction has to be followed. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. 

Wait, the problem says: "You are given the initial position and the apple's position. You need to find a sequence of moves to reach the apple." 

But the initial position is (0,8), and the apple is at (1,5). The user hasn't mentioned any constraints on the movement, such as not being able to move in certain directions or obstacles. 

Wait, but the original problem might be part of a larger context, like a grid with obstacles, but the user hasn't provided that. The user just provided the initial and final positions. So, assuming it's a simple grid with no obstacles, the minimal number of steps is the Manhattan distance between (0,8) and (1,5), which is |1-0| + |5-8| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps. 

So the path we found with 4 moves is minimal. 

Thus, the answer is a sequence of moves that takes 4 steps, such as DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN. 

But the user might expect the answer in a specific format. Since the user hasn't provided the exact problem statement, but the initial instruction is to provide the sequence of moves, I'll proceed with that. 

However, the initial problem might involve a grid with specific movement rules, like a robot that can only move in certain directions, but since the user hasn't provided that, I'll assume it's a standard grid where you can move in four directions (up, down, left, right). 

Therefore, the sequence of moves: DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN is valid. 

But the problem is that the initial direction is LEFT, but the first move is DOWN, which is not a reversal. There's no constraint on the first move. 

Therefore, the answer is the sequence of moves: DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN.
</think>

To determine a valid sequence of moves from the initial position **(0, 8)** to the target position **(1, 5)** on a standard grid with no obstacles, we first calculate the **Manhattan distance**, which is:

$$
|1 - 0| + |5 - 8| = 1 + 3 = 4
$$

This tells us that the **minimum number of steps required** is **4**, assuming we can move in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) without constraints.

---

### Step-by-Step Path

We choose a path that satisfies the minimal steps and avoids any potential issues with reversals or invalid moves.

1. **Move DOWN** from (0, 8) to (0, 7)
2. **Move RIGHT** from (0, 7) to (1, 7)
3. **Move DOWN** from (1, 7) to (1, 6)
4. **Move DOWN** from (1, 6) to (1, 5)

This path successfully reaches the target position **(1, 5)** in exactly **4 moves**, which is the minimum possible.
