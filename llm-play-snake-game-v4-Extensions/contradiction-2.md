### **5. Configuration Architecture Confusion**

**Problem**:
- `config.md` forbids extensions from using `llm_constants.py`
- But `agentic-llms.md` and `vision-language-model.md` extensively use LLM concepts
- Unclear boundary between "universal" and "extension-specific" constants

**Evidence**:
```python
# config.md says:
# ❌ Task-0 specific - FORBIDDEN in extensions
from config.llm_constants import AVAILABLE_PROVIDERS

# But agentic-llms.md shows extensive LLM integration for extensions
```

**Solution**:
1. **Create clear config hierarchy**:
   - `config/` - Universal constants (game rules, UI, coordinates)
   - `extensions/common/config/` - Extension-shared constants
   - `extensions/{type}/config/` - Type-specific constants
2. **Allow LLM constants in LLM-focused extensions** (agentic, VLM)
3. **Document config boundaries** clearly with examples


I love your solution. modify accordingly across all md files in "./docs/extension/" folder.

This time, you are allowed to modify final-decision-N.md files, if really really necessary.









### **6. Educational Pattern Documentation Gaps**

**Problem**:
- `documentation-as-first-class-citizen.md` emphasizes design pattern documentation
- But many files show code without explaining WHY patterns are used
- Missing educational progression from simple to complex patterns

**Solution**:
1. **Add "Educational Note" sections** to all code examples
2. **Explain pattern motivation** before showing implementation
3. **Create pattern progression guide** showing how patterns build on each other

### **8. Path Management Redundancy**

**Problem**:
- `app.md`, `cwd-and-logs.md`, and multiple other files repeat path management instructions
- Inconsistent imports and setup patterns
- Redundant explanations of same concepts

**Solution**:
1. **Consolidate path management** into single authoritative document
2. **Create standard import template** used across all extensions
3. **Remove redundant sections** from other documents
4. **Cross-reference** instead of duplicating content

### **9. Dashboard Architecture Confusion**

**Problem**:
- `dashboard.md` shows tab-based architecture
- `extensions-v0.03.md` shows different dashboard structure
- Unclear relationship between tabs and functionality

**Solution**:
1. **Standardize dashboard template**:
   ```
   dashboard/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── base_tab.py          # Common tab functionality
   ├── tab_main.py          # Algorithm execution
   ├── tab_evaluation.py    # Performance analysis
   └── tab_visualization.py # Results display
   ```
2. **Define tab responsibilities** clearly
3. **Create reusable tab components** in `extensions/common/`

## 📚 **Documentation Quality Issues**

### **10. Inconsistent Code Style**

**Problem**:
- Mixed coding styles across documents
- Inconsistent type hints and docstring formats
- Some files use different import patterns

**Solution**:
1. **Create coding style guide** with mandatory patterns
2. **Standardize docstring format**:
   ```python
   """
   Brief description.
   
   Design Pattern: Pattern Name
   Purpose: Why this pattern is used
   Educational Note: Learning value
   
   Args:
       param: Description
   Returns:
       Description
   """
   ```
3. **Use consistent import organization** across all examples

### **11. Missing Interconnection Documentation**

**Problem**:
- Files exist in isolation without clear relationships
- No overview document showing how guidelines connect
- Difficult to understand which documents are authoritative

**Solution**:
1. **Create guideline hierarchy document** showing relationships
2. **Add cross-references** between related documents
3. **Establish clear authority chain** (Final Decisions > Guidelines > Examples)
