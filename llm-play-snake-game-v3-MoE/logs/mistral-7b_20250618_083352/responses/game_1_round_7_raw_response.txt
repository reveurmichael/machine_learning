========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

 {
     "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT"],
     "reasoning": "The snake is initially located at (9,5) and the apple is at (9,8). To reach the apple safely without reversing direction on the first move or colliding with walls or body segments, we will proceed in two steps. First, move DOWN to position (9,4), then move RIGHT to reach the apple at (9,8). This path ensures continuous movement and leaves a safe path for future moves."
