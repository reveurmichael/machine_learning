"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (9,0) with direction RIGHT. The only valid first move is UP to (9,1) (RIGHT is out of bounds, LEFT collides with body). Subsequent UP moves (8 total) navigate the head up to (9,8), avoiding body collisions as the body shifts upward. Then, 9 LEFT moves shift the head left from (9,8) to (0,8), reaching the apple. This path avoids self-collision and ensures the snake isn't trapped after eating the apple."
