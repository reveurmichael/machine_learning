Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to think carefully about how the snake can move from its current position to the apple while avoiding any potential collisions with walls or its own body.

### Understanding the Current State

**Snake Head Position:** (5, 5)  
**Apple Position:** (9, 4)  
**Snake Body:** Currently, the snake only has its head at (5, 5), so there's no body to worry about yet.  
**Current Direction:** The head is not facing any specific direction (indicated by "H"), meaning we can choose any initial direction.

**Goal:** Move the snake towards the apple at (9, 4). The apple is located to the bottom-left of the head (since 9 > 5 in row and 4 < 5 in column).

### Planning the Path

To get from (5, 5) to (9, 4), the snake needs to:
1. Move down (increase row) to reach row 9.
2. Move left (decrease column) to reach column 4.

However, since the snake can only move in one direction at a time (and can't reverse), we need to plan a sequence where the snake moves down first, then left, and so on, ensuring it doesn't hit any walls or itself.

Given that the snake is currently at (5, 5) and has no body, the initial moves can be straightforward:
- Move DOWN to increase the row.
- Then move LEFT to decrease the column.

But since the snake can provide multiple moves at once, we can plan a sequence that ensures it reaches the apple without any issues.

### Potential Path

Let's calculate the number of steps needed:
- From row 5 to row 9: 4 steps DOWN.
- From column 5 to column 4: 1 step LEFT.

So, the minimal path is:
1. DOWN
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. LEFT

But since the snake can grow after eating the apple, we might want to plan for future moves where the snake is longer. However, since the snake is currently just the head, we don't have to worry about its body yet.

### Verifying the Path

Let's simulate the moves:

1. **Move 1: DOWN**
   - Head moves from (5, 5) to (6, 5).
   - Snake body: [(6, 5)] (head is at (6, 5), previous head becomes body).

2. **Move 2: DOWN**
   - Head moves from (6, 5) to (7, 5).
   - Snake body: [(7, 5), (6, 5)].

3. **Move 3: DOWN**
   - Head moves from (7, 5) to (8, 5).
   - Snake body: [(8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)].

4. **Move 4: DOWN**
   - Head moves from (8, 5) to (9, 5).
   - Snake body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)].

5. **Move 5: LEFT**
   - Head moves from (9, 5) to (9, 4).
   - Snake body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)].

Now, the head is at (9, 4), which is the apple's position. The snake eats the apple, and its length increases by 1. The new head is at (9, 4), and the previous head becomes the second segment of the body.

### Checking for Collisions

During these moves:
- All moves are within the grid boundaries (rows 0-9, columns 0-9).
- There's no body to collide with initially, so no risk of hitting itself.

### Alternative Paths

Could there be a more optimal path? For example, moving LEFT first and then DOWN? Let's see:

1. **Move 1: LEFT**
   - Head moves from (5, 5) to (5, 4).
   - Snake body: [(5, 4)].

2. **Move 2: DOWN**
   - Head moves from (5, 4) to (6, 4).
   - Snake body: [(6, 4), (5, 4)].

3. **Move 3: DOWN**
   - Head moves from (6, 4) to (7, 4).
   - Snake body: [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)].

4. **Move 4: DOWN**
   - Head moves from (7, 4) to (8, 4).
   - Snake body: [(8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)].

5. **Move 5: DOWN**
   - Head moves from (8, 4) to (9, 4).
   - Snake body: [(9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)].

This also reaches the apple in 5 moves, but it's not necessarily better. The first path is straightforward and doesn't have any disadvantages in this scenario.

### Considering Future Moves

Since the snake will grow after eating the apple, future moves will need to account for the longer body. However, since we're only planning the initial sequence to reach the apple, we don't need to worry about that yet.

### Final Decision

The simplest and most straightforward path is to move DOWN four times and then LEFT once. This ensures the snake reaches the apple without any collisions or unnecessary detours.

### Output

Here's the sequence of moves:

1. DOWN
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. LEFT
