00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,760
Now, the only question I have for you guys now,

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
because I did, in fact, name him Foam.

What do you think Foam should stand for?

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,160
I wanted to see what he was actually capable of,

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,760
so I took him in my living room.

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
I pet him, and then, yeah, I kicked him, okay?

But it was for science.

00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,119
Then I pushed him, but don't worry, he's fine.
然后我推他,但别担心,他没事

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,479
He might even like it, weirdly.
他甚至可能喜欢它,怪怪的。

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,439
He's way tougher than it looks, but he's probably plotting revenge.
他比看起来要坚强得多 但他可能正在策划报复

00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,280
Now I introduced Foam to my actual dog, and that was a mistake.
现在我把泡沫介绍给我的狗, 那是个错误。

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,479
Apparently, my dog thinks Foam is a threat to national security.
显然 我的狗认为福阿姆是对国家安全的威胁

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,799
I think my dog hates him, but honestly, I kind of get it.
我想我的狗恨他,但说实话,我有点懂了

22
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,000
And then Foam tried to assert dominance by jumping at her.
然后Foam试图通过跳跃她来维护主导地位。

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
He can do so many different things, like even climb,

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,759
but I haven't even tried that yet.
但我还没试过

25
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,679
Let me know what else in the comments you want to see me do.
