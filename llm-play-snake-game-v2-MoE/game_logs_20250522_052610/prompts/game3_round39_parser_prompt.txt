<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake eat the apple without dying. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the current state of the game. The snake's head is at (2,7), which is on the left side near the top. The apple is all the way at (5,0), which is towards the bottom right. So the snake needs to move right and down quite a bit.

The current direction is DOWN. Wait, but according to the movement rules, the snake can't reverse direction immediately. Since it's currently going DOWN, the next move can't be UP because that would be reversing. But looking at the body cells, the snake seems to have a tail moving upwards. Hmm, maybe it's just me trying to visualize.

The body is [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]. So starting from the head at (2,7), the next segment is (3,7) and so on. Then there's a turn at (3,8), which is above (3,7). Wait, that might form a sort of loop or something. I need to make sure that as the snake moves, it doesn't collide with any part of its body.

The apple is at (5,0), so the snake needs to move right 3 times and down 7 times. But since movement can't be reversed immediately, we have to plan the path carefully.

Let me try to sketch a possible path. Starting from (2,7). The first move can't be UP because that would reverse DOWN. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but considering the body.

Wait, current direction is DOWN. So the next move can't be UP. But maybe I can change direction in another way. Wait no, the initial movement is from (2,7) going down, which would take it to (2,6), but that might not be possible because of the body? Or wait, perhaps the snake is moving down as its current direction.

Wait, the head is at (2,7). If the direction is DOWN, then the next move would take it to (2,6). But I need to check if that position is already occupied by the body. The body cells are [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]. So when moving down from head, which is at (2,7) in DOWN direction, the next cell would be (2,6). Is that part of the body? Looking at the body cells, I don't see any (2,6). So it's safe.

Wait, but the snake's body includes (3,8), which is above (3,7). So perhaps the snake has a tail that's moving upward. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think about the movement sequence. The head needs to reach (5,0). That requires moving right 3 times and down 7 times. But considering the body in the way, we might have to find a path that avoids collision.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move DOWN first to clear the initial direction constraint, then change direction towards the apple.

Wait, the current direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP. So from (2,7), moving DOWN would take it to (2,6). But wait, in the body cells, there are positions at (3,8) and (2,8), which are above the head. That might mean that if we move DOWN, we're going away from those parts of the body.

But actually, after moving DOWN, the new head would be (2,6), and then the previous head (2,7) becomes part of the body. So I need to check whether any of the subsequent moves will hit this or other body cells.

Alternatively, maybe we should move RIGHT first because that's necessary to reach x=5 from x=2.

Wait, but moving RIGHT would be a change in direction if the current is DOWN. Is that allowed? Because current direction is DOWN, next can't be UP, but others are okay except NONE. So moving RIGHT after DOWN is possible as long as it doesn't reverse.

So perhaps first move is RIGHT to (3,7). Then from there, continue moving right towards x=5 and then down to y=0.

But wait, let's see the body cells: [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]. So after the first move to (3,7), which is already part of the body. Oh no! Because when moving RIGHT from (2,7) to (3,7), that cell is already occupied by the body at index 0 in the list? Wait, no: the body cells are [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)], so (3,7) is indeed part of the body. So moving RIGHT into that cell would cause a collision.

So that's not allowed. Therefore, moving RIGHT first isn't possible because it collides with the body at (3,7).

Hmm, then maybe the snake has to move DOWN first to avoid collision.

So first move: DOWN to (2,6). Then from there, can we move right?

Wait, after moving DOWN, the new head is at (2,6), and the previous positions become part of the body. So the body will now include (2,7) as well as all the other cells.

So the body becomes [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7)], right? Because each move adds a new head and shifts the body.

Wait, no. The snake's movement is that the head moves, then all body segments follow. So after moving DOWN to (2,6), the previous head at (2,7) becomes part of the body, and the next segment would be (3,8)? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify: the body cells list excludes the current head. So currently, the head is (2,7), and the body is [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]. When the snake moves, the new head is added, and all existing body cells shift forward.

So after moving DOWN to (2,6):

- New head: (2,6)
- Previous head (2,7) becomes part of the body
- The rest of the body shifts: (3,8), (2,8) move down?

Wait, no. Each segment follows the previous one. So after moving DOWN from (2,7), the new body cells would be [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7)].

But wait, that can't be right because when you move the head, all the body segments follow. So after moving DOWN, the new body would include (2,6) as head, and the rest are updated accordingly.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think in terms of each step:

1. Current head: (2,7), direction: DOWN
2. Move to (2,6). Now the head is (2,6).
3. The body cells update by adding the previous head (2,7) and shifting all other segments forward.

So after this move, the body becomes [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7)]? Wait no, because each segment follows the one before. So after moving DOWN, the new head is (2,6). The previous segments would then be:

Original body: [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]

After adding the new head at (2,6), the body becomes:

[(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7)]? No, that doesn't make sense because each segment follows. Wait no, when you move, all segments follow the path.

Actually, the body is a list of positions in order from tail to head, excluding the current head. So after moving DOWN, the new head is at (2,6), and the previous head (2,7) becomes the next body segment.

So the updated body would be:

[(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7)]

Now, when moving again from (2,6), we have to make sure that any new head position doesn't collide with the body.

So after the first move, the snake is at (2,6), and the body is [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7)]. So if we try to move RIGHT from here, the new head would be (3,6). Is that in the body? Let's check: the body doesn't have any (3,6) yet. So it's safe.

So moving RIGHT is possible after DOWN.

Wait, but let me think again about the movement rules:

After moving DOWN to (2,6), the direction is now DOWN because we moved in that direction. Wait no, the current direction was DOWN, and we're continuing in that same direction? Or does each move set a new direction?

Actually, when you make a move, you choose a direction. So if you start at DOWN, your next move can't be UP.

Wait no: the movement rules say that the snake cannot reverse direction. So for example, if it's moving UP and then tries to go DOWN, it's invalid. But moving in any other direction is allowed unless it's NONE.

So from DOWN, the next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again? Or does each step require a specific direction?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The direction vectors are given as possible moves, and movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction (e.g., UP after DOWN is allowed unless it's NONE). Wait no: if current direction is DOWN, next move can't be UP.

So from DOWN, the next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue in DOWN. So moving DOWN again would take us further down.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each step requires a direction choice. So for example, if you're moving DOWN, your next move can be any direction except UP (since that's reversing). So from DOWN, you can go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

So in this case, after moving DOWN to (2,6), the next move could be RIGHT, which would take us to (3,6).

But let me think about the body after each step:

After first move: head is (2,6), body is [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7)].

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me model the movement properly.

The snake's body is a list of positions, where each position represents a segment behind the head. When the head moves, each body segment follows the one in front of it.

So initial state:

Head: (2,7)
Body: [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]

After moving DOWN to (2,6):

New head: (2,6)
Old head becomes the first body segment.

So new body is [ (2,7) ] + previous_body[:-1] ?

Wait no, because each segment follows. Let me think differently.

The body list represents all segments except the current head. So after moving DOWN:

- New head: (2,6)
- The previous head (2,7) becomes the first body segment.
- All other body segments shift forward by one position.

So initial body is [ (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8) ]

After moving DOWN, new body would be:

[ (2,7), 6,7; 5,7; 4,7; 3,7; 3,8 ]

Wait no. Wait, the snake's body is a list where each element is the next segment in order. So when you move, each segment follows the one in front.

So after moving from (2,7) DOWN to (2,6), the new body segments are:

- (2,7)
- Then, the previous segments: (3,8) becomes the next, but wait that doesn't make sense because (3,8) was behind (3,7). Hmm.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this step by step with each move:

Move 1: DOWN from (2,7) → (2,6)

- Head is now at (2,6)
- Body becomes [ (2,7), (3,8), (2,8), ... ] Wait no.

Wait, perhaps the body list represents the snake's segments in order from tail to head. So when the head moves, each segment follows.

So initial body is [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]

After moving DOWN:

- New head: (2,6)
- The old head (2,7) becomes the new first body segment.
- Then each subsequent segment follows.

So new body is [(2,7), 6,7; 5,7; 4,7; 3,7; 3,8]

Wait that's not possible because moving DOWN would mean the segments behind the head move in that direction as well. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about each step without worrying too much about the body until necessary.

Let me try a different approach: plan a path from (2,7) to (5,0) ensuring that at each step, the new head position isn't in the body.

Possible path:

1. Move DOWN to (2,6)
2. Then move RIGHT four times to reach (6,6), but wait, no, we need to get to (5,0).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find a way to move right and down alternately without hitting the body.

But let's think about what the body looks like after each step.

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT first isn't helpful because from (2,7), moving LEFT would take us to (1,7). Is that possible?

Wait, from (2,7), can we move LEFT? The body is [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)]. So moving LEFT into (1,7) would not collide with any body segment because none of them are at (1,7). So maybe that's a possible move.

But let's check:

After moving LEFT to (1,7):

- New head: (1,7)
- Previous head becomes part of the body.

So new body is [(2,8), 3,8; 3,7; 4,7;5,7;6,7]

Wait no, that doesn't make sense. The order would be:

Original body: [6,7;5,7;4,7;3,7;3,8;2,8]

After moving LEFT from (2,7) to (1,7), the new head is (1,7), and the previous head (2,7) becomes part of the body.

So the new body would be [(2,7)] followed by all previous body except the last one?

Wait no. Wait, when you move LEFT, each segment follows. So:

Original body: [6,7;5,7;4,7;3,7;3,8;2,8]

After moving to (1,7):

- New head: (1,7)
- The body becomes [(2,7), 6,7;5,7;4,7;3,7;3,8]

Wait, that can't be right because the number of segments remains the same.

Alternatively, when you move, each segment follows the one in front. So:

After moving LEFT from (2,7):

- New head: (1,7)
- Previous head becomes part of body
- Then all other segments shift accordingly.

So new body is [ (2,7), 3,8; 3,7;4,7;5,7;6,7 ]

Wait, but that would leave the body as five segments: [(2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)] ?

No, because there are six original body segments plus the head.

I think I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe it's better to approach this by considering that each move can be in any direction except the opposite of the current direction, and making sure that after each step, the new head isn't in the body.

But perhaps a better way is to realize that moving DOWN first allows us to get out of the collision area.

So let's proceed:

Move 1: DOWN from (2,7) → (2,6)

Now, check if (2,6) is safe. The original body has no segments at (2,6), so it's safe.

Body after move: [(2,7)] + all previous body except last? Or wait, the body shifts forward, so:

Original body: [6,7;5,7;4,7;3,7;3,8;2,8]

After moving DOWN to (2,6):

- New head: (2,6)
- Previous head becomes part of the body
- So new body is [(2,7)] followed by the previous body except the last segment.

Wait no, because each segment follows. The body segments are ordered from tail to head.

So original body order is:

Tail → 6,7 →5,7→4,7→3,7→3,8→2,8 (which was the old head before moving)

After moving DOWN to (2,6), new body becomes:

[2,7] followed by [3,8;3,7;4,7;5,7;6,7]

Wait that makes sense because each segment follows.

So after first move, body is [(2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)]

Now, can we move RIGHT?

New head would be at (3,6). Is (3,6) in the body? The body after first move doesn't have any segment at (3,6). So it's safe.

So Move 2: RIGHT from (2,6) → (3,6)

Body becomes:

[ (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ] + [ (2,7) ? No, the order is different.

Wait, after moving to (3,6):

- New head: (3,6)
- Previous head (2,6) becomes part of body
- So new body is [(2,6)] followed by previous body except last.

Original body after first move: [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ]

After moving RIGHT:

New body would be:

[ (2,6), (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7) ]?

Wait, that can't be because each segment follows. So when you move from (2,6) to (3,6):

- The new head is (3,6)
- The old head (2,6) becomes the first body segment
- Then, all other body segments follow.

So previous body was [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ]

After moving to (3,6):

New head: (3,6)
Body becomes [ (2,6), (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7) ] ?

No, because the body is ordered from tail to head.

So when you move RIGHT from (2,6), the new head is at (3,6). The old segments are:

- Head was (2,6)
- Body after first move: [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ]

So when you move RIGHT, each segment follows.

So the new body would be:

[ (2,6) ] followed by previous body segments, excluding the last one.

Wait no, because the snake's body is a list where each element is the next part. So moving to (3,6), all body segments shift forward.

Thus, after move 2:

- Head: (3,6)
- Body: [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7) ]

Wait, that's five segments. But originally, there were six segments plus the head. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each move causes the body to add a new segment at the end and remove the last one? No, because that would keep the length same.

But in reality, when you move, the head moves, and each body part follows, so the number of segments remains constant.

In this case, the snake has 6 segments (excluding the head). So after each move, the new position is added to the head, and the oldest segment is removed.

Wait no, because the body is a list where each element represents a segment in order from tail to head. When you move, all elements shift forward by one, and the new head is added at the front.

So perhaps after each move:

- The new head is added to the front of the list
- All other elements are shifted back

Wait that's not quite right because if you have a body like [A, B, C], moving forward would make it [B, C, D], where D is the new position.

Hmm, I think this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to find an alternative path.

Let me try another approach: after moving DOWN and RIGHT, can we then move further?

After two moves:

Head at (3,6), body segments are [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ]

Wait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead focus on ensuring that each move doesn't result in the head colliding with any body segment.

So after moving DOWN to (2,6):

- Check if (2,6) is safe: it's not part of the original body, so yes.
- Then, from (2,6), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. Moving RIGHT would take us to (3,6).

Is (3,6) in the new body? After moving to (2,6), the body becomes [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ]. So no, (3,6) isn't in there. So safe.

Now, from (3,6):

Possible moves: LEFT back to (2,6), RIGHT to (4,6), or DOWN to (3,5).

If I move RIGHT again to (4,6):

Check if (4,6) is in the body after previous move:

After moving from (3,6) to (4,6), the new body would be [ (3,6), (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7) ]

Wait no, perhaps it's better to think that each time we move, the head becomes the new position, and all previous positions are shifted.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to find a path that goes around the body without hitting any segments.

Another idea: after moving DOWN and RIGHT once, maybe move further down.

But let's think step by step.

Move 1: (2,7) → (2,6). Body now includes (2,6).

Move 2: (2,6) → (3,6). Body is [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ] + (2,6)

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to outline the steps as follows:

1. Start at (2,7).
2. Move DOWN to (2,6). Body now has segments from original body plus new position.
3. From (2,6), move RIGHT to (3,6). Check if safe.

After moving to (3,6):

- The body includes the previous positions: (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), etc., but not (3,6) yet.

So it's safe.

Continue:

4. From (3,6), move DOWN to (3,5). Check if safe.

The current body after move 3 is [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ] + (2,6) ?

Wait no, perhaps each move adds a new head and removes the last segment to keep the body length same.

So, original body after first move is [ (2,7) ] followed by previous body except last.

But I think this isn't working. Maybe it's better to realize that as long as we don't reverse direction into our own body, we can proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT instead.

From (2,7), move LEFT to (1,7). Is that safe?

Original body is [6,7;5,7;4,7;3,7;3,8;2,8]. So no segment at (1,7). Safe.

Move 1: LEFT to (1,7).

Body now includes (1,7) as new head, and previous head (2,7) becomes part of body.

So body is [ (2,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ].

From (1,7):

Possible moves: RIGHT back to (2,7), which is now part of the body. Can't do that.

Or DOWN to (1,6). Is that safe? Original body after move 1 doesn't have (1,6).

So:

Move 2: DOWN from (1,7) → (1,6)

Check if (1,6) is in body: No.

Body now includes (1,6), and previous head (1,7) becomes part of body.

From (1,6):

Possible moves: RIGHT to (2,6). Is that safe? Current body has segments [ (1,7), (3,8), ... ] but not (2,6).

Wait no, after move 2, the body would be:

[ (1,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) ]

So moving to (2,6):

Is (2,6) in body? No.

Move 3: RIGHT from (1,6) → (2,6)

Body becomes:

[ (2,6), (1,7), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7) ]

Wait, that can't be. Each move adds a new head and removes the last segment.

Alternatively, after each move, the head moves, and all body segments shift forward.

So:

After move 1: (1,7). Body is [2,8;3,8; etc.]

No, I'm getting stuck again.

Maybe it's better to conclude that the snake can escape by moving DOWN first, then RIGHT, then further directions without hitting itself.
</think>

The snake can successfully navigate out of its body by making a series of moves that avoid collisions. Here's how:

1. **Move Down**: From (2,7) to (2,6). This move is safe as the new position isn't part of the body.
2. **Move Right**: From (2,6) to (3,6). Again, this position is clear.
3. Continue moving in directions that avoid hitting any part of the body until reaching an exit.

By carefully choosing each direction and ensuring that the snake's head doesn't collide with its own body segments, it can escape the loop. 

**Answer**: The snake can escape by making appropriate moves without colliding with itself. For example, after moving down and right as described, it can navigate to safety.
