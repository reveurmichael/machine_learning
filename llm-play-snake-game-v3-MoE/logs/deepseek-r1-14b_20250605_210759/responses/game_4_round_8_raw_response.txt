========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (7,2) to the apple at (2,5). Let's see. The current direction is RIGHT, which means the head is moving towards increasing x values. But wait, the apple is at a lower x and higher y than the head, so I need to move left and up.

First, let me look at the body segments. The body is [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. So the snake's tail is at (5,5). Hmm, that's interesting because the apple is also near y=5.

The head is at (7,2). If I move LEFT from RIGHT, which is allowed since it's not reversing. Wait, no, RIGHT and LEFT are opposite directions. Oh wait, according to the movement rules, you can't reverse direction immediately. The current direction is RIGHT, so I can't choose LEFT next; I have to choose UP or DOWN. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, no—current direction is RIGHT. So the next move can be UP, DOWN, or NONE? Wait, no: the movement rules say you can't reverse. So if current direction is RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT. So from RIGHT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continuing RIGHT. Because choosing LEFT would be reversing.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what "reverse" means here. For example, if the snake is moving RIGHT and then tries to go LEFT—does that count as reversing? Yes. So the next move can't be LEFT; it can only be UP, DOWN, or right again.

So first, since the head is at (7,2), I need to decide on a direction. But the apple is at (2,5), which is 5 units left and 3 up from the head. So ideally, we'd move LEFT five times and UP three times, but movement can't be done in one step.

But given that current direction is RIGHT, the first move can't be LEFT because that would reverse. So for the first move, I have to choose between UP or DOWN.

Wait, no—the movement rules say you cannot reverse on the next move. So if current direction is RIGHT, you can't go LEFT next. But you can change direction otherwise—like go UP, DOWN, or continue moving RIGHT.

So let's think: The head is at (7,2). Apple is at (2,5). I need to get left 5 and up 3. So the Manhattan distance is 8 steps. But since each move changes either x or y by 1.

Wait, but movement can't be done in one step; it's per direction change. So let's plan a path that first goes UP a few times to clear space above, then move LEFT, and so on.

But the body is behind, which might block certain paths. Let me see where the body is.

The body after the head is (6,2), which is one step left from the current head. Then (6,3) is up from that, then (5,3), etc., forming a kind of line moving up and left.

Wait, so the snake's body is currently in a way that if I move UP first, maybe I can create space to move LEFT without hitting my own body.

But wait, let me map out the grid. The head is at (7,2). Body segments: (6,2), which is directly left of the head; then (6,3) above that, then (5,3), (4,3), etc., up to (4,5) and (5,5). So from the head's position, moving UP would take it to (7,3), but I have body segments at (6,2) and (6,3). Wait, no—(6,3) is one step to the left of (6,2), which is behind the head. So if the head moves UP, it's going into (7,3)—is that safe?

Because according to movement rules, after moving, I need to check collisions. The new head must not coincide with any BODYi except when it's the tail and it's about to move.

So in this case, moving UP from (7,2) would take the head to (7,3). Let me see if that position is occupied by any body segment. Looking at the body list: [(6,2), (6,3), ...]. The second segment is (6,3), which is directly left of (7,3)—but no, wait, (6,3) is one step to the left and same y as 3. So (7,3) would be above (6,3)? No, because in the grid, higher y is up.

Wait, the grid has (0,0) at bottom-left and (9,9) at top-right. So moving UP increases y by 1. So from (7,2), moving UP goes to (7,3). The body segments are [(6,2), (6,3), ...]. So (6,3) is one step left and same y as (7,3)—wait no, (7,3) has x=7, y=3. The body segment at (6,3) is x=6, y=3. So it's directly to the left of (7,3). So if I move UP to (7,3), that position isn't occupied by any body segments except for maybe the tail?

Wait, no—the tail is at (5,5). So moving to (7,3) would be a safe position because none of the body segments are there. The only body segment near y=3 is (6,2), which is below.

So perhaps moving UP first is possible.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT again? But that's towards increasing x, but the apple is at x=2, which is to the left. So moving right further would take me away from the apple.

Hmm, so I think moving UP first might be better.

Wait, let me also check if moving UP from (7,2) to (7,3) is allowed without collision. Yes, because the body segments don't occupy that position. Also, checking for walls: 0 ≤ x <10 and 0 ≤ y <10—so (7,3) is within bounds.

So first move can be UP.

After moving UP to (7,3), the body updates as follows:

- The old head (7,2) becomes the new BODY1.
- Since we didn't eat an apple yet, the tail will be removed. So the body list would become [(7,2), (6,2), (6,3), ...], but then the last element is removed.

Wait, no—the update step after movement:

After moving to (7,3):

1. Insert old head (7,2) at front of BODY. So the new BODY becomes [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ].

But wait, in the movement example given, when moving LEFT, the body is updated by inserting the old head and then removing the tail. So after moving UP, the BODY would be [ (7,2), followed by the previous BODY list minus the last element.

Wait, no—wait, step 3a: insert old head at front of BODY. Then if not eating apple, remove the last element.

So initial body is [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)].

After moving UP:

- Insert (7,2) at front: new BODY list becomes [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ].

But then step 3c: remove the tail. The current body has length 8 segments plus head. Wait, no—the initial BODY list is from behind head to tail. So after inserting old head, the new body would be [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ]—because in movement example, when moving LEFT, the body was [old head] + previous body except tail.

Wait, no. Let me think again: initial body is [(6,2), (6,3), ... , (5,5)]. After inserting old head, it becomes [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), ... , (5,5) ]. Then, if not eating apple, remove the last element. So the new body is [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ].

So after moving UP to (7,3), the body would now be [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ] and head is at (7,3).

But wait, this might complicate things because the snake's body could block certain paths.

So after moving UP once, I'm at (7,3). Now, can I move LEFT? Let me check. From current direction: previous direction was RIGHT, so if I first moved UP, then next moves can be any except reversing from UP—so moving DOWN would be reversing, but moving LEFT or RIGHT is allowed.

Wait no—the movement rules say you can't reverse the current direction on the next move. So after moving UP, the new direction is UP. Then next move can't be DOWN (reverse). So from UP, I can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

But I need to get left eventually. So maybe after moving UP once, then moving LEFT would be allowed since current direction is now UP.

Wait no—the movement rules state that you cannot reverse the previous direction. So if the snake was previously moving in direction D, next move can't be opposite of D. But after changing direction to a new one, say U, the next move can't be opposite of U.

So for example:

- If I'm moving RIGHT and then move UP, then next move cannot be DOWN (reverse of UP).
- Or if I'm moving UP and then decide to go LEFT, that's reversing UP with DOWN? No, wait—UP and DOWN are opposites. So after moving UP once, the next move can't be DOWN.

But I need to plan a path that allows me to make progress towards (2,5) without getting stuck by my own body.

Alternatively, maybe first move RIGHT again, but that seems counterproductive since apple is left. But let's see: if I move RIGHT from (7,2), which is allowed because current direction is RIGHT. Wait no—current direction is RIGHT; moving further RIGHT isn't a reversal. So can I continue in the same direction.

Wait, yes—I think you can choose to keep moving in the same direction or change to other non-reversed directions.

So from (7,2), if I move RIGHT again to (8,2). Is that a good idea? Because then I'm further away from the apple. Hmm, probably not.

So perhaps it's better to first move UP to (7,3) and then start moving LEFT.

But wait, after moving UP once to (7,3), I can't immediately reverse direction; so if my next move is LEFT, that's allowed because current direction is UP, and LEFT isn't the opposite of UP. Wait no—the opposite of UP is DOWN. So from UP, you can go LEFT or RIGHT without reversing.

Wait, let me clarify: movement rules state you cannot change direction to the exact opposite of the previous direction. So if I was moving in direction D, next move can't be opposite(D).

So for example:

- If current direction is RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT.
- If current direction is UP, next move can't be DOWN.

But moving from UP to LEFT or RIGHT is allowed, as those aren't opposites.

Wait no—LEFT and RIGHT are opposites of each other. So if I'm moving in direction UP, and then decide to go LEFT, that's a change in x direction, but it's not the opposite of UP. The opposite of UP is DOWN.

So perhaps after moving UP once, I can choose any direction except DOWN.

Therefore, from (7,3), I could move LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

But moving UP further would take me towards y=4, 5, etc., which might be useful because the apple is at y=5. But since x needs to decrease by 5, perhaps I need a way to navigate left without hitting my own body.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP multiple times first to get above the current body segments, then move LEFT.

Wait, let me think about the path:

1. Move UP to (7,3).
2. Then move UP again to (7,4).
3. Then move UP again to (7,5).
4. Now I'm at (7,5), which is on the same y as the apple.
5. Now, can I start moving LEFT towards x=6, 5, etc., while avoiding body segments.

But let's check what the body would look like after each move.

First move: UP to (7,3).

Body becomes [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ].

So at y=5, the body is at (4,5) and (5,5). So if I move UP to (7,4):

Body after moving UP again:

- Insert old head (7,3) at front: [ (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), ... , (4,5) ].
- Remove tail, so body becomes [ (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ].

Wait, no—each time we move, the body is updated by inserting the old head and then removing the tail if not eating an apple. So each UP move would add a new segment at front and remove last one.

So after two UP moves:

- Head at (7,4).
- Body: [ (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ].
- Tail is now at (4,4).

Now, moving to (7,5):

Body becomes [ (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ].

Tail is at (4,3). So now the body is a vertical line from (7,2) up to (7,5), then back down?

Wait no, each move adds the old head to the front and removes the tail. So after three UP moves:

- Head at (7,5).
- Body: [ (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ].
- Tail is at (4,3).

Now, from (7,5), I can start moving LEFT towards x=6. Let's try that.

Move LEFT to (6,5). Is that position safe?

Looking at the body segments: [ (7,4), (7,3), ... , (4,3) ]. The segment at (6,3) is in the body, but y=5 for this move. So (6,5) isn't occupied by any body segment because the body only has up to (4,3). So it's safe.

So moving LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5):

- Insert old head (7,5) at front: [ (7,5), (7,4), ... , (4,3) ].
- Remove tail: body becomes [ (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ].

Now head is at (6,5). Next move could be LEFT again to 5, but wait the apple is at x=2. So I need to keep moving left.

But let's check what happens after each LEFT move:

From (6,5):

- Move LEFT to (5,5).
- Check if safe: body segments don't have (5,5) as it was removed when we moved UP earlier.
- Insert old head (6,5), then remove tail. So body becomes [ (6,5), (7,4), ... , (5,3) ].

Wait no—each move adds the previous head to the front and removes the last segment. Let me track more carefully:

After first LEFT move from (7,5):

- Body: [ (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ].

So head is at (6,5). Next, move LEFT to (5,5):

- Insert (6,5) into body: [ (6,5), (7,4), ... , (5,3) ].
- Remove tail: the new body would be [ (6,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3) ].

So now at (5,5). But wait, the apple is at (2,5), so I need to keep moving left. So from (5,5):

- Move LEFT to (4,5).
- Check body: after inserting (5,5) and removing tail (which was 6,3?), so new body is [ (5,5), (7,4), ... , (6,2) ].

Wait, this seems confusing. Maybe I'm making a mistake in tracking the body.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move up as much as possible first to get above all the body segments and then start moving left, so that I don't hit my own body.

But given the initial position, after two UP moves, the snake is at (7,4) with body extending down. Then another UP to (7,5), which is clear. Then move LEFT.

Wait, but each time we move, the body shifts. So maybe it's better to plan a path that goes around the body.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first move RIGHT again. Wait, no—since the apple is left of current position, moving right further would take me away.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach: think about the shortest path from (7,2) to (2,5). The distance is 5 left and 3 up, so total 8 moves. But the problem is that I have a body that's in the way if I don't navigate correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move up first, then right, but no—right would take me away from target.

Wait, maybe another approach: every time I move, my body follows, so I need to make sure that when moving left or up, I'm not stepping into a position already occupied by my body.

But given the initial position:

- Head at (7,2)
- Body segments at (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).

So after moving UP once: head at (7,3). Now, can I move LEFT? From (7,3) to (6,3). But (6,3) is already part of the body. So that's a collision.

Oh no! That means I can't move LEFT from (7,3) because (6,3) is occupied by my own body. So moving UP then LEFT would cause collision.

Hmm, so maybe instead, after moving UP once to (7,3), I need to find another way. Perhaps move UP again?

From (7,3), can I move UP to (7,4)? Then the body at (6,2) is still there, but my head is now higher up.

So:

1. Move UP: (7,3). Body becomes [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ].
   - Wait no—each move adds the previous head to body and removes tail. So initial move UP from (7,2) to (7,3):

   Body becomes [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ].

Wait, I think I'm getting confused about how the body updates. Let me clarify:

Each time the snake moves, it adds a new segment at the front (the previous head position) and removes the last segment if it's not eating food.

So for example:

- Initial state: head at (7,2), body segments from (6,2) to (4,5).

When moving UP to (7,3):

- New head is (7,3).
- The old head (7,2) becomes the first segment of the body.
- Remove the last segment (4,5), so new body is [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ].

Wait no—each move adds the previous head to the front and removes the tail. So when moving from A to B:

- New head is B.
- The body becomes [A] + body_without_last_segment.

So starting at head (7,2):

1. Move UP to (7,3):
   - Head: (7,3)
   - Body: [(7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]

Because we added (7,2) and removed the last segment which was (4,5).

Now, can I move LEFT from (7,3)? To (6,3). But looking at the body, after moving UP, the body includes (6,3). So (6,3) is now part of the body. Therefore, I cannot move LEFT to (6,3) because it's occupied.

So that path is blocked.

What if instead, from (7,3), I move UP again?

2. Move UP to (7,4):
   - Head: (7,4)
   - Body: [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]

Now, can I move LEFT from (7,4) to (6,4)? Let's see:

- The body is [ (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ].
   - So at y=4, x=6: is there a segment? No. Only up to (4,3).

So moving LEFT from (7,4) to (6,4) is safe.

Proceeding:

3. Move LEFT to (6,4):
   - Head: (6,4)
   - Body becomes [ (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ].

Now, at (6,4). Can I move UP? To (6,5).

4. Move UP to (6,5):
   - Head: (6,5)
   - Body: [ (6,4), (7,3), ... , (5,3) ].
   
Check body for collision at (6,5): no segments there.

Now, head is at (6,5). I can continue moving LEFT or UP.

If I move UP again:

5. Move UP to (6,6):
   - Head: (6,6)
   - Body: [ (6,5), (6,4), ... , (5,3) ].
   
This seems unnecessary since the apple is at y=5.

Alternatively, maybe move LEFT from (6,5):

6. Move LEFT to (5,5):
   - Head: (5,5)
   - Body: [ (6,5), (6,4), ... , (5,3) ].
   
Now at (5,5). Can I continue moving LEFT?

7. Move LEFT to (4,5):
   - Check body: after inserting (5,5), the body is [ (5,5), (6,5), ... ].
   - So (4,5) is safe? Let's see.

Wait, initially, the body was up to (4,3). After moving UP earlier, the segments were reduced. Now, after several moves, the body at y=5 would be only new segments.

But I'm not sure—each move adds a segment and removes one from the end.

At this point, perhaps it's better to simulate each step carefully.

But considering time constraints, maybe the shortest path requires 8 moves: 3 UPs and 5 LEFTs. But with the body in the way, some moves are blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP first to avoid collision, then move LEFT as much as possible.

Wait, but moving UP from (7,2) is necessary because moving LEFT immediately would collide with body at (6,3).

So plan:

1. Move UP to (7,3): head at (7,3). Body now includes (7,2), (6,2), etc.
   - Can't move LEFT to (6,3) due to collision.

2. Move UP again to (7,4): body is [ (7,3), (7,2), ... ].
   - Now at (7,4). Can move LEFT to (6,4).

3. Move LEFT to (6,4): head now at (6,4). Body: [ (6,4), (7,3), (7,2), ... ].

Wait no—the body after moving LEFT would be:

After moving from (7,4) to (6,4):

- New head is (6,4).
- The old head (7,4) becomes the first segment.
- Remove last segment of previous body: which was (5,3).

So body is [ (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ].

Wait no—that's not right. Each move adds the previous head to front and removes last segment.

From step 1: after moving UP, body was [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ].

Step 2: move UP to (7,3). Wait no, initial head is at (7,2).

Wait I'm getting confused again. Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps it's better to model each step methodically:

Initial state:
- Head: (7,2)
- Body segments: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]

Each move adds the previous head to body and removes last segment.

1. Move UP from (7,2) to (7,3):
   - Head becomes (7,3)
   - Body: [ (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]
     (removed the last segment which was (4,5))

Can I move LEFT from here? To (6,3). But body includes (6,3), so collision.

So can't move LEFT. What other options?

From (7,3):

2. Move UP again to (7,4):
   - Head: (7,4)
   - Body becomes [ (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]
     (removed last segment which was (4,4))

Now at (7,4). Can I move LEFT to (6,4)?

Check body: does any segment occupy (6,4)? Current body after step 2 is:

[ (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]

So no segment at (6,4). So safe to move.

3. Move LEFT to (6,4):
   - Head: (6,4)
   - Body becomes [ (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ]
     (removed last segment which was (4,3))

Now at (6,4). Can I move UP to (6,5)?

Yes.

4. Move UP to (6,5):
   - Head: (6,5)
   - Body becomes [ (6,4), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3) ]
     (removed last segment which was (5,3))

Now at (6,5). Can I move LEFT to (5,5)?

Yes.

5. Move LEFT to (5,5):
   - Head: (5,5)
   - Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), ... , (6,3) ]
     (removed last segment which was (6,2))

Wait, let me confirm:

After step 4, body is [ (6,4), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3) ].

When moving from (6,5) to (5,5):

- New head: (5,5)
- Add previous head (6,5) to body.
- Remove last segment of previous body which was (6,3).

So new body is [ (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2) ].

Now at (5,5). Can I move LEFT to (4,5)?

Check body: does any segment occupy (4,5)? Current body is [ (6,5), (6,4), etc.]. No. So safe.

6. Move LEFT to (4,5):
   - Head: (4,5)
   - Body becomes [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), ... , (7,2) ]
     (removed last segment which was (6,2))

Now at (4,5). Can I move LEFT to (3,5)? But since the target is (2,5), maybe continue moving LEFT.

Wait, but each move only moves one step. So from (4,5):

7. Move LEFT to (3,5):
   - Head: (3,5)
   - Body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5), ... ]

But wait, the target is (2,5), so need two more LEFT moves.

8. Move LEFT to (2,5):
   - Now at target.
   
Wait, but after step 6:

At step 6: head at (4,5). So moving LEFT twice would take us to (3,5) and then (2,5).

But let's count the steps accurately.

After 6 moves, we are at (4,5). Then:

7. Move LEFT to (3,5)
8. Move LEFT to (2,5)

So total of 8 moves.

Now, check if any collision occurs during these steps.

From step 1 to step 6: no collisions except when trying to move LEFT from (7,3), which we avoided by moving UP twice.

After that, each move was safe because the body didn't occupy the next position.

Thus, it's possible to reach the target in 8 moves without collision.
</think>

The snake can navigate from its starting position (7,2) to the target at (2,5) by following a path that avoids collisions with its own body. The strategy involves moving up first to higher rows where there are no body segments blocking the way and then moving left towards the target.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake's head is at (7,2), and its body extends from (6,2) to (4,5).

2. **Move UP:** From (7,2) move up to (7,3). This updates the body segments to include (7,2) and removes the last segment (4,5). Now, the snake's head is at (7,3), and attempting a left move here would collide with its body at (6,3).

3. **Move UP Again:** From (7,3) move up to (7,4). The body now includes (7,3) and removes the previous last segment (4,4). Now, moving left from (7,4) is possible as there's no body segment at (6,4).

4. **Move LEFT:** From (7,4) move left to (6,4). The head is now at (6,4), and the body segments update accordingly.

5. **Move UP:** From (6,4) move up to (6,5). The body adjusts, and moving further left is now possible without collision.

6. **Move LEFT:** From (6,5) move left to (5,5). Continue checking for safety with each move.

7. **Continue Moving LEFT:** Repeat the left moves until reaching (2,5), ensuring that none of these positions are occupied by the snake's body at the time of movement.

By carefully moving up first and then left, avoiding any collision points created by the snake's own body segments, the target is reached in 8 moves.

**Answer:**

\boxed{8}
