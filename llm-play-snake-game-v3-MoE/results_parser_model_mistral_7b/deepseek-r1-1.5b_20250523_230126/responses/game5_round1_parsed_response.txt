{"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "Start by moving right to (6,5). Then eat an apple at (6,5) and move up to (6,6), which allows us to reach (5,6). Next, we move left to (4,5) and finally down to (4,4). This strategy allows us to reach any position around the starting point using only two moves."}
