"reasoning": "The snake starts at (9,0) with a horizontal body along the bottom row. To reach (4,9), it needs to move up 9 times (increasing y from 0 to 9) and left 5 times (decreasing x from 9 to 4). Moving up first builds a vertical body along x=9, avoiding collisions. After reaching (9,9), moving left 5 times navigates to (4,9) without colliding with the body, which shifts left safely. This path ensures no wall collisions or self-intersections."
