========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

First, let's understand the current state of the snake:
- The head is at (4,0).
- The body cells are [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]. So from the head, moving down along x=4 to y=1, 2, 3. That makes sense because each subsequent cell is directly behind the previous one.
- The apple is at (1,5).

The snake's current direction is "DOWN". Wait, but that might not be necessary for this specific problem since we're given it as input and need to plan a path regardless of how she got there.

Our goal is to move the head from (4,0) to (1,5). To do that safely, I need to ensure each move doesn't cause the snake to collide with itself or hit the walls. Also, after moving, if we eat the apple, we should make sure there's at least one more valid move left.

Let me consider the grid coordinates and possible directions. The head is at (4,0). We need to get to (1,5), which is up 5 units and left 3 units from the starting position. So, in terms of moves:
- Left: each move subtracts 1 from x.
- Up: each move adds 1 to y.

Since we can't reverse direction immediately after a move, but "DOWN" is the current direction, I should check if moving right or up would cause issues. Wait, no—the initial direction is "DOWN", which means next moves can't be "UP". So my first move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But wait, from (4,0), going down to (4,-1) is invalid because y must be >=0. So moving DOWN isn't possible immediately as it would take us out of the grid. Therefore, our first move options are LEFT, RIGHT, or maybe even NONE if we can plan a longer path.

Let's consider each direction:

1. **LEFT**: Moving from (4,0) to (3,0). This is valid because x decreases by 1 and y remains 0, which is within the grid.
2. **RIGHT**: Moving to (5,0), but that might be a longer path towards the apple at (1,5). However, since we need to go left, moving RIGHT isn't optimal here unless it's necessary for avoiding obstacles.
3. **DOWN**: As mentioned, this would take us outside the grid if done immediately because y=0-1=-1 is invalid.

But wait, let me check each direction more carefully:

Moving LEFT: From (4,0) to (3,0). Now, I need to consider where the snake's body will be. The current body starts at (4,1), moving down along x=4. So if we move left, the next position is (3,0), which isn't part of the body yet because the body is at x=4.

So this seems safe. Let me tentatively plan to first move LEFT.

Next step: Move from (3,0) where would I go? If I keep moving LEFT again:

(2,0) → then (1,0). From there, perhaps UP?

But wait, the apple is at (1,5), so going up all the way might be too far. Let me see.

Alternatively, after moving left to (3,0), maybe move UP towards y=5, but I have to check for any body cells in between that could block my path or cause collisions when shifting.

Wait, let's think about how the snake moves each step:

Each time we move:
- The head moves.
- Then, insert the old head into the front of the body list (so behind becomes new head).
- If it's not eating the apple, remove the tail. So the body length remains same.

So after moving LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0), the new head is at (3,0). The previous body was [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)], so inserting (4,0) in front and removing nothing because it's not eating. So now the snake becomes:
[(3,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)].

Wait no, that can't be right. Because when you move, you insert the old head at the front of the body list. The original body is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]. So inserting (4,0) in front gives a new body list: [ (4,0), 4,1, 4,2, 4,3 ], but no—wait:

No, the movement process says:
- After computing new_head, you update the body by:
   a. Insert old head at front of the body.
   b. If not eating apple, remove tail.

So from initial S: [ (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] ?

Wait no—the problem statement says that in inputs, the current snake is [HEAD, BODY1, ..., BODYN], and the provided body list excludes the head. So the full snake includes the head plus the given bodies.

In our case:
Current head is at (4,0), and body cells are [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]. So the full S is [ (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ].

So when moving LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0):

- Compute new_head = (4-1, 0) = (3,0).
- Check collision: Is (3,0) in the body? Current body is at x=4. So it's safe.
- Update body: Insert old head (4,0) at front → new body becomes [ (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] plus any changes.

Wait, but we're inserting the old head into the front of the current body list. So after moving:
- The new body is [new_head] + previous_body = [(3,0)] followed by the rest: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). But since it's not eating apple, we remove the tail.

So removing the last element of the body list. So after inserting, the body becomes [ (4,0) ] + [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ], then remove the last to keep length same? Or wait:

Wait no: according to movement rules:
a. Insert old head at front.
b. If not eating apple, remove tail.

So initial body is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)].
After moving LEFT and computing new_head = (3,0).
We insert (4,0) into the front → [ (4,0), 4,1, 4,2, 4,3 ].

Since it's not eating apple, we remove the tail. So from [(4,0), 4,1, 4,2, 4,3], we have to remove the last element because it was the current tail (4,3). Wait no—the original snake is [4,0] as head and then body cells.

Wait I think maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see:

- The movement step:
   - new_head = move
   - check collision.
   - update body: insert old head into front of the current body list → this makes the new body list include the old head as the first element, followed by all previous body segments in order.

So if before moving, S was [4,0 (head), 4,1, 4,2, 4,3], after inserting old head at front when moving to (3,0):

New S becomes [(3,0) (new head), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)].

Wait no—that can't be right because the body list before was [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]. So after inserting old head (4,0) at front, it becomes [(4,0), 4,1, 4,2, 4,3], but since we aren't eating apple, the tail is removed. The current body list had length 3; when moving, insert one more and remove one to keep same length.

So new body becomes [ (4,0) ] followed by first three elements of previous body except last? Or wait:

Wait initial S was: [ head (4,0), Body1=4,1, Body2=4,2, Body3=4,3 ]

After moving to 3,0:
- Insert old head at front → new_body = [4,0] + [4,1, 4,2, 4,3]
But since it's not eating apple, remove tail (4,3) → so new_body becomes [4,0, 4,1, 4,2]

Therefore, the full S is now:
[ head = 3,0; body1=4,0; body2=4,1; body3=4,2 ]

But wait, this seems a bit strange because the new_head (3,0) is followed by the previous head (4,0), then 4,1 and 4,2. So that would make sense.

But now, what's next? The apple is at (1,5). From here, if I try to move left again:

Head moves from (3,0) → (2,0). Let me see if this causes any collision with the body segments.

Current S after first move: [ (3,0), 4,0, 4,1, 4,2 ].

Wait no—after moving LEFT:
- new_head is at (3,0).
- Insert old head (4,0) into front of current body list.
- Since not eating apple, remove the tail (which was 4,3 before this move? Wait wait.

I think I need to be precise:

Current S is [head (4,0), 4,1, 4,2, 4,3]. So when moving LEFT:
new_head = (3,0).

Check collision: Is (3,0) in the body list [4,1, 4,2, 4,3]? No. So no collision.

Update S:
- Insert old head (4,0) into front of current body → new_body becomes [4,0] + [4,1, 4,2, 4,3].
But since it's not eating apple, remove the last element of the body list to keep length same. So removing (4,3), we have:

[4,0, 4,1, 4,2].

So now S is [ (3,0) as new head, followed by 4,0, 4,1, 4,2 ].

Wait but wait: the initial insertion makes it [4,0,4,1,4,2,4,3], then remove last element to get [4,0,4,1,4,2].

Therefore, current S is:
[ (3,0), (4,0), 4,1, 4,2 ].

So the next move: if we try to go LEFT again:

new_head = (2,0). Check collision with body. The snake's body includes positions 4,0; which is not at (2,0) so it should be safe.

Insert old head (3,0) into front → new_body becomes [ (3,0), 4,0, ... etc.] but wait:

Wait before moving, the current S after first move was:
[head:3,0; body1=4,0; body2=4,1; body3=4,2]

So when moving left again to x=2, y=0.

new_head = (2,0).

Check collision with any of 4,0; 4,1; 4,2? No. So it's safe.

Now update S:
- Insert old head (3,0) at front → new_body becomes [ (3,0), 4,0, 4,1, 4,2 ]
But since we're not eating the apple, remove last element of body list: so from four elements, remove one to keep three.

So after removing tail:
[ (3,0), 4,0, 4,1 ]

Now S is [head=2,0; body1=3,0; body2=4,0; body3=4,1 ].

Continuing this way: move left again to x=1, y=0.

new_head=(1,0). Check collision with current body (3,0) and 4's—so no conflict.

Insert old head into front of current body. Current S before moving is:
[ (2,0), 3,0, 4,0, 4,1 ]

After inserting new_head at front: [ (1,0), 2,0, 3,0, 4,0 ].

But since we're not eating apple, remove last element. So from five elements? Wait no—current S has four segments after the first move:

Wait wait, let me correct this step by step.

After each move:
- Insert old head into front of body list.
- If not eating apple, remove the tail (last element).

So initial S is [head=3,0; body1=4,0; body2=4,1; body3=4,2 ] → length 4.

Then moving to x=2,0:
Insert old head at front: new_body becomes [ (3,0), 4,0, 4,1, 4,2 ]

But then remove last element because it's not eating apple. So the body becomes [3,0;4,0;4,1].

So S is now:

[ (2,0) as new head,
Body1=3,0,
Body2=4,0,
Body3=4,1 ]

Which has four elements again.

Wait no—if we started with a three-element body list and added one before removing, it stays at three.

But in any case, moving to (1,0) is possible since it's not part of the body. So S becomes:

[ (1,0), 2,0;3,0;4,0 ] after inserting new_head, but then remove last element because we're not eating apple. Wait—this might be getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about each move and check if it causes collision with body or walls.

But this process is taking too long. Maybe there's a better way to plan the path without moving left for all four steps.

Wait another approach: since we have to get from (4,0) to (1,5), which is up 5 units and left 3 units. So if I can move in such a way that:

First, go left as much as possible until x=1. Then go up towards y=5.

But need to make sure that moving left doesn't cause the body to block itself.

Alternatively, perhaps after some initial moves, we can start moving Up while also moving Left, which might allow us to turn the corner without colliding with our own body.

Let me try a different approach: instead of going all left first, maybe go up and left alternately. But I need to check whether that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps move LEFT three times until x=1,0, then start moving UP towards y=5 while making sure the path is clear.

But let's think about each step:

Current position: (4,0). Direction is DOWN initially, but after first move we change direction. But according to initial problem statement, current direction is "DOWN". Wait no—the problem says that it's given as input—so perhaps when planning a solution, the initial direction isn't part of what I have to plan.

Wait actually, looking back at the problem statement: "You are given... direction 'DOWN'." So maybe in this specific scenario, our current movement is constrained by the initial direction?

But no—I think that's not correct. The initial direction is just a given; as we plan each move, it should be possible to change directions except when it would cause an immediate reversal.

Wait wait—the problem says: "DOWN" is your current direction—so perhaps you can't reverse immediately after the next move. Wait no—if you're moving in DOWN direction now (from initial position), but if you need to plan a different path, maybe that's not directly relevant because it affects future steps.

This might be getting too confusing.

Alternatively, since we have freedom to choose any valid direction each time except for immediate reversal, perhaps the best approach is:

1. Move LEFT as much as possible without hitting walls or own body.
2. Once x=1, then move UP towards y=5.

Let's attempt that.

So initial head position: (4,0). Body at (4,1), 4,2; 4,3.

Step 1: Move LEFT to (3,0).

Check if safe:
- No collision with body.
- Update S by inserting old head and removing tail.

Proceed.

Now head is at (3,0); body becomes [(4,0),4,1,4,2].

Is this the same as before? Hmm.

Wait let's step through it:

After moving left from (4,0) to (3,0):

- Insert old head into front of current body → new_body = [ (3,0) ] + [(4,1), 4,2, 4,3].
But we need to remove the tail because not eating apple.

So after removal: [ (3,0), 4,1, 4,2 ]

Wait no—the initial insertion would make it length 4 (new head plus original body of length 3). Then since you don't eat the apple, you have to drop one. So from four elements, removing one, we get three.

Thus S is now [head:3,0; body1=4,1; body2=4,2 ]? No—that can’t be right because when inserting old head (4,0) into front of current body list [(4,1), 4,2,4,3], it becomes [4,0,4,1,4,2,4,3]. Then remove last → so [4,0,4,1,4,2 ].

Wait no—current S is:

Original: head (4,0); body [(4,1), 4,2, 4,3].

After moving LEFT to (3,0):

- new_head = (3,0)
- Insert old head into front of current body list → [4,0] + [(4,1), 4,2, 4,3] becomes [4,0,4,1,4,2,4,3]. But since we are not eating the apple, remove last element (4,3) to get a length of 6? Wait no—wait:

Wait initial S is head (4,0); body list has three elements: [4,1;4,2;4,3], making total four segments.

When moving left:
- new_head = (3,0)
- Insert old head into front → now we have five elements? Or am I misunderstanding the way S is structured?

Wait perhaps each move appends a new segment to the body. So initially:

S has 1 (head) + 3 (body segments), total four.

After moving left, new_head = (3,0).

Insert old head (4,0) into front → so now we have [4,0] as the first body part? Or is it that S is a list of body parts including head?

No. Wait initial S: when given, "the snake's body".

Wait no—the problem says:

"You are given... direction 'DOWN'."

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me see the problem statement again more carefully.

Problem statement:

The snake has coordinates (x,y). You have to move it towards a target (apple) position. At each step, you can choose any direction except if that would require moving in the opposite direction of your current facing.

Wait actually—no: "you cannot reverse your movement direction at this moment." So from your current facing, next move must not be directly backward.

So for example, if currently facing DOWN (as per problem), then next moves can't be UP immediately. But perhaps after a few steps, you can choose to go DOWN again.

Wait no—wait the initial direction is DOWN; that means your initial movement is in any of four directions except directly opposite (i.e., can move Left, Right, or Down). Wait no—it says "You cannot move backward." So if facing DOWN, next step cannot be UP. Other directions are allowed: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Wait let me read the problem statement again:

"You cannot move in a direction that would cause you to directly reverse your movement direction."

So perhaps, for example, moving in any of four directions except opposite to current facing.

But if currently facing DOWN, then UP is forbidden. So next step can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Hmm—this complicates the path planning because we have constraints on available directions after each move.

This adds another layer of complexity: when choosing a direction, it cannot be directly opposite the current facing.

Thus, in our case:

Starting at (4,0), facing DOWN. So next step can't be UP.

But as per problem statement: "You are given... direction 'DOWN'." So perhaps that's your initial state—i.e., you have to consider movement options starting from there.

So now, with this constraint, let me try to plan the path:

From (4,0), facing DOWN. So next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But moving Left would take us closer to x=1; but after that, if we need to go Up toward y=5, perhaps after some moves Left and Right alternately.

Wait wait—maybe it's better to use a BFS approach, considering each possible state (position of head, direction) while avoiding collisions with body and walls. However, since this is an initial planning step without programming, maybe I can find a path manually by exploring possible directions, ensuring at each step that moving in the chosen direction doesn't cause collision or wall hit.

Given all constraints:

Current position: (4,0). Body: [ (4,1), 4,2; 4,3 ].

Next move must be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Let's try each possibility and see if it leads towards the target.

Option 1: Move Left to (3,0):

Check collision: No with body.

Update S:

- Insert old head (4,0) into front of current body → new_body = [ (3,0), 4,0; 4,1; 4,2 ].
But wait—after moving, the snake's length remains same because each time you move forward, you lose a tail. Wait no: when you're not eating apple, after moving, you add one head and remove one body part.

Wait more accurately:

Each movement is a step in which:
- You choose direction to move (not opposite current facing).
- Move head into that direction.
- Insert old head at front of the body list (adding another segment).
- If not eating apple, remove tail from body list.

Thus, length remains same as initial; since you add one and possibly remove one when not eating.

In this case, we're moving to a position where S's length would be 4 again after inserting old head but then removing the new tail.

Wait let me clarify with an example:

Current state: head at (4,0), body is [ (4,1), 4,2; 4,3 ] → total four segments.

Move LEFT to (3,0):

- Insert old head (4,0) into front of current body → new_body becomes [4,0] + [4,1; 4,2; 4,3]. So now it's four elements: 4,0; 4,1; 4,2; 4,3.

But since we're not eating apple (assuming first move is LEFT), remove the tail → resulting body becomes [4,0; 4,1; 4,2 ].

Thus S after first move:

head:3,0; body:4,0;4,1;4,2.

Now check for collision with any of these positions—(3,0) is not in the body. So safe to proceed.

Next move options from position (3,0), facing DOWN (current direction):

Available directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Option 1a: Move LEFT again to x=2, y=0.

Check collision with new_body [4,0;4,1;4,2]: head would be at (2,0). No conflict. So:

Insert old head (3,0) into front of current body → new_body becomes [3,0;4,0;4,1;4,2].

Since not eating apple, remove tail: now body is [3,0;4,0;4,1 ].

Thus S is:

head at 2,0; body segments (3,0);4,0;4,1.

Option 1a seems safe.

Proceeding in this way until x=1 can be a strategy. But moving left each time adds to the length of snake's head position but also makes the body follow along—this might cause collision if we don't plan ahead.

Alternatively, perhaps after some initial Left moves, start moving Up while maintaining S's structure.

But I'm worried about running into obstacles with this approach because as x decreases towards 1, y is fixed at 0 for a time.

Let me try an alternative: from (4,0), move Up to reach higher y positions before heading left. But since we're initially facing DOWN, moving UP isn't allowed on the first step. So perhaps we can adjust direction later once possible.

Wait but our initial position is (4,0) and direction is DOWN—so next steps are restricted by that initial facing until we change direction.

But changing direction could take multiple moves, so it's better to plan a path where after each move, the snake's head is in a position from which you can proceed towards target without hitting walls or body.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

Move LEFT three times (to x=1) and then move UP five times (to y=5). But need to see if this causes any collision with the snake's own body during these movements.

So let me map out each step:

Step 0:
- Head:4,0
- Body:[4,1;4,2;4,3]

Step 1: Move LEFT.
New head:3,0
Insert old head (4,0) → new_body is [4,0] + [4,1;4,2;4,3].
Remove last element to keep length same → body becomes [4,0;4,1;4,2 ].

Step 2: Move LEFT.
New head:2,0
Insert old head (3,0) into front of current body → new_body is [3,0;4,0;4,1;4,2].
Remove last element after not eating apple → body becomes [3,0;4,0;4,1 ].

Step 3: Move LEFT.
New head:1,0
Insert old head (2,0) into front of current body → new_body is [2,0;3,0;4,0;4,1].
Since we're not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [2,0;3,0;4,0 ].

Now at position 1,0. Body segments:2,0;3,0;4,0.

Next steps:

Step 4: Move UP.
New head:1,1
Insert old head (1,0) into front of current body → new_body is [1,0;2,0;3,0;4,0].
Since we're not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [1,0;2,0;3,0 ].

Step 5: Move UP.
New head:1,2
Insert old head (1,1) into front of current body → new_body is [1,1;1,0;2,0;3,0].
Remove last element → body becomes [1,1;1,0;2,0 ].

Wait no—current state after step 4: moving to (1,1), inserting old head as first segment. So new_body is:

[ (1,0) inserted as the new head at front? Wait perhaps I'm getting confused with how S's body is structured.

Alternatively, maybe each move adds a new segment in the direction moved, so for example:

After step 3: head at 1,0; body segments [2,0;3,0;4,0].

Moving UP to (1,1):

Insert old head into front → S's head is inserted as first part, then previous head is next.

Wait perhaps I'm not modeling this correctly. Let me think of the snake's body as a linked list: each move adds a new node at the front, and if it's not the end (i.e., eating apple), the last node is removed.

So in step 3, after moving to 1,0:

S has head at 1,0; then body parts [2,0;3,0;4,0].

Step 4: Move UP to 1,1.

Insert old head (1,0) into front of current body → new_body = [1,0;2,0;3,0;4,0 ].
But since we are not eating apple, remove last element → now body is [1,0;2,0;3,0 ].

So S's head after step 4: (1,1); body segments (1,0;2,0;3,0).

Now moving UP again to 1,2:

Insert old head (1,1) → new_body = [1,1;1,0;2,0;3,0 ].
Remove last element (3,0) as not eating apple. New body is [1,1;1,0;2,0].

Proceeding in this way:

Step 5: Move UP to 1,3.

Insert old head → new_body = [1,3;1,1;1,0;2,0 ].
Wait no—current state after step4 is:

Head at (1,1); body segments are [1,0;2,0;3,0].

Moving UP to 1,2: insert old head (1,1) → new_body becomes [1,1] followed by the current body minus last element.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Each step appends a segment in front and then removes one at end if necessary, keeping total length same as initial (4).

So:

After moving UP to 1,2: head is (1,2); body is [ (1,1);1,0;2,0 ].

Wait not sure—perhaps each move adds a new segment in the direction moved. So for example, when you move Left from (x,y), your next body part becomes x-1,y.

Similarly, moving Up would make y+1.

Thus, S's body is always ordered such that each new head is added to front of previous head position.

So:

At step 3: head at (1,0); body segments [2,0;3,0;4,0 ].

Step4: Move UP. New head at (1,1). Insert old head into front → S's body becomes [(1,0), 2,0,3,0,4,0 ]. Then remove last element (since not eating apple) → new_body is [ (1,0);2,0;3,0 ].

Wait no—because the length must stay same as initial. So when moving to a new position and inserting old head into front, you get n+1 segments but then if not eating, remove one at end.

Thus:

Each move results in S's body having (n + 1) - 1 = n elements again.

So for step4: after moving UP from (1,0) to (1,1):

- Insert old head into front → [ (1,0),2,0;3,0;4,0 ] → now four segments.
Since not eating apple, remove last element → new_body is [(1,0);2,0;3,0].

But the new head is at 1,1. So body parts are:

First part: old head (previously was (1,0)), then followed by previous body except last.

Wait maybe this approach isn't working because each step adds a segment in front and removes one at end. Thus after moving UP to y=5, let's see if the snake doesn't collide with itself or walls.

Alternatively, perhaps another strategy is required—maybe instead of moving left all the way first, we can mix directions to navigate around obstacles (if any). But as per problem statement, I don't think there are any. So collision only happens when a part of the body overlaps new head position.

So let's try following steps:

Step0: (4,0), facing DOWN.
Step1: Move LEFT →3,0; no collision with body [4,0 is next to 3,0? Wait snake's initial body after step1 would be [4,0;4,1;4,2 ].

Wait head at 3,0. Is any part of the body at (3,0)? No. So safe.

Step2: Move LEFT →2,0; body becomes [3,0;4,0;4,1].

Proceeding further:

Step3: Move LEFT→1,0; body is [2,0;3,0;4,0 ].

Now at (1,0); can't move left anymore. Now need to move Up towards y=5.

But moving up step by step without collision.

Let me proceed:

After reaching 1,0, in steps 4-9:

Step4: Move UP →1,1; body is [2,0;3,0;4,0 ].

Wait no—insert old head (1,0) into front. Then since not eating apple, remove last element of current body.

Current state before step4: head at 1,0; body segments [2,0;3,0;4,0 ].

After moving UP to (1,1):

Insert (1,0); new_body is [(1,0),2,0;3,0;4,0 ] → then remove last element → new_body becomes [ (1,0),2,0;3,0 ].

So body segments are 1,0;2,0;3,0. Next step:

Step5: Move UP to (1,2). Insert old head (1,1) into front and remove last element → body is [(1,1);1,0;2,0 ].

Step6: Move UP to (1,3). Insert old head (1,2) → new_body [1,2;1,1;1,0;2,0 ]. Remove last → [1,2;1,1;1,0 ].

But wait no—if we are moving step by step:

After Step5: body is [(1,1);1,0;2,0 ].

Step6: Move UP to (1,3). Insert old head (1,2) into front → new_body [1,2; 1,1; 1,0; 2,0 ]. Since not eating apple, remove last element → body is [1,2; 1,1; 1,0 ].

No collision at (1,3).

Proceeding:

Step7: Move UP to (1,4). Insert old head into front. Body becomes [(1,3);1,2;1,1;1,0 ]. Remove last → [1,3;1,2;1,1 ].

Check for collision at 1,4—no issues.

Step8: Move UP to (1,5). But wait target is (1,5), so moving up again would be:

Insert old head (1,4) into front. new_body becomes [(1,4);1,3;1,2;1,1 ] → remove last element if not eating.

But since we are not at apple position yet? Or perhaps target is 1,5—so moving UP will take us closer to there.

Wait no—if our target is (1,5), then stepping from y=4 to y=5. But according to problem statement, the snake's initial direction is DOWN; so when we've reached x=1,y=0, and now facing to move Up—so in steps 4-8: moving UP five times would get us to (1,5). But let me check:

Wait current position after step3: (1,0).

Step4: (1,1)

Step5: (1,2)

Step6: (1,3)

Step7: (1,4)

Step8: (1,5) → target reached.

So if we can move Up five times without colliding with body parts:

But let's check each step for collision after moving Up.

After Step3: head at 1,0; body is [2,0;3,0;4,0 ].

Step4: Move UP to (1,1). Insert old head as new front. Then remove last element of current body → so body becomes [1,0;2,0;3,0 ].

Is any part of the body at (1,1)? No—previous body parts are 2,0 etc.

Proceeding:

Step4: Body is now [1,0;2,0;3,0].

Step5: Move UP to (1,2). Insert old head as front. new_body = [ (1,1);1,0;2,0;3,0 ] → remove last element since not eating apple → body becomes [1,1;1,0;2,0 ].

No collision at 1,2.

Step6: Move UP to (1,3). Insert old head as front. new_body = [(1,2);1,1;1,0;2,0 ] → remove last element → body becomes [1,2;1,1;1,0 ].

No collision at 1,3.

Step7: Move UP to (1,4). Insert old head as front. new_body = [(1,3);1,2;1,1;1,0 ] → remove last element → body becomes [1,3;1,2;1,1 ].

No collision at 1,4.

Step8: Move UP to (1,5). Insert old head as front. new_body = [(1,4);1,3;1,2;1,1 ] → remove last element since not eating → body becomes [1,4;1,3;1,2 ].

No collision at 1,5—done!

Thus the path is:

From (4,0), move LEFT thrice to reach x=1,y=0. Then move Up five times to y=5.

But wait in step8: after moving UP from (1,4)→(1,5). So now snake's head is at (1,5)—target achieved.

Thus the sequence of moves is:

1. Move Left
2. Move Left
3. Move Left
4. Move Up
5. Move Up
6. Move Up
7. Move Up
8. Move Up

So to write the final answer, it's a path that involves moving left three times and then up five times.

But perhaps we can find a shorter way or avoid some steps—maybe we can move in other directions as well but given there are no obstacles, moving straight left first is straightforward.
</think>

The snake starts at (4,0) facing down. To reach the target position (1,5), it moves left three times to decrease its x-coordinate from 4 to 1, and then moves up five times to increase its y-coordinate from 0 to 5.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Move LEFT: Position becomes (3,0).
2. Move LEFT again: Position becomes (2,0).
3. Move LEFT once more: Position becomes (1,0).
4. Now move UP: From (1,0) to (1,1), then continue moving Up four more times to reach (1,5).

Thus, the snake follows a path of three left moves followed by five up moves.

Final Answer:
The snake should first move left three times and then move up five times. The sequence is: LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.
