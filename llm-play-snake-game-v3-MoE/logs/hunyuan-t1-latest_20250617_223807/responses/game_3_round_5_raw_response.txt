========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,6) with direction LEFT. To reach the apple at (1,7), the first move should be UP to (0,7), avoiding collisions. The second move RIGHT reaches (1,7) (the apple). This path avoids self-collision and ensures a legal next move (e.g., UP or RIGHT) after eating the apple."
