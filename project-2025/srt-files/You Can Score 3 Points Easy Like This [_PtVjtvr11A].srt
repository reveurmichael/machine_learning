why are you trying to make sure you land

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:01,920
why are you trying to make sure you land
 

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,389
why are you trying to make sure you land
behind the three-point line when you

4
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:03,399
behind the three-point line when you
 

5
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,869
behind the three-point line when you
shoot because it only counts as three

6
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:05,879
shoot because it only counts as three
 

7
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,350
shoot because it only counts as three
points if you land behind the line duh

8
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:08,360
points if you land behind the line duh
 

9
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,549
points if you land behind the line duh
no you can actually land in front of the

10
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
no you can actually land in front of the
 

11
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,190
no you can actually land in front of the
line and it still counts as three points

12
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
line and it still counts as three points
 

13
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,150
line and it still counts as three points
how because it's not where you land it's

14
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
how because it's not where you land it's
 

15
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,349
how because it's not where you land it's
where you start the shot from so you're

16
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:18,359
where you start the shot from so you're
 

17
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,390
where you start the shot from so you're
telling me I could do floaters and

18
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
telling me I could do floaters and
 

19
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,310
telling me I could do floaters and
layups from the three-point line and it

20
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
layups from the three-point line and it
 

21
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,880
layups from the three-point line and it
still counts as three points yes
