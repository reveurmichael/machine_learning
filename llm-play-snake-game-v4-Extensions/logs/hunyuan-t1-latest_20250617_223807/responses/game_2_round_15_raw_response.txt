{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (3,3) with direction UP. Moving UP repeatedly aligns the head with the apple's y-coordinate (9) while avoiding body collisions. After reaching (3,9), moving RIGHT to (4,9) reaches the apple. This path ensures no self-collisions, stays in bounds, and leaves safe moves post-apple consumption."
