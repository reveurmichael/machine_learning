{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 2 times and down 3 times to reach the apple at (5,2). Starting with the current direction 'RIGHT', moving right twice avoids body collisions and stays in bounds. Then moving down three times navigates toward the apple, checking each new head position against the body (which shifts safely each step). After reaching the apple, there are legal moves (e.g., down or left) to avoid trapping."
