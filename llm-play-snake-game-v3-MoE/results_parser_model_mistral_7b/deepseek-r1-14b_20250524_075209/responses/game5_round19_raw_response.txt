========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (1,7) and needs to reach the apple at (2,9). The current direction is "UP", so I can't move DOWN immediately.

First, I'll visualize the grid. The head is at (1,7), which is one cell below (1,8) and two cells below the apple at (2,9). The body segments are [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)], so the snake is currently moving upwards along x=1.

Since the direction is "UP", my first move can't be "DOWN". So from "UP", I can choose "LEFT", "RIGHT", or stay in "UP".

Looking at the apple's position (2,9), which is to the right and two cells up from the head. The Manhattan distance is 1 (right) + 2 (up) = 3.

I need to find a path that avoids collisions with the body. The body is behind the head along x=1, so moving right first might be safer.

If I move RIGHT, the new head will be at (2,7). Then, I can continue moving UP twice to reach (2,9), avoiding any collision since the body is moving upwards and away from the path.

I'll check each step for collisions:
- Moving RIGHT: New head is (2,7). The body is still along x=1, so no collision.
- Next move UP: Head becomes (2,8). Still safe.
- Final move UP: Reaches (2,9), which is the apple's position.

This path ensures I don't reverse direction and avoids any self-collision. Plus, after eating the apple, the body grows, but since there are still legal moves left, it won't trap me immediately.

{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move right to (2,7), then up twice to reach the apple at (2,9) safely without reversing direction and avoiding body collisions."
}
