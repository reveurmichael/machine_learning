========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how the snake can get from (1,7) to (4,2). So, the head is at (1,7), and the apple is at (4,2). The current direction is LEFT, but I remember that we can't reverse direction immediately. Since the direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

Looking at the body cells: [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]. So, the snake's body extends from (1,7) to (2,7), then down to (2,6), and so on. The tail is at (2,5). 

First, let's check where we can move without causing immediate collision. Since the current direction is LEFT, and next moves can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

But wait, moving LEFT from (1,7) would take us to (0,7), but I need to make sure that's not occupied by the body. The body cells after the head are at higher x-values, so (0,7) is safe as long as it doesn't hit any walls or body parts except maybe when considering future moves.

Wait, no, because moving LEFT from (1,7) would take us to (0,7), which isn't part of the body. But we have to consider if this move would cause a collision in the next steps. Also, after moving, the body will shift. 

Let me think about possible directions:

Option 1: Move DOWN first. From (1,7) moving down takes us to (1,6). Is that safe? The body cells are at (2,7), (2,6), and (2,5). So, after the move, the new head would be at (1,6). Then we need to check if any of the body parts except the tail will block us.

Wait, but moving DOWN from (1,7) would make the head (1,6), which is right above (1,5), which isn't part of the body. So that seems okay.

But wait, after moving DOWN, the body shifts. Let me think about how the movement works. The new head is inserted at the front of the body list, and then if not growing, the tail is removed. 

So, if we move DOWN once, let's see what happens:

- New head: (1,6)
- Body becomes [(1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]
- But since we didn't eat an apple, the tail moves from (2,5) to (2,6)? Wait no, wait. When moving normally, after inserting the old head at the front of the body list, the tail is removed.

Wait, let me clarify the movement steps:

When a normal move happens (not eating apple), the new head is added to the front of the body list, and then the tail is removed. So the length remains the same unless we ate an apple.

So in our initial state, after moving DOWN once:

- New head: (1,6)
- Body becomes [(1,7), (2,7), (2,6)] but since it's a normal move, the tail (2,5) is removed. Wait no, wait: The body list given is [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]. After moving DOWN, the new head is at (1,6). So the body becomes [old_head (1,7)] + existing_body.

Wait, let's recheck:

The initial S is [HEAD (1,7), BODY1 (2,7), BODY2 (2,6), BODY3 (2,5)]. 

When moving in a direction, step 3a says insert the old head into the front of the body list. So after moving DOWN, new_head is (1,6). Then, step 3b: if not eating apple, remove tail.

So the new S would be:

HEAD = (1,6)

BODY becomes [old_head (1,7), (2,7), (2,6)], because we removed the last element (2,5).

Wait no, because after inserting old head at front of body list, which was [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5)], so new body list becomes [(1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]. Then, since we didn't eat apple, we remove the tail: so BODY is now [(1,7), (2,7), (2,6)].

So after first move DOWN:

S = [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]

Is this causing any collision? The new head (1,6) should not be in the body except possibly if it's the old tail. But since we didn't eat apple, and the tail was removed, I think it's safe.

Wait no, when inserting the old head into the front of the body list, which becomes BODY1 to BODYn+1, then removing the last element, which is the original tail (2,5). So the new body after move DOWN would be [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

So, checking for collision: The new head is at (1,6). Does this position coincide with any of the body cells except possibly the tail? Well, in this case, the old_head (1,7) was inserted as BODY1, and the rest are (2,7), (2,6). So (1,6) is not among them. Thus, no collision.

So moving DOWN first seems safe.

But wait, our goal is to get to (4,2). Let me consider the path from there.

From (1,7), we need to move right three times and down five times. But considering that movement in LEFT direction is restricted initially because current direction is LEFT.

Wait, no: The initial direction is LEFT, but according to movement rules, you can't reverse direction immediately. So since current direction is LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT.

So possible first moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.

But moving LEFT from (1,7) would take us to (0,7), which is on the edge. Let me see if that's a good idea.

After moving LEFT:

- New head: (0,7)
- Body becomes [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ] then remove tail (2,5), so body is [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]

So S after move is [ (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]

Wait no, initial body was [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]. After inserting old head (1,7) at front, the body becomes [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ], and then since not eating apple, remove tail: [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

So new S is [ (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]? Wait no, the body list after inserting old head becomes length 4, but then we remove tail, making it back to 3. So:

Wait, initial body has 3 elements: [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5)].

After moving LEFT, new_head is (0,7). Then step 3a: insert old head (1,7) at front of body list → [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ].

Then step 3c: since not eating apple, remove last element (2,5), so body becomes [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

So S after move is [ (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]? Wait no. The head is now (0,7), and the body is [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

Wait, no: when you move LEFT, new_head is (0,7). Then step 3a: insert old head (which was (1,7)) into front of body list. So body becomes [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ].

But then step 3c: remove tail if not eating apple → so new body is [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

So the full snake after move would be [ (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]. Wait no. The head is (0,7). Then the body list is [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to outline it step by step:

Original state:
- Head: (1,7)
- Body: [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]
Direction is LEFT.

Move direction: LEFT → new_head = (0,7).

Check collision: (0,7) not in body except possible tail when it moves. But the body after step 3a will be [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) ], and then we remove the tail → so body becomes [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

So the new head is at (0,7). The body cells are now (1,7), (2,7), (2,6).

So collision check: does (0,7) appear in any of these except when it's part of the moving tail? Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail becomes (2,6). So the new head is at (0,7), which isn't present elsewhere.

Thus, safe to move LEFT first.

But from there, our position is (0,7), and we need to reach (4,2). That's a long way, but perhaps moving right eventually.

However, since we can't immediately reverse direction from LEFT to RIGHT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So if I move LEFT again, taking us to (-1,7), which is off the grid? Wait, no: in this problem, does the grid have walls? The initial problem didn't specify, but likely the snake can't go beyond the grid. So moving to x=0 when current direction is LEFT would take us to (0-1,7) = (-1,7), which is invalid.

So perhaps moving LEFT again isn't allowed because it's off the grid. Therefore, after moving LEFT once to (0,7), our next move can be UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT yet.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe moving DOWN first is better.

So let's consider moving DOWN as the first step.

From (1,7) → (1,6). Then body becomes [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

Now, from (1,6), next move can be RIGHT because current direction was LEFT, but after moving DOWN, the new direction is DOWN. So we can choose any direction except the reverse of DOWN, which would be UP?

Wait no: movement rules don't restrict based on prior direction except for reversing. Wait, according to the problem statement, when changing direction, you can't move in the opposite direction of your current movement.

So if current direction is LEFT, next moves can't be RIGHT, unless you change direction by moving up or down first.

Wait no: I think the rule is that you cannot make a 180-degree turn; i.e., you can't go back the way you came. So for example, if you're moving LEFT, your next move can't be RIGHT.

But once you change direction with a UP or DOWN move, then you can go any direction except reversing from that new direction.

Wait, I'm not sure about this. Let me recheck the movement rules: "You cannot reverse direction in consecutive moves." So if you're moving LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT; but after making another move (like UP or DOWN), the next move can be any direction except the reverse of that new direction.

Wait no, perhaps more accurately, each time you change direction, you can't go back to the previous direction until you make at least one move in a different direction. Or maybe it's simpler: you can't reverse direction immediately; you have to make a turn (like 90 degrees) before making another reversal.

Wait no, according to the problem description, "You cannot make a move that reverses your current direction." So if you're moving LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. Similarly, if moving UP, next move can't be DOWN; and vice versa.

So after each move, as long as the next move isn't the opposite direction of the previous one, it's allowed.

Wait no: perhaps the rule is that consecutive moves can't reverse direction. So for example:

If you're currently moving LEFT, your next move cannot be RIGHT.

But if you change direction with a UP or DOWN move, then the next move can be any except reversing from that new direction.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps I should focus on the initial step: what's the best first move without causing collision and allowing us to reach (4,2).

Option 1: Move DOWN to (1,6). Then from there, we can move RIGHT or other directions.

Wait, but moving RIGHT after that would be allowed because previous direction was DOWN, not LEFT. So perhaps this is a good path.

Alternatively, Option 2: Move LEFT first to (0,7), then find another way.

But let's evaluate both options.

Option 1:

Move DOWN → (1,6).

Now, the head is at (1,6). Next moves can be any except UP (since previous move was DOWN; no, wait, according to rules, consecutive moves cannot reverse direction. So moving from DOWN to UP would be reversing, but moving from DOWN to LEFT or RIGHT or anything else is allowed.

So after DOWN, next move can't be UP.

So from (1,6), possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

Moving LEFT again from here could take us further left, but that might not help in reaching the goal. Maybe moving RIGHT towards x=4 would be better.

But wait, from (1,6), moving RIGHT takes us to (2,6). Let's see:

After first move: HEAD=(1,6), BODY=[ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

Then, moving RIGHT to (2,6):

New_head = (2,6)

Check collision: Is (2,6) in the body list? The new head is at (2,6). After inserting old head (1,6) into the front of the body:

BODY becomes [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]

Then, since not eating apple, remove tail → BODY=[ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ].

Wait no: initial body after first move was [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]. Then moving RIGHT to (2,6):

- Insert old head (1,6) at front → [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]

Then remove tail (2,6) → so body becomes [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ].

So new S is [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ].

Wait, but the head is at (2,6). Does this collide with any other body part? The new_head (2,6) is now in the body as the last element after inserting old_head. But we remove tail, so it's no longer there. Wait:

After moving RIGHT to (2,6):

- New head: (2,6)
- Insert old_head (1,6) into front of body list → [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]
- Remove tail (2,6) because not eating apple → body becomes [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ]

So the full snake is now:

Head: (2,6)

Body: [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ]

Wait no: The new head is at (2,6). The body is inserted as follows:

After moving RIGHT, step 3a inserts old_head (which was (1,6)) into front of the existing body list. So the existing body after first move was [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ].

Wait no: Wait, initial state after first move DOWN was:

Head: (1,6)

Body: [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]

Then moving RIGHT to (2,6):

- New head: (2,6)
- Insert old_head (1,6) into front of body list → new_body = [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ]
- Remove tail because not eating apple → body becomes [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ]

So the full snake is:

[ (2,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ]

Wait no: The head is at (2,6). Then the body list is [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ].

So checking for collision, does the new head (2,6) appear in any part of the body except the tail that's about to move? No. Because after inserting old_head and then removing tail, the body doesn't include (2,6) anymore.

Thus, moving RIGHT from (1,6) is safe.

Now, we're at (2,6). Next, we can move in any direction except UP, because previous move was RIGHT? Or no: Wait, according to rules, consecutive moves cannot reverse. So if last move was RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT.

So after moving RIGHT from (1,6) → (2,6), the next move can't be LEFT.

From (2,6), possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

But we need to reach x=4 and y=2. So perhaps we should continue moving right towards x=4.

But let's see if that's feasible without collision.

From (2,6):

Move RIGHT → (3,6).

Insert old_head (2,6) into front of body list [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ] → new_body = [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ]

Remove tail because not eating apple → body becomes [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,7) ]

So the snake is now:

Head: (3,6)

Body: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,7) ]

No collision, so that's safe.

Then from (3,6), move RIGHT again to (4,6).

Insert old_head (3,6) into front of body list → new_body = [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,7) ]

Remove tail → body becomes [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ]

Now at (4,6).

But we need to get down to y=2.

So perhaps from here, move DOWN repeatedly.

From (4,6), possible moves: DOWN (to 4,5), but last move was RIGHT, so next can't be LEFT. But moving DOWN is allowed.

Move DOWN → (4,5):

Insert old_head (4,6) into front of body list [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ] → new_body = [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ]

Remove tail → body becomes [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ]

No collision.

Continue moving DOWN:

(4,5) → (4,4)

And so on until y=2.

This seems feasible. Let's see how many steps that would take.

From y=6 to y=2 is 4 moves down (since 6-2=4). So at each step, move DOWN.

But wait, the snake's body is getting longer as we make these moves, so when we reach closer to y=2, we have to ensure that moving further doesn't cause collision with any part of the body except for the tail which will be removed.

Wait no: Each time we move, we insert the old head into the front of the body list and then remove the last element. So as long as the new head doesn't collide with any other part except possibly the tail being cut off, it's safe.

So proceeding this way:

From (4,6) → DOWN to (4,5), body becomes [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ]

Then (4,5) → (4,4), body becomes [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ]

(4,4) → (4,3), body becomes [ (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) ]

(4,3) → (4,2), body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ]

Now at (4,2). But our target is y=2, so we've arrived.

Wait no: Wait, the starting point after moving to (4,6) was the head, and each move down took us further. So from (4,6) → 5 steps down? No: 6→5→4→3→2 is four steps.

Yes, as I said earlier, four moves DOWN.

So in total, from initial position to reaching (4,2), we've made:

1. DOWN
2. RIGHT x3
3. DOWN x4

Wait no: Let's recount the sequence.

First move: DOWN from (1,7) → (1,6)

Second move: RIGHT from (1,6) → (2,6)

Third move: RIGHT from (2,6) → (3,6)

Fourth move: RIGHT from (3,6) → (4,6)

Then four moves DOWN:

5. DOWN → (4,5)
6. DOWN → (4,4)
7. DOWN → (4,3)
8. DOWN → (4,2)

So total of 8 moves.

Is this the shortest path? Let's see: Alternatively, could we have moved differently to reach faster?

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN from initial position, then RIGHT multiple times, but it seems similar steps would be needed.

Another consideration is that sometimes moving UP or DOWN can help navigate around the body if the snake is getting in its own way, but in this case, as long as each new head doesn't collide with existing body parts except for the tail being removed, we're safe.

So perhaps this path works. But I should verify each step for safety:

1. Start at (1,7), move DOWN to (1,6): Safe, no collision.
2. From (1,6) move RIGHT to (2,6): Body is now [ (1,6), (1,7), (2,7) ]. New head at (2,6). No collision.
3. From (2,6) move RIGHT to (3,6): Body becomes [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,7) ]. Head at (3,6). Safe.
4. From (3,6) move RIGHT to (4,6): Body becomes [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ]. Head at (4,6). Safe.
5. From (4,6) move DOWN to (4,5): Body becomes [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ]. Head at (4,5). Safe.
6. From (4,5) move DOWN to (4,4): Body becomes [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ]. Head at (4,4). Safe.
7. From (4,4) move DOWN to (4,3): Body becomes [ (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) ]. Head at (4,3). Safe.
8. From (4,3) move DOWN to (4,2): Body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ]. Head at (4,2). Reached target.

Yes, all steps are safe and reach the destination without collision.

Alternatively, another approach might involve moving LEFT first, but that seems less efficient as it would require more moves to get back rightward. However, let's consider it briefly:

Option 2:

1. Move LEFT from (1,7) → (0,7). But wait: Is x=0 allowed? Or does the grid start at x=1?

Assuming the grid is such that movement off the left side isn't possible, or perhaps wraps around, but for safety, let's assume it doesn't wrap. So moving LEFT from (1,7) would take us to (0,7), which might be allowed.

Now head at (0,7). Body becomes [ (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) ] after first move? Wait no: Let's correct this.

Wait, initial position was (1,7). Moving LEFT to (0,7):

- New head: (0,7)
- Insert old_head (1,7) into front of body list. But wait, the initial body after moving LEFT would be... Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with Option 1 as it seems more straightforward and efficient.

Therefore, the path is:

DOWN → RIGHT → RIGHT → RIGHT → DOWN ×4

Which totals 8 moves.
</think>

The snake can reach the target position (4,2) by moving in a specific sequence. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Move DOWN**: From (1,7) to (1,6)
2. **Move RIGHT**: From (1,6) to (2,6)
3. **Move RIGHT**: From (2,6) to (3,6)
4. **Move RIGHT**: From (3,6) to (4,6)
5. **Move DOWN**: From (4,6) to (4,5)
6. **Move DOWN**: From (4,5) to (4,4)
7. **Move DOWN**: From (4,4) to (4,3)
8. **Move DOWN**: From (4,3) to (4,2)

This sequence ensures the snake doesn't collide with its own body and successfully reaches the target.

**Answer:** The shortest path requires 8 moves. 

The final answer is \boxed{8}.
