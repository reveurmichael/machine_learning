<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from (1,4) to eat the apple at (5,4) without colliding with itself or going out of bounds. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's visualize the grid. The snake is at (1,4), which is somewhere on the left side, and the apple is directly to the right at (5,4). So, ideally, the snake would just move right multiple times to reach the apple. But I need to consider the current body segments and possible collisions.

The snake's body is currently at [(1,3), (1,2)]. That means the snake is two segments long, with the head at (1,4). So when it moves, each segment follows the previous one. If the snake moves right, its new position would be (2,4) for the head, and then the body would shift accordingly.

Wait, but before moving, I need to check if moving in a certain direction is allowed based on the current direction. The current direction is "UP", which means the snake was previously moving upwards. But the first move can't reverse, so from "UP" it can't go "DOWN". So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

But looking at the head's position (1,4), if I try to go UP again, that would take it to (1,5). Let me check the body. The body is at (1,3) and (1,2). If the head moves up, the new head would be (1,5). Is this safe? Well, after moving up, the body would shift: the old head (1,4) becomes the first body segment, then (1,3), etc. The tail would move to (1,2)'s next position, which is probably (1,1) if it's allowed. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT from (1,4) would take the head to (2,4). Let me see if that's safe. The body is at (1,3), so after moving right, the new body list would be [(1,4), (1,3)], and then we remove the tail if not eating an apple. But since the apple is at (5,4), which is in the same row, maybe moving right multiple times is a good idea.

Wait, but I also need to make sure that when the snake grows after eating the apple, it doesn't get trapped. So perhaps planning a path that allows for some flexibility after reaching the apple is important.

Another consideration: The body segments are behind the head in the order [(1,3), (1,2)]. If the head moves right, then the next segment would be at (1,4) (the old head), then (1,3), and so on. So moving right should be safe as long as I don't step into any of these positions except possibly the tail.

Wait, but when the snake is moving, each new head position must not collide with any body segments except potentially the tail if it's about to move. But in this case, after moving right once, the body would adjust so that (1,4) becomes the first body segment, and then (1,3), etc.

So let me outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT from (1,4) to (2,4). This should be safe because none of the body segments are in this new position.
2. Then move RIGHT again to (3,4).
3. Continue moving RIGHT until reaching (5,4), where the apple is.

But wait, each time I move right, the snake's body follows. So after four rights, the head would be at (5,4). Let me check the steps:

- Move 1: RIGHT to (2,4). Body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)].
Wait no, actually when moving, the old head is added to the body list before removing the tail if not eating. So after the first move:

Head moves to (2,4). The body was originally [(1,3), (1,2)]. Now, we add the old head (1,4) to the front of the body list, making it [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. Then, since we're not eating an apple yet, we remove the tail (1,2). So the new body is just [(1,4), (1,3)].

Wait, no. The initial body is [(1,3), (1,2)], which are two segments. After moving right once:

- New head: (2,4).
- Body becomes [old_head] + current_body = [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)].
But since we're not eating an apple, the tail is removed, so body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)]. So now the snake's full S is [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3)].

Next move: RIGHT again to (3,4).

Body after adding old head (2,4) would be [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3)], then remove tail (1,3) since no apple eaten. So body becomes [(2,4), (1,4)].

Wait, but this seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about how the body grows or shrinks based on whether an apple is eaten.

In this case, we're not eating the apple until we reach (5,4). So each move after that would require moving right and then adjusting the body accordingly.

But wait, when we finally eat the apple at (5,4), the body will grow by one segment. That means after eating, the tail won't be removed, so the snake's length increases.

Also, I need to ensure that after eating, there's still a path for the next move to avoid trapping the snake.

So, planning the moves:

1. Move RIGHT four times: from (1,4) → (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). That's four moves in total.

But wait, let me check if each step is safe.

First move: RIGHT to (2,4).

Check collisions:

- New head (2,4) must not be outside bounds. It's within 0-9 for both x and y.
- Check if new_head coincides with any body segments except possibly the tail when it moves.

Current body before moving is [(1,3), (1,2)]. The new head is (2,4). None of the body segments are at (2,4), so no collision. Safe to move.

After this move:

Head: (2,4)
Body: [(1,4), (1,3)] (since we added old head and removed tail)

Second move: RIGHT to (3,4).

Check collisions:

- New head (3,4) is within bounds.
- Current body before moving is [(1,4), (1,3)]. The new head isn't in any of these positions. Safe.

After this move:

Head: (3,4)
Body: [(2,4), (1,4)]

Third move: RIGHT to (4,4).

Check collisions:

- New head (4,4) is safe.
- Current body before moving is [(2,4), (1,4)]. No collision.

After this move:

Head: (4,4)
Body: [(3,4), (2,4)]

Fourth move: RIGHT to (5,4).

Now, new_head is (5,4). Check if it's the apple position. Yes, it is.

So, after moving right four times, we reach the apple.

But wait, each time we move right, we have to add the old head to the body and remove the tail unless we're eating an apple.

Wait, on the fourth move, when we reach (5,4), which is the apple's position, we eat it. So in this case:

- New head: (5,4)
- Current body before moving is [(3,4), (2,4)]
- Add old head (4,4) to front of body: [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]
- Since new_head == apple position, we don't remove the tail. So body becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)].

Wait no, wait:

The initial body after third move is [(3,4), (2,4)]. Then when moving to (5,4):

- Insert old head (4,4) at front → new_body = [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ].
- Since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So the body remains as [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ], and the head is now (5,4).

So the full snake becomes:

Head: (5,4)
Body: [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]

Now, I need to check if after eating, there's at least one legal move next turn. The current direction was "RIGHT" for all four moves, so the last move is "RIGHT". Next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse the direction.

But wait, no: the current direction before the fourth move was "RIGHT", and after moving, the new direction would be "RIGHT" as well (since we didn't change it). So next move can't be LEFT.

Looking at the possible moves from (5,4):

- UP: y+1 → (5,5)
- DOWN: y-1 → (5,3)
- RIGHT: x+1 → (6,4) but that's outside the grid? Wait no, x ranges from 0 to9. So x=5 is within bounds.

Wait, (5,4) moving right would be (6,4), which is valid. But wait, the current direction is "RIGHT", so next move can't be LEFT.

But in this case, after eating the apple at (5,4), what's the surrounding? The head is at (5,4). It can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

Wait, but moving RIGHT from (5,4) would take it to (6,4). But since we just ate the apple and the direction was "RIGHT", the next move can't be LEFT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

But I think for this problem, as long as after eating, there's at least one valid move, which there is (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). So it's okay.

Therefore, moving right four times should work.

Wait, but the initial current direction was "UP". So the first move can't be DOWN. Wait no: the current direction is "UP", so the possible moves for the first step are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but not DOWN as that would reverse). Wait, no: from "UP", you cannot go "DOWN" because that's a reversal.

Wait, no: the initial direction is "UP". So when planning the first move, I can't choose "DOWN".

But in this case, moving RIGHT is allowed, so it's fine.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move RIGHT (from UP)
2. Move RIGHT
3. Move RIGHT
4. Move RIGHT

Wait no: wait, after each move, the direction changes to the new direction. So if I start at "UP", and then first move is RIGHT, then the new direction is RIGHT for subsequent moves.

So yes, that's acceptable.

Therefore, the four right moves should be possible.

But let me double-check:

First move: from (1,4), current direction UP → can't go DOWN. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP? Wait no: when changing direction, you can choose any direction except the opposite of the current direction. So from "UP", you cannot go "DOWN".

Wait no: I think the rule is that you can't reverse direction in one step. So if you're going "UP", next move can't be "DOWN" (since that's a 180-degree turn). But you can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

So for the first move, from "UP", possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

But moving UP again would take the head to (1,5), which is safe as long as it doesn't collide with body segments. The body is at (1,3) and (1,2). So new_head (1,5) isn't in any of those positions. But then after that, the next moves would have to be RIGHT multiple times.

But perhaps moving UP first is not necessary; moving RIGHT directly is better.

Wait, but from "UP", can I choose to move RIGHT? Yes, because that's a 90-degree turn, which is allowed.

So yes, the first move can be RIGHT.

Therefore, the plan is:

1. Move RIGHT to (2,4)
2. Move RIGHT to (3,4)
3. Move RIGHT to (4,4)
4. Move RIGHT to (5,4) and eat the apple.

Each of these steps needs to be checked for safety.

Another consideration: after each move, the body segments follow. So when moving right, the old head becomes part of the body, which could potentially block future moves if not careful. But in this case, since we're moving straight right, the body follows behind, so no collision should occur except possibly when the head reaches (5,4).

Wait, but after each move, the body is adjusted by adding the old head and removing the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So for the first move:

- Head: (1,4) → RIGHT to (2,4)
- Body was [(1,3), (1,2)]
- Add old head (1,4) to front → new body list becomes [ (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]
- Since no apple eaten, remove tail (1,2). So new body is [ (1,4), (1,3) ]

Now the full snake is:

Head: (2,4)
Body: [ (1,4), (1,3) ]

Second move: RIGHT to (3,4)

- Add old head (2,4) → body becomes [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3) ]
- Remove tail (1,3). New body: [ (2,4), (1,4) ]

Head: (3,4)
Body: [ (2,4), (1,4) ]

Third move: RIGHT to (4,4)

- Add old head (3,4) → body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ]
- Remove tail (1,4). New body: [ (3,4), (2,4) ]

Head: (4,4)
Body: [ (3,4), (2,4) ]

Fourth move: RIGHT to (5,4)

- Add old head (4,4) → body becomes [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]
- Since we're at the apple's position, no tail is removed. So body remains [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]

Now, after eating, the snake's length has increased by one segment.

So all four moves are safe, and each step doesn't result in collision except for the new head which only checks against the body segments except possibly the tail when moving.

Wait, no: the rule is that the new head must not collide with any body segments except potentially the tail if it's about to move. But in this case, all moves are straight right, so the body follows behind, and none of the new heads step into their own body segments.

Therefore, the plan should work.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple located directly to its right while avoiding collisions with its own body. The snake can move in four directions but cannot reverse direction immediately. 

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (1,4) moving upwards ("UP"). Its body segments are at positions (1,3) and (1,2).
2. **Movement Constraints**: From the initial direction "UP", the snake can move LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. However, moving DOWN would reverse its direction, which is not allowed.
3. **Path Planning**: The apple is located at (5,4), directly to the right of the snake's starting position. Therefore, moving RIGHT repeatedly is the most straightforward path.
4. **Collision Avoidance**: Each move must ensure that the new head position does not collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail when it moves.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial positions and direction
head = (1, 4)
body = [(1, 3), (1, 2)]
directions = ["UP", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "LEFT"]
current_direction = "UP"

# Function to check if new head position is safe
def is_safe(new_head):
    for segment in body:
        if new_head == segment:
            return False
    # Check boundaries (though not necessary here as they are within 0-9)
    return 0 <= new_head[0] <= 9 and 0 <= new_head[1] <= 9

# Move RIGHT four times to reach the apple
moves = []
for _ in range(4):
    if current_direction == "UP":
        # Can't go DOWN, so choose RIGHT
        new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
        if is_safe(new_head):
            moves.append("RIGHT")
            # Update body and head for next iteration
            body.insert(0, head)
            if not (new_head == (5,4)):  # Only remove tail if not eating apple
                body.pop()
            head = new_head
            current_direction = "RIGHT"  # Update direction after first move
        else:
            break
    elif current_direction == "RIGHT":
        new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])
        if is_safe(new_head):
            moves.append("RIGHT")
            body.insert(0, head)
            if not (new_head == (5,4)):
                body.pop()
            head = new_head
        else:
            break

print(moves)  # Output: ['RIGHT', 'RIGHT', 'RIGHT', 'RIGHT']
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (1,4) with its body segments at (1,3) and (1,2). The initial direction is "UP".
2. **Movement Constraints**: From "UP", the snake can move RIGHT, LEFT, or continue UP. Moving DOWN is prohibited as it would reverse the direction.
3. **Path Planning**: The goal is to reach (5,4) by moving RIGHT four times. Each move updates the head position and adjusts the body segments accordingly.
4. **Collision Check**: Before each move, the new head position is checked against all body segments to ensure no collision except for the tail when it moves.

By following this approach, the snake safely navigates to the apple's location without any collisions, ensuring a successful path completion.
