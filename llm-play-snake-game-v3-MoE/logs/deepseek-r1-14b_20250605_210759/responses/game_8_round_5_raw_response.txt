========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake eat the apple at (4,4) while avoiding collisions. The snake's head is currently at (1,7), and it's moving upward. The body segments are behind it at [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)], which means the snake is in a vertical line from (1,7) down to (1,3). 

First, I need to understand where the apple is relative to the head. The head is at (1,7), and the apple is at (4,4). So, the apple is 3 units to the right (from x=1 to x=4) and 3 units down (from y=7 to y=4). 

Since the snake's current direction is "UP," it can't go "DOWN" next because that would be reversing. So, the possible initial moves are "LEFT," "RIGHT," or continue moving "UP." But since the goal is to reach (4,4), which is diagonally down-right from the head, we'll need a combination of right and down movements.

Looking at the body segments, if I move "UP" again, the snake will extend upwards. However, that doesn't help in reaching the apple, so it's better to start moving towards the apple's direction. 

If I choose "RIGHT," the new head position would be (2,7). But checking for collisions: the body is currently behind the head, and since the tail is at (1,3), moving right shouldn't cause a collision because the body is below. So, moving right seems safe.

After moving right, the body will update by adding the old head position to the front of the body list. Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail will move, so the body remains the same length. Now the snake's head is at (2,7), and the body follows behind.

Next, I should continue moving right or switch directions down. But since the apple is 3 units to the right, perhaps it's better to keep moving right as much as possible. However, each move right brings us closer but also makes the snake longer, which could block paths later on. 

Wait, maybe a different approach: first move "RIGHT" once, then start moving "DOWN." Let me simulate that.

First move: RIGHT from (1,7) to (2,7). Body becomes [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], but wait, no. Wait, the initial body is [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]. When moving right, the new head is (2,7). The old head was (1,7), so it's added to the front of the body. So, the new body list becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ], and since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (1,3). So now the body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: After moving, the head becomes new_head = (2,7). The old head was (1,7), so we insert it into the front of the body list. So, the body becomes [ (1,7) ] + previous_body. But previous_body is [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]. So now, after inserting, it's [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)], but since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the last element (the tail) to keep the body length same. Wait, no: The initial body is 4 segments, so after inserting the old head, it becomes 5, but if not eating an apple, we remove the last, making it back to 4. So, the new body would be [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].

So now, the snake's head is at (2,7) with body following from (1,7) down to (1,4). Next move: perhaps "DOWN" to start moving towards the apple. 

Wait, but since we're moving in a grid, maybe it's better to plan a path that allows the snake to go right three times and then down three times, or something like that. But each time we change direction, we have to ensure we don't collide with our body.

Alternatively, another approach is to move "DOWN" first if possible. Wait, current direction is UP; so I can't move DOWN next because it's reversing. So the initial moves can be RIGHT and then maybe DOWN or continue RIGHT.

Let me try another simulation. If I choose "RIGHT" as the first move, head becomes (2,7). Then, second move can be "RIGHT" again to (3,7), but now, check if that's safe. The body after the first move is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. Moving right again would make new head (3,7). Check collision: Is any of the body cells at (2,7) or (3,7)? No, because the body is from (1,7) down. So it's safe.

Now, after two rights, the head is at (3,7), and the body is [(2,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. Then, perhaps move "DOWN" to start moving towards the apple's y-coordinate.

Wait, but the current direction was RIGHT; can I switch to DOWN? Yes, because it's not a reverse. So third move: DOWN from (3,7) to (3,6). Check collision: The body is [(2,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. None of these are at (3,6), so safe.

Now the head is at (3,6), and the body becomes [(3,7), (2,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. Then, next move: DOWN again to (3,5). But wait, the body now includes (1,6) which is below, but since the tail will move, as long as we don't collide with any other parts except the tail when it moves.

Wait, in this case, moving from (3,7) to (3,6), then (3,5), etc., but I need to ensure that each new head position isn't occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail's current position before movement.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is to move right three times and then down three times. Let me map this out step by step.

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7)
Body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]
No collision.

Move 2: RIGHT → (3,7)
Body becomes [(2,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]
No collision.

Move 3: RIGHT → (4,7)
But wait, the apple is at (4,4). Now, head is at (4,7). Next move could be DOWN.

Move 4: DOWN → (4,6)
Check body: after moving right thrice, the body would have been [(3,7), (2,7), (1,6), (1,5)] before this move. After inserting new head (4,7), body becomes [(3,7), (2,7), (1,6), (1,5)], but since we didn't eat apple, tail is removed. So after moving down to (4,6), the body would be [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,6) ]?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with how the body updates.

Let me clarify:

After each move:
- Insert old head into the front of the body.
- If not eating apple, remove the tail.

So, initial state after first move (RIGHT):
Head: (2,7)
Body: [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]

After second move (RIGHT to 3,7):
Head: (3,7)
Body: [ (2,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]

Wait no. After moving right once, the body is [old_head, ...]. So after first RIGHT, old head was at (1,7). The initial body was [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)], so inserting (1,7) in front makes it [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. Then, since we didn't eat apple, remove the tail (1,4). So body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].

Wait that can't be right because the initial body length was 4. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem statement says that when you move normally, you insert old head into the front of the body and then remove the tail to keep the same length.

So in the example given:

If S = [HEAD (5,5), BODY1 (5,4), BODY2 (5,3)] and direction is RIGHT, new_head is (6,5). Since they didn't eat an apple, the body becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)], but wait no—the example says after moving right, the old head (5,5) is inserted into the front, making the body [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] and then they remove the tail? No, because the initial length was 2, inserting makes it 3, but since no apple, they would keep only the first two? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps when you move normally without eating an apple, the body is updated by adding the new head and removing the last segment to maintain length. So if initial body has N segments, after moving, it becomes [new_head] + body[:-1].

So in our case:

Initial head: (1,7)
Body: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] → 4 segments.

Move RIGHT to (2,7):
New body is [old_head] + body[:-1] = [ (1,7) ] + [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] → length remains 4.

Then, move again RIGHT to (3,7):
Body becomes [ (2,7) ] + previous_body[:-1] = [ (2,7) ] + [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ] → but wait no. Wait, after the first move, body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]? No, because inserting old head makes it 5 segments, then removing tail to keep 4.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused again. Let me check the example from the problem:

In the example, after moving RIGHT, the body becomes [old_head] + previous_body[:-1]. So for our case, initial body is [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. After moving right, insert old head (1,7) into front: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. Then since we didn't eat an apple, remove the last segment (1,4). So new body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].

Wait, but that reduces the body length. The initial body was 3 segments? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how it works. Maybe each move adds a segment and removes one, keeping the same length as before.

In the problem statement, after moving, you insert old head into front of body, then remove tail if not eating apple. So:

If initial body is B with n segments.

After inserting old head, it becomes [old_head] + B, which has n+1 segments.

Then, if not eating apple, remove the last segment (tail), so back to n segments: [old_head] + B[:-1].

So in our case:

Initial body: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] → 4 segments.

After moving right once:

Insert old head (1,7) into front: [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] → 5 segments.

Since no apple eaten, remove last segment: (1,3). So new body is [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] → still 4 segments.

So after first move RIGHT, head is at (2,7), body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].

Second move: RIGHT again to (3,7). Insert old head (2,7): [ (2,7) ] + previous_body → [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]. Remove last segment (1,4), so body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ].

Third move: RIGHT to (4,7). Insert old head (3,7): [ (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ]. Remove last segment (1,5), so body becomes [ (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ].

Now, the head is at (4,7). Next, we need to start moving down towards (4,4). So next move: DOWN.

Move 4: DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6).

Insert old head (4,7): [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ]. Remove last segment (1,6), so body becomes [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7) ].

Now, head is at (4,6). Next move: DOWN to (4,5).

But wait, the body now includes (1,7), which is far away. So no collision.

Move 5: DOWN → (4,5)
Insert old head (4,6): [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]. Remove last segment (2,7). Body becomes [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ].

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps instead of moving all the way right first, we can alternate directions to approach the apple more directly.

Another idea: After moving RIGHT once, then DOWN multiple times.

But considering that the initial direction is UP, and after moving RIGHT, we have flexibility in the next moves as long as we don't reverse. So let me try:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7)
Body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]

Move 2: DOWN → (2,6)
Insert old head (2,7) → body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ]
Check collision: new head is (2,6). Body is [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. None are at (2,6), so safe.

Move 3: DOWN → (2,5)
Insert old head (2,6): [ (2,6), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ]
Body becomes after removing tail: [ (2,6), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ].

Wait, but moving from (2,5) to (2,4):

Move 4: DOWN → (2,4)
Insert old head (2,5): [ (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (1,7) ]
Body becomes after removing tail: [ (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (1,7) ].

But the apple is at (4,4). So we need to move right twice and down thrice. But with the head moving towards (2,4), it's not on the same path as the apple.

This approach might make the snake take a longer route or even collide with itself if not careful.

Perhaps a better plan is to first get into position where the head can be at (4,7) and then move down three times. Let's simulate that:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7)
Body: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]

Move 2: RIGHT → (3,7)
Body: [(2,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]

Wait no, after first move to (2,7), body is [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]. After moving right again, insert old head (2,7): [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ], then remove tail (1,5). So body is [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].

Wait, this seems to complicate things. Maybe it's better to move right three times and down three times without worrying about the exact body positions, but ensuring that each new head position doesn't collide with any body except possibly the tail before movement.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a diagonal path isn't possible since each move is either horizontal or vertical. So I need to plan a sequence of moves where the head moves right and down alternately or in some order without causing collision.

Another approach: The snake's current direction is UP, so it can't go DOWN next. Therefore, the first move must be RIGHT or continue moving UP.

If we choose to continue moving UP:

Move 1: UP → (1,8)
But wait, y=8 might be beyond the grid? Or maybe not; depends on the grid size. Assuming it's possible, body becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ].

Then next move can be RIGHT to start moving towards the apple. But this seems counterproductive as we're moving away from the apple.

Therefore, better to first move RIGHT.

So plan:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7)
Body becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]

Move 2: DOWN → (2,6)
Insert old head (2,7): body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ]
Check for collision at (2,6). Current body includes (2,7) which is adjacent but not same as (2,6). So safe.

Move 3: DOWN → (2,5)
Insert old head (2,6): [ (2,6), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ]
Body becomes after removing tail: [ (2,6), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ].

But wait, now body has segment at (1,6). If we move right from here:

Move 4: RIGHT → (3,5)
Insert old head (2,5): [ (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (1,7) ]
Body becomes after removing tail: [ (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (1,7) ].

Now, the head is at (3,5). Next moves could be down and right.

Move 5: DOWN → (3,4)
Insert old head (3,5): [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) ]
Body becomes after removing tail: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) ].

Move 6: RIGHT → (4,4)
Insert old head (3,4): [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ]
Body becomes after removing tail: [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ].

But the apple is at (4,4). So we need to make two more moves:

Move 7: RIGHT → (5,4)
But wait, that's not necessary. Alternatively, after reaching (4,4), but in this case, it seems like an extra move.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the path. Let me re-express:

After Move 6: head at (3,4). Then to reach (4,4):

Move 7: RIGHT → (4,4)
But wait, that's not adjacent; from (3,4), moving right is to (4,4). So yes.

So total moves would be 7 steps:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. RIGHT
5. DOWN
6. RIGHT
7. RIGHT

Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me outline each move with the position and body segments.

But this seems time-consuming. Alternatively, considering that from (1,7), moving right thrice would bring us to (4,7), then down three times to (4,4). So 6 moves in total: 3 rights and 3 downs.

Let me check:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7)
Body becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]

Wait no, after moving right once, body is [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ].

Move 2: RIGHT → (3,7)
Insert old head (2,7): [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ]
Remove tail (1,5). Body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ].

Wait no, initial body was 4 segments. After inserting and removing tail, it's still 3? I'm confused again.

Perhaps a better way is to realize that each move adds one segment at the front and removes one from the end if not eating an apple, thus keeping the body length constant.

Therefore, after several moves, the body will be shifted accordingly without changing its length.

Thus, moving right three times would shift the head to (4,7) while the rest of the body follows. Then moving down three times would bring the head to (4,4).

So in total:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7)
Body becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] → but wait, initial body is [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] or similar? No, original position was head at (1,7), followed by (1,6), etc.

Actually, the snake's body is a sequence. So after moving right, the head moves to (2,7), and the next segments are (1,7), (1,6), (1,5).

Wait no, perhaps it's better to think of the snake as a list where each move adds the new head at the front and removes the last segment unless food is eaten.

So in this problem, since we're not considering eating food (as the task is just movement), each move shifts the body forward by one, keeping the length same.

Therefore, starting at (1,7) with body segments following as [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].

Move 1: RIGHT → head moves to (2,7). Body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ].

But wait, that's adding a new segment at front and keeping the rest, but then we need to remove the last one since no food is eaten. So body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ].

Wait, initial length was 3? Or 4?

Wait, in the problem statement, it's not specified how long the snake is initially. Hmm, this complicates things.

Assuming that the snake has a certain length, but for movement purposes, each move shifts the body by one segment without changing its length unless food is eaten.

But since the task doesn't involve eating, just moving, perhaps we can ignore the body's segments beyond ensuring that the new head position isn't on the current body path.

Therefore, to plan a safe path from (1,7) to (4,4), avoiding self-collision.

Possible moves:

Move RIGHT three times and DOWN three times. But the order matters to avoid crossing over itself.

One possible sequence is R, D, R, D, R, D.

Let's simulate:

Start: head at (1,7). Body segments are [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ].

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7)
Check body: does (2,7) collide with any of [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]? No.
Body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ]

Wait, no—body is updated by adding new head and removing tail. So if initial body was [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ], after moving right:

new_head = (2,7)
new_body = [new_head] + previous_body[:-1] → [ (2,7), (1,6), (1,5) ]

Wait no, because the snake's body is [head] followed by segments. So when moving, new head is added at front, and last segment is removed if length remains same.

If initial body was of length N=3: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ].

After moving right:

new_head = (2,7)
new_body = [ (2,7), (1,6), (1,5) ] → removing last segment (1,4).

So body is now [ (2,7), (1,6), (1,5) ].

Move 2: DOWN → (2,6)
Check collision with new_body except head:

new_head = (2,6)
body segments after moving: [ (1,6), (1,5) ]

But wait, when we move down from (2,7), the new body would be [ (2,6), (2,7), (1,6) ] but then remove last segment if not eating. So:

new_head = (2,6)
previous_body = [ (2,7), (1,6), (1,5) ]

new_body = [ (2,6), (2,7), (1,6) ]
then remove last segment: [ (2,6), (2,7), (1,6) ] becomes [ (2,6), (2,7) ].

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps each move shifts the body segments forward. So when moving right, all segments move right by one, with head leading.

But in that case, for a snake of length 3:

Initial: [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ]

Move RIGHT:
New positions:

(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)

Wait no, because each segment follows the previous one. So moving right would shift each segment to the next column.

But perhaps it's better to model the snake as a list where each move shifts all segments in the direction of movement.

Alternatively, maybe I should just focus on the head position and ensure that in each step, the new head doesn't land on any part of its own body.

Therefore, starting at (1,7), after:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7) – safe
Move 2: DOWN → (2,6) – check if this is on previous body [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]? Wait no, previous body after move 1 was [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ].

Wait, actually, I think the confusion comes from not knowing the initial snake length. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps it's sufficient to plan a path that moves right three times and down three times in an order that avoids crossing over itself.

So one way is R, R, R, D, D, D.

Let me simulate:

Start: head at (1,7). Body = [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,7)
Body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ]
Check collision? No.

Move 2: RIGHT → (3,7)
Body becomes [ (3,7), (2,7), (1,7) ]
No collision.

Move 3: RIGHT → (4,7)
Body becomes [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]
No collision.

Now, we need to move down three times:

Move 4: DOWN → (4,6)
Check body segments: [ (3,7), (2,7) ] – no collision. So safe.
Body becomes [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Move 5: DOWN → (4,5)
Check body segments: [ (4,7), (3,7) ] – no collision.
Body becomes [ (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) ]

Move 6: DOWN → (4,4)
Check body segments: [ (4,6), (4,7) ] – no collision. So safe.

Thus, after six moves, the snake's head is at (4,4), which is the target position.

Therefore, the movement sequence is RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.
</think>

The optimal path to move from (1,7) to (4,4) without self-collision involves moving right three times and then down three times. This ensures that each new head position does not overlap with any part of the snake's body.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake's head is at (1,7), followed by body segments extending downwards to (1,4).

2. **Move 1 - RIGHT:** 
   - Head moves to (2,7).
   - Body updates to [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ].
   - No collision detected.

3. **Move 2 - RIGHT:** 
   - Head moves to (3,7).
   - Body updates to [ (3,7), (2,7), (1,7) ].
   - No collision detected.

4. **Move 3 - RIGHT:** 
   - Head moves to (4,7).
   - Body updates to [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ].
   - No collision detected.

5. **Move 4 - DOWN:** 
   - Head moves to (4,6).
   - Body updates to [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ].
   - No collision detected.

6. **Move 5 - DOWN:** 
   - Head moves to (4,5).
   - Body updates to [ (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) ].
   - No collision detected.

7. **Move 6 - DOWN:** 
   - Head moves to (4,4).
   - Body updates to [ (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) ].
   - Target reached without collisions.

**Answer:**

The snake should move right three times followed by down three times. The sequence is:

RIGHT → RIGHT → RIGHT → DOWN → DOWN → DOWN

So the final answer is:

\boxed{R,R,R,D,D,D}
