<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how this snake can reach the apple at (7,2) from its current position at (7,8). The snake's body is given as [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)], so that's six segments behind the head. The direction right now is "LEFT".

First, I need to understand where the snake can move without getting into trouble. Since it's currently moving left, its next moves are restricted a bit because reversing direction isn't allowed unless it's the first move. So from "LEFT", it can't go "RIGHT" again unless that would cause an immediate collision.

The goal is to reach (7,2). Let me plot this on a grid. The head is at (7,8), and the apple is at (7,2). So vertically, the snake needs to move down 6 units because y decreases from 8 to 2. Since it's starting at x=7, which is the middle column, moving left or right isn't necessary; the main focus should be on moving downward.

But wait, the snake is currently moving left from (7,8). If it continues moving left, it'll go towards higher y-values because moving left in this coordinate system would take it to x=6,5,... but that's away from the apple. That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the direction.

Wait, no. The movement is based on the current direction vector. "LEFT" means x decreases by 1 each step. So from (7,8), moving left would take it to (6,8). But that's not towards the apple at (7,2). Hmm, perhaps I need to change direction.

But wait, according to the movement rules, you can't reverse direction on the first move unless the current direction is "NONE". Since the snake is currently moving "LEFT", the next move cannot be "RIGHT" because that would reverse. So from "LEFT", it can choose "UP", "DOWN", or continue "LEFT".

But moving left isn't helpful for reaching (7,2). So maybe after some moves, change direction to down. Let me think about possible paths.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake should first move right to get closer to the center column where the apple is located. Wait, but the head is at x=7, which is already in the middle. Moving left would take it away, and moving right from there isn't helpful because that's towards higher x-values. But actually, no—the apple is at (7,2), same x-coordinate as the head.

So maybe moving straight down would be better. The current direction is "LEFT", but to move down, the snake needs to change direction from "LEFT" to "DOWN". However, changing direction from "LEFT" to "DOWN" isn't allowed because they are perpendicular movements—like turning 90 degrees. Wait, no—the movement rules don't explicitly forbid changing direction as long as it's not a reversal.

Wait, let me recheck the rules: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if the current direction is "LEFT", moving down isn't a reversal. So that's allowed.

So perhaps the snake can change direction to "DOWN" after some moves and then proceed towards (7,2). But wait, initially, the snake is at (7,8), moving left would take it to (6,8), which is not helpful. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no—the movement is determined by the direction vector. So if the snake changes direction to "DOWN", its next move will be (7,8) -> (7,7). That's down one unit. Then from there, it can continue moving down or change direction again.

But I need to make sure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail if it's about to move. Also, when eating the apple, the snake must not get trapped in the next move.

Let me try to plan a path:

1. Current position: (7,8), direction "LEFT".
2. First, I might need to change direction from "LEFT" to "DOWN" because moving left isn't helpful for reaching the apple which is below.
But wait, moving left from (7,8) would take it away from the apple. So maybe the first move should be changing direction.

Wait, but according to rule 2: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So since the snake is currently moving left, can it change direction to down? Yes, because it's not a reversal. So perhaps after some moves, switch directions.

Alternatively, maybe the initial move should be "DOWN".

But wait, the snake is at (7,8), and its body is in front of it. The first move needs to avoid colliding with itself.

If it moves down from (7,8) to (7,7), check if that's safe. The body segments are [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)]. So the snake's body is on the east side of the head, so moving down would be into an empty space. That seems safe.

Then, after that, the snake can continue moving down towards the apple.

But wait, let me think about the movement step-by-step.

Another approach: The snake needs to reach (7,2). The vertical distance is 6 units down from (7,8) to (7,2). The horizontal position is already correct. So perhaps the snake should change direction immediately from "LEFT" to "DOWN" and proceed straight down.

But since moving left first would take it away, maybe that's not ideal. Alternatively, can the snake first move down, then continue moving down?

Yes. Because changing direction from "LEFT" to "DOWN" is allowed as it's not a reversal.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Current position: (7,8), direction "LEFT".
2. First, change direction to "DOWN". So the next move would be (7,8) -> (7,7).
3. Check if that's safe: new head is (7,7). It's within bounds and not occupied by any body segments except possibly the tail when it moves.
4. Since it's the first move, no collision as long as the new position isn't blocked by itself.

Wait, but initially, the snake has a body of six segments. So after moving down to (7,7), the new head is added, and then the body shifts. The old head becomes part of the body.

So in this case, the body would be [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)] before moving. After moving down to (7,7):

- Insert old head (7,8) at front: body becomes [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)]? Wait no—the initial body is provided as [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)], which are the segments behind the head. So when moving, the old head becomes BODY1.

So after moving to (7,7):

- The new head is (7,7).
- Insert old head (7,8) at front of body: body becomes [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)].
Wait, no—the initial body has 6 segments. After inserting the old head, it becomes 7 segments.

But then, if the snake doesn't eat the apple, it must remove the tail. So in this case, since it's not eating the apple, the tail (4,9) is removed, making the body length back to 6: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9)].

So after moving down once, the snake's position is at (7,7).

Then, from there, continue moving down.

Next move: direction "DOWN" again. New head would be (7,6). Check if that's safe.

The new head is (7,6). The body after previous step was [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9)].

So inserting old head (7,7) at front: body becomes [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9)]. Then, since it's not eating the apple, remove the tail (5,9): body becomes [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)].

Continue this process until reaching y=2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient path. But since the goal is to reach (7,2) safely, let me outline each step:

1. Initial position: (7,8), direction "LEFT".
2. Move down to (7,7).
3. Move down to (7,6).
4. Move down to (7,5).
5. Move down to (7,4).
6. Move down to (7,3).
7. Move down to (7,2).

But wait, each time the snake moves down, it's adding a new body segment unless it eats the apple.

However, since in these steps, it isn't eating the apple, so each move adds one more body segment until y=2.

Wait, but when it reaches y=2, that's the target. So it can stop there? Or does it need to avoid being trapped?

At (7,2), after moving from (7,3):

- New head is (7,2).
- Insert old head (7,3) at front: body becomes [(7,3), (7,8), ... all previous segments].
- Since it's the apple, can eat it. So when it eats the apple, does it affect movement? No—eating the apple just means it stops being generated as a segment.

Wait, no—the rule is that after eating the apple, the segment is removed. But since (7,2) is the target, maybe we don't need to have any segments beyond that.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can reach (7,2) by moving down 6 times.

But each move down requires checking for collisions.

Wait, let me think again.

Each time it moves down:

- New head at (7,y+1).
- Insert old head as new BODY1.
- If not eating apple, remove the last segment.

So if the snake doesn't eat the apple, the body segments increase by one each move.

But if it does eat the apple, then in that step, it can consume the apple and possibly have a shorter body.

Wait, no. The rule is: when you eat the apple, you lose a body segment. So if the snake moves into (7,2), which is the apple, it eats it and thus loses one segment.

But in this case, to reach (7,2), the last move would be from (7,3). So:

- Current position: (7,3), direction "DOWN".
- New head at (7,2): eat the apple, so body becomes [(7,3), ... previous segments except the last one].

Wait, but after moving to (7,2), it's the end of the snake, so perhaps no more movement is needed.

But I need to make sure that when the snake moves into (7,2), its next move isn't blocked by any body parts.

So let me try to simulate:

1. Initial position: (7,8), direction "LEFT".
   - Body segments behind head: [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)].
2. Change direction to "DOWN", move to (7,7).
   - Insert old head (7,8) at front of body: new body is [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)].
   - Since it's not eating the apple, remove last segment (4,9): new body is [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9)].
3. Next move: direction "DOWN" to (7,6).
   - Insert old head (7,7) at front: [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9)].
   - Remove last segment (5,9): new body is [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)].
4. Next move: direction "DOWN" to (7,5).
   - Insert old head (7,6) at front: [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)].
   - Remove last segment (6,9): new body is [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9)].
5. Next move: direction "DOWN" to (7,4).
   - Insert old head (7,5) at front: [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9)].
   - Remove last segment (7,9): new body is [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)].
6. Next move: direction "DOWN" to (7,3).
   - Insert old head (7,4) at front: [(7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)].
   - Remove last segment (8,9): new body is [(7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8)].
7. Next move: direction "DOWN" to (7,2).
   - Insert old head (7,3) at front: [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8)].
   - Since this is the apple, eat it. So remove one segment from the body: becomes [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)].

Now, at (7,2), and the body is six segments again.

Next move: since direction was "DOWN", but it just ate the apple. So after eating, can it change direction? Yes, because it's not a reversal.

Wait, no—the rule about changing direction applies regardless of whether you ate the apple or not, as long as it's not reversing.

So now, at (7,2), with direction "DOWN", but the next move would be to (7,1). However, we don't need to go further because the goal is achieved. So perhaps the snake can stop here.

But the problem statement says you have to reach (7,2). So maybe that's sufficient.

Wait, no—the snake must navigate through each segment without colliding with itself or getting stuck.

But in this simulation, it seems possible. However, I need to make sure that at each step, moving down doesn't cause any collision.

Looking back, when the snake moves down from (7,8) to (7,7), the body is inserted as [(7,8), ...]. The previous body was behind, so no collision.

Similarly for each subsequent move, since all body segments are either in front or behind, not crossing over.

Also, after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail if it's about to move. But since we're always moving down, and the tail is at lower y-values, there's no issue.

So this seems like a viable path.

But wait, let me count how many moves that is: from (7,8) to (7,2) is 6 moves down.

And each time, except the last move where it eats the apple, it adds a segment. The last move, after eating, removes one segment.

So in total, the snake would have added segments up to (7,3), then when moving into (7,2), it eats and removes a segment.

Thus, the path is feasible.

Alternatively, could there be a shorter path? Maybe not, because the vertical distance is 6 units.

But let me think if changing direction earlier can help. For example, maybe after some left moves to get out of the way, then moving down.

Wait, but initially, the snake is at (7,8). If it goes left once: (6,8). Then can change direction to down.

From (6,8), moving down would take it to (6,7). But that's further away from the target. Also, the body would extend more to the east.

But perhaps after that, it can change direction back right or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can move left once, then up, but that seems counterproductive.

Wait, let me think about the rule again: you cannot reverse direction unless it's the first move and current direction is "NONE". So from "LEFT", next move can be "DOWN" or continue "LEFT" or "UP"? Wait, movement vectors: "DOWN" is south, so moving down doesn't conflict with left.

Wait, no—the movement rules don't say that. It just says you cannot reverse direction like from "UP" to "DOWN" or "LEFT" to "RIGHT". So from "LEFT", changing to "DOWN" is allowed because it's a different perpendicular direction.

So perhaps the snake can first move down a few times, but I think moving straight down without reversing is more efficient.

Alternatively, maybe trying to go right isn't helpful since x=7 is already in the middle. Wait, no—moving right from (7,8) would take it to higher x-values, which are towards (14,y), not helpful for reaching (7,2).

So I think the initial plan of moving down straight is better.

So summarizing:

- Change direction from "LEFT" to "DOWN".
- Move down each step until reach (7,2).
- On the last move, eat the apple and adjust body segments accordingly.
- Ensure that no collisions occur at any point.

Therefore, the path seems possible with six downward moves. The number of segments added is manageable as shown in the simulation above.

So I think this is a valid solution.
</think>

To solve the problem of navigating from (7,8) to (7,2) without reversing direction and avoiding self-collision, follow these steps:

1. **Change Direction**: Initially at (7,8), switch from moving left to moving down.
2. **Move Down**: Proceed one step south at a time, ensuring no collisions with the body segments behind.
3. **Eat Apple**: Upon reaching (7,2), eat the apple to eliminate the last segment, allowing safe termination.

**Path**:
- From (7,8) → (7,7) → (7,6) → (7,5) → (7,4) → (7,3) → (7,2).

By following this route, you avoid reversing direction and navigate safely to the target.
