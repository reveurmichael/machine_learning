========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to help the snake get from (5,5) to eat the apple at (4,5). Let's start by understanding the current situation.

The head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (4,5). So, in terms of x-coordinate, the apple is one unit to the left. Y-coordinate is the same, so no need to move up or down. 

First, I should check the movement rules. The current direction is NONE, which means any move is allowed on the first step. But wait, the constraint says that the snake cannot reverse direction. So if the first move is in a certain direction, the next one can't be the opposite.

Looking at the current head position and apple position: since the apple is directly to the left of the head, moving LEFT seems straightforward. However, I need to consider the body cells and possible collisions. The body cells are empty right now, so that's not an issue immediately.

Wait, the initial state says the body cells are an empty list. So the snake is just the head; no body segments. That makes it easier because there's no risk of collision with the body unless we move in a way that the new head position overlaps with any part of the body. But since the body is empty, movement-wise, only grid boundaries matter.

So moving LEFT would take the head to (4,5), which is exactly where the apple is. That should be possible as long as it's within bounds and doesn't reverse direction. Since the current direction is NONE, moving LEFT is allowed.

But wait, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment. So after this move, the tail remains because the apple was eaten. The body would then include the previous head position (5,5) as a new segment, making the body [(5,5)]. But since there's only two segments now (head at 4,5 and body at 5,5), no collision is possible.

However, I need to ensure that after eating the apple, the snake can still move. The final position must have at least one legal move afterward. Since the snake grows by one segment when it eats, but in this case, since it was a single cell before, now it's two cells: (4,5) and (5,5). So from (4,5), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT as long as they don't go out of bounds.

But wait, after moving to (4,5), the snake can't immediately reverse direction. Wait, noâ€”reversing is only about consecutive moves. The first move was NONE, so next move's direction isn't restricted unless we choose a direction that would cause it.

Wait, in this case, since the apple is directly to the left, moving LEFT once gets us there. So the moves list can just be ["LEFT"].

But I should double-check if any constraints are violated. For example, after eating the apple, the snake has two segments: (4,5) and (5,5). From (4,5), possible next moves would be to check for collisions with the body. Moving LEFT again would take it to (3,5), which is outside the grid? No, because x can go from 0 to 9, so that's okay.

But in this case, since we only have one move, maybe that's all that's needed.

Wait, but according to the constraints, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move afterward. So if I just take one move to reach (4,5), then what? The snake is now two segments long. From (4,5), possible moves are:

- UP: (4,6)
- DOWN: (4,4)
- LEFT: (3,5)
- RIGHT: (5,5) but that's the body segment, so collision.

So from (4,5), moving RIGHT would collide with (5,5). So after eating the apple, can we still move? Yes, because UP, DOWN, or LEFT are possible. So as long as the path doesn't immediately reverse into a collision, it's okay.

But in this case, since we only need to reach the apple, and the first move is sufficient, perhaps that's all needed.

Wait, but according to the final position check, the number of LEFT moves minus RIGHT moves should be 1 (since x went from 5 to 4). That's satisfied by one LEFT move. The y-coordinate didn't change, so UPs minus DOWNs should be 0, which is also satisfied.

So I think moving LEFT once is sufficient.

The snake needs only one move to the left to reach the apple without any risks of collision or grid boundaries being violated. 

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving directly left from (5,5) to (4,5) safely reaches the apple with no body segments in the way."
}
