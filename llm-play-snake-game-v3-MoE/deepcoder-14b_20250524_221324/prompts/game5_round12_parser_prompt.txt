<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The snake is at (0,7) and needs to get to the apple at (4,5). First, I'll note that the head is at (0,7), which is on the left side of the grid, and the apple is somewhere in the middle.

The current direction is "UP," so the snake's next move can't be "DOWN" because you can't reverse directions. That means from the starting point, possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But since the head is at (0,7), moving LEFT isn't possible because x=0 is the leftmost column. So initial options are UP or RIGHT.

Looking at the body cells: [(0,6), (0,5)]. The snake's body extends from (0,6) behind the head down to (0,5). Wait, no—the body list starts with the segment immediately behind the head. So the head is at (0,7), then the next body part is (0,6), and then (0,5). That means the snake is currently in a vertical line from (0,5) to (0,7).

If the current direction is UP, that would mean the head was moving up from (0,6) to (0,7). So if we continue moving UP, the new head would be at (0,8), which is within bounds. But I need to check for collisions.

Wait, after moving UP, the body will shift. The old head (0,7) becomes the first body segment, then (0,6), and so on. So if we move UP again, the new head would be at (0,8). Is that safe? Let's see: the new head is (0,8). The current body includes (0,6) and (0,5), which are below the head, but since we're moving up, those positions won't interfere with the new head. So maybe moving UP again is okay.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,7). Let's see if that's possible. The body parts after this move would be (0,7), then (0,6), and (0,5). So the new head at (1,7) wouldn't collide with any of those.

But wait, I also need to consider future moves. Since the apple is at (4,5), which is to the right and a bit down from the current head position. So perhaps moving towards the right would be more efficient.

Wait, the snake's body might block some paths if it gets too long. Currently, the snake has three segments: head, (0,6), and (0,5). If we move in a way that grows the snake, we have to make sure that after eating the apple, there's still space for the tail to move without getting stuck.

Let me outline possible paths:

Option 1: Move RIGHT first. From (0,7) to (1,7). Then continue moving right towards (4,7), then down to (4,5).

But wait, after moving RIGHT once, the body would shift. The new head is at (1,7), and the body becomes [(0,7), (0,6)]. Then, if we move RIGHT again, the next position is (2,7), with the body now being [(1,7), (0,7)], etc.

But I need to make sure that each step doesn't cause a collision. Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so I have to ensure there's enough space around for the tail not to block the path.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first is better. From (0,7) up to (0,8), then right towards (4,8), but that might take more steps and could potentially lead into a corner if not careful.

Wait, another consideration: the apple is at (4,5). The Manhattan distance from (0,7) is |4-0| + |5-7| = 4 + 2 =6. So the minimal path would be 6 moves, but we have to account for the body movement and possible detours.

Let me try to plan a step-by-step path:

1. First move: RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7). No collision because the body is at (0,6), (0,5), which are not in the way.

2. Next move: RIGHT again to (2,7).

3. Continue moving right: (3,7), then (4,7).

Now, from (4,7), we need to go down to reach y=5. But wait, when the snake is at (4,7) with the apple at (4,5), how will the body affect this?

After each move to the right, the body grows or shifts. Since the apple is at (4,5), which is directly below (4,6). So perhaps after reaching (4,7), we can start moving down.

But wait, when the snake reaches (4,7), its body would be a long line from (0,7) all the way to (something else). Wait no: each time we move right without eating an apple, the tail moves as well. So after four rights, the head is at (4,7), and the body would have moved accordingly.

Wait, initial body after first move:

- Head: (1,7)
- Body: [(0,7), (0,6), (0,5)]

Wait no, wait: when you make a move, the old head is added to the front of the body list. Then if not growing, the tail is removed.

So initial state before any moves:

Head: (0,7)
Body: [(0,6), (0,5)]

After moving RIGHT once:
New head: (1,7)
Body becomes [old_head] + current_body => [(0,7), (0,6), (0,5)]
But since we didn't eat an apple (apple is at (4,5)), the tail (0,5) is removed. So body after first move is [(0,7), (0,6)].

Wait no: step 3 in movement update says:

a. Insert old head position at front of BODY list (becomes BODY1).

b. If new_head == apple, grow; else, remove last element (the tail) to keep length same.

So after first move (RIGHT), body becomes [ (0,7), (0,6), (0,5) ] because we inserted the old head at front? Wait no: initial body is [(0,6), (0,5)].

Wait, the initial S is [HEAD (0,7), BODY1 (0,6), BODY2 (0,5)]. So when you move RIGHT:

new_head = (1,7).

Then, insert old head (0,7) at front of the body list. The current body is [(0,6), (0,5)], so inserting 0,7 makes it [ (0,7), (0,6), (0,5) ].

But since new_head != apple (which is at (4,5)), we remove the tail (0,5). So the new body after this move is [ (0,7), (0,6) ].

So now S is:

Head: (1,7)
Body: [(0,7), (0,6)]

Wait no, wait. The full snake S is [HEAD] + BODY list. After inserting old head at front of the body list, which was initially [(0,6), (0,5)], becomes [ (0,7) ] + [ (0,6), (0,5) ], but then we remove the last element because not growing.

Wait no: step 3a says insert old head to front of BODY list. So the current body is [(0,6), (0,5)]. Inserting (0,7) at front makes it [ (0,7), (0,6), (0,5) ].

But since we didn't eat an apple, step 3c says remove last element of BODY. So after this move, the body becomes [ (0,7), (0,6) ].

Wait no: wait, the old head is inserted at front, making the new body list as [ (0,7), (0,6), (0,5) ], but then we remove the last element (the tail) because we're not growing. So the final body after this move would be [ (0,7), (0,6) ].

Wait no: initial body is [(0,6), (0,5)]. After inserting old head (0,7) at front, it's [ (0,7), (0,6), (0,5) ]. Then, since new_head != apple, we remove the last element. So the new body is [ (0,7), (0,6) ].

So now, S is:

Head: (1,7)
Body: [ (0,7), (0,6) ]

Wait no: no, because after inserting old head at front of BODY list, which was [(0,6), (0,5)], it becomes [ (0,7), (0,6), (0,5) ].

Then, since new_head is not apple, we remove the last element. So body becomes [ (0,7), (0,6) ].

Wait no: wait, after inserting old head at front of the BODY list (which was [(0,6), (0,5)]), it's now [ (0,7), (0,6), (0,5) ]. Then, we remove the last element (the tail) because not growing. So body is now [ (0,7), (0,6) ].

So S after first move:

Head: (1,7)
Body: [ (0,7), (0,6) ]

Wait no, wait: the full snake would be Head followed by the new body list, which is [ (0,7), (0,6) ]. But that can't be right because moving from (1,7), and the body parts are at (0,7) and (0,6). That seems okay.

Wait no: wait, the head is now at (1,7), and the body is [ (0,7), (0,6) ]. So when you move again, say RIGHT to (2,7), then:

New_head = (2,7)

Insert old head (1,7) into front of current body list: [ (1,7), (0,7), (0,6) ]

Since new_head is not apple, remove last element: body becomes [ (1,7), (0,7) ]

So S now:

Head: (2,7)
Body: [ (1,7), (0,7) ]

This seems okay.

Continuing this way, moving right each time. After four rights, head is at (4,7). Body would be:

Each move adds the previous head to front and removes last element if no growth.

So after each right, body list increases by one in front but loses one at end unless we grow.

Wait, actually, for each move that doesn't involve eating the apple, the body list's length remains the same as initial. Wait, initial body has two segments: [(0,6), (0,5)]. After first move, it becomes [ (0,7), (0,6) ]—still two segments.

Wait no, wait:

Initial S:

Head: (0,7)
Body: [ (0,6), (0,5) ]

After moving RIGHT once:

New_head: (1,7)

Insert old head (0,7) at front of body list: becomes [ (0,7), (0,6), (0,5) ]

But since new_head != apple, remove last element: so body is now [ (0,7), (0,6) ].

So after first move, the body has two segments again. Then moving right again:

New head: (2,7)

Insert old head (1,7) at front of current body list: [ (1,7), (0,7), (0,6) ]

Remove last element: [ (1,7), (0,7) ]

So now the body is two segments again.

Similarly, moving right to (3,7):

Insert old head (2,7) at front: [ (2,7), (1,7), (0,7) ]

Remove last element: [ (2,7), (1,7) ]

Then move right to (4,7):

Insert old head (3,7) at front: [ (3,7), (2,7), (1,7) ]

Remove last element: [ (3,7), (2,7) ]

So after four rights, body is [ (3,7), (2,7) ].

Wait no, wait:

Wait, each time you move right, the head moves, and the body follows. So the body segments are always one less than the number of moves, but in this case, it's maintaining two segments.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe another approach: plan a path that avoids collision with the body and reaches the apple.

Another idea: Since the apple is at (4,5), which is directly below (4,6). So perhaps after reaching (4,7), we can move down to (4,6) then (4,5).

But when moving down from (4,7), I have to make sure that the body doesn't block this path.

Wait, but if the snake's body is at [ (3,7), (2,7) ] after four rights, moving down would take head to (4,6). Then check for collisions:

The new head is (4,6). The current body is [ (3,7), (2,7) ], so no collision.

But wait, when you move down from (4,7), the new head is at (4,6). Insert old head (4,7) into front of body: [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]

Since we're not growing yet (unless we reach apple), remove last element: so body becomes [ (4,7), (3,7) ].

Wait no: when you move down from (4,7), the new head is (4,6). The old head was (4,7). So:

Insert (4,7) at front of current body list. Current body before this move is [ (3,7), (2,7) ].

Wait no: let me retrace:

After four rights:

Head: (4,7)

Body: [ (3,7), (2,7) ]

Now moving down to (4,6):

new_head = (4,6)

Insert old head (4,7) at front of body list: [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]

Since new_head != apple, remove last element: body becomes [ (4,7), (3,7) ]

So now S is:

Head: (4,6)

Body: [ (4,7), (3,7) ]

Wait, that seems okay. Then next move down to (4,5):

new_head = (4,5)

Check for collisions with body parts: current body after insertion would be [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ].

But wait no:

Wait, when moving from (4,6) down to (4,5):

Insert old head (4,6) at front of current body list. Current body before this move was [ (4,7), (3,7) ].

So after inserting, it becomes [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Then, since new_head is not apple yet (unless we're at (4,5)), but in this case, the apple is at (4,5). So if new_head == apple, we grow; else, remove last element.

Wait no: when you reach (4,5), that's the apple. So new_head == apple, so step 3b says we add without removing the tail.

So movement steps:

1. RIGHT to (1,7)

2. RIGHT to (2,7)

3. RIGHT to (3,7)

4. RIGHT to (4,7)

5. DOWN to (4,6)

6. DOWN to (4,5) - eat apple

At step 6, when moving down from (4,6) to (4,5):

new_head = (4,5), which is the apple.

So:

Insert old head (4,6) at front of current body list: [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Since new_head == apple, we don't remove the tail. So body becomes [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ].

Wait no: initial body before this move was [ (4,7), (3,7) ]. After inserting old head (4,6) at front, it's [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

But since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So body is now [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ].

Wait no: no, wait step 3:

a. Insert old head at front of BODY list.

b. If new_head == apple, grow (i.e., keep the inserted head without removing anything).

c. Else, remove last element.

So after eating the apple, the body becomes [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ] plus any previous segments? Wait no: initial body before this move was [ (4,7), (3,7) ].

After inserting old head (4,6) at front, it's [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Since we grew, we don't remove anything. So the new body is [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ].

So now S is:

Head: (4,5)

Body: [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Wait no, wait: when you eat the apple, the body doesn't just add one segment; it adds the old head and keeps all existing segments. So after eating, the body becomes longer.

But I'm a bit confused about how exactly the body grows. The key is that each time you don't eat an apple, the body shifts by removing the tail. When you do eat, the body grows by one segment (since you add the old head but don't remove anything).

So in this case:

After step 6, moving down to (4,5) and eating the apple, the body becomes [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Wait no: initial body before this move was [ (4,7), (3,7) ].

Inserting old head (4,6) at front makes it [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Since we ate the apple, we don't remove anything. So the new body is [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ].

So now S has:

Head: (4,5)

Body: [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

Wait no, wait: when you eat the apple, the head moves to (4,5). The body follows as per insertion and not removing. So the body segments are now three: (4,6), (4,7), (3,7).

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that after eating the apple at (4,5), the snake's body has grown by one segment.

Now, to continue moving, but in this problem, we're only concerned with reaching the apple. Once we've done so, the process is complete.

So the path would be:

1. RIGHT

2. RIGHT

3. RIGHT

4. RIGHT

5. DOWN

6. DOWN (to eat the apple)

But wait, moving from (4,7) to (4,6) is one down, then another down to (4,5). So total six moves: four rights and two downs.

Alternatively, could we have a shorter path? Let's see:

From initial position (0,7), can we move DOWN first?

Wait no, because the apple is at (4,5). Moving right towards x=4 is necessary. So moving down before reaching x=4 might not help.

But perhaps there's another way: Maybe after some rights and downs, but I think the shortest path is four rights and two downs, totaling six moves.

Wait no, wait: from (0,7) to (4,5):

The horizontal distance is 4 units right, vertical distance is 2 units down. So total Manhattan distance is 6. Since each move can only go one unit in a direction, the minimal number of moves is indeed 6.

So the path would be four rights and two downs in some order. But to avoid collision with the body, we have to ensure that when moving down after reaching (4,7), the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body.

Wait, but as I calculated earlier, when moving from (4,7) down to (4,6), the body parts are [ (3,7), (2,7) ] before the move. After inserting the old head (4,7), the body becomes [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ], but since we're moving down, the new head is (4,6). The body parts are at y=7 and y=6? Wait no:

Wait, when you move from (4,7) down to (4,6):

The body before this move was [ (3,7), (2,7) ].

After inserting old head (4,7) at front, the body becomes [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]

But since we're moving to (4,6), which is not part of the body after insertion. Wait no:

Wait, after this move, the body segments are [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ], and the new head is at (4,6). So none of these body parts are at y=6 except if any segment has y=6.

But in this case, all body segments are at y=7 or higher. Wait no: (4,6) is the new head; the body segments after insertion would be [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]—all at y=7 except maybe if any segment was moved down.

Wait no, when you move down from (4,7) to (4,6), the old positions were:

Head: (4,7)

Body: [ (3,7), (2,7) ]

After moving down, new head is (4,6). Inserting old head into body makes the body start at (4,7), then (3,7), then (2,7).

So no part of the body is at y=6 except the new head. So no collision occurs.

Similarly, when moving from (4,6) down to (4,5):

The body before this move was [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]? Wait no:

Wait, after the first down move:

Head: (4,6)

Body: [ (4,7), (3,7) ]

Because we inserted old head (4,7) and then since we didn't eat an apple yet (we ate it in the next move), wait no.

Wait no: when moving from (4,7) to (4,6):

- Insert old head (4,7) into body list [ (3,7), (2,7) ] → becomes [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]

But since we didn't eat the apple yet (we're only at (4,6)), so we remove last element: [ (4,7), (3,7) ]

Wait no, in this case, when moving to (4,6), that's not the apple. The apple is at (4,5). So after moving down from (4,7) to (4,6):

- Insert old head (4,7) into body list → [ (4,7), (3,7), (2,7) ]

- Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (4,7), (3,7) ]

So now S is:

Head: (4,6)

Body: [ (4,7), (3,7) ]

Then moving down from (4,6) to (4,5):

- Insert old head (4,6) into body list → [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

- Since new_head == apple, we don't remove anything. So body becomes [ (4,6), (4,7), (3,7) ]

So no collision occurs because the body parts after this move are at y=7 and y=6, but the head is at y=5, so no overlap.

Therefore, the path of four rights and two downs works without hitting the body.

Another possible path could be interleaving rights and downs, like R, D, R, D, R, R. But that might not necessarily be shorter; it's still six moves.

So the minimal number of moves is six: four to the right and two down.

But wait, perhaps there's a way to reach in fewer moves by taking different directions, but given the grid and the positions, I don't think so. The Manhattan distance is 4 + 2 = 6, which can't be less than that.

So the answer should be six moves.
</think>

The snake needs to move right four times and down two times to reach the apple at (4,5) from its starting position at (0,7). Each right move increases the x-coordinate by 1, and each down move decreases the y-coordinate by 1. This sequence ensures that the snake doesn't collide with its body and efficiently reaches the target in six moves.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (0,7), with its body following at (0,6) and (0,5). Wait no: initial body segments are two below the head? No, wait the problem states the initial position has a certain configuration, but from the earlier analysis, we determined that after each right move, the body shifts accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to outline the exact path:

- **Move 1**: RIGHT → (1,7)
- **Move 2**: RIGHT → (2,7)
- **Move 3**: RIGHT → (3,7)
- **Move 4**: RIGHT → (4,7)
- **Move 5**: DOWN → (4,6)
- **Move 6**: DOWN → (4,5) - eat the apple

Each move is in the cardinal direction as indicated. This sequence ensures that the snake's head moves from (0,7) to (4,5) without colliding with its body, successfully reaching and eating the apple in six moves.

**Answer:** The shortest path requires \boxed{6} moves.
