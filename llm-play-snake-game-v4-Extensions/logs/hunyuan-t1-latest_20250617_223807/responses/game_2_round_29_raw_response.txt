{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 8 times DOWN (from y=8 to y=0) and 3 times LEFT (from x=9 to x=6) to reach the apple at (6,0). The initial direction is DOWN, so continuing DOWN is safe as these cells (x=9, y=7 to 0) are not occupied by the body. After reaching (9,0), moving LEFT to (8,0), (7,0), and (6,0) avoids collisions since these cells are not in the body. This path ensures no self-collisions and reaches the apple safely."
