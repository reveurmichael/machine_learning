  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The shortest path to the apple (5,6) from (3,9) requires moving RIGHT twice (to reach x=5) and DOWN three times (to reach y=6). The initial direction is UP, so the first move RIGHT is allowed. Subsequent RIGHT moves follow to align with the x-coordinate goal, then DOWN moves achieve the y-coordinate. Each step avoids collisions with walls and the body."
