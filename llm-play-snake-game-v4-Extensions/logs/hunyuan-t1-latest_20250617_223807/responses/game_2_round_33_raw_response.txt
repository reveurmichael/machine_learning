========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right to align with the apple's x-coordinate (3) and then down to reach the apple's y-coordinate (1). Each move is checked for collisions with the body, which are avoided by moving in directions not occupied by the snake's current body segments. The path is safe as each new head position is within bounds and not colliding with the body, and after eating the apple, there are legal moves available."
