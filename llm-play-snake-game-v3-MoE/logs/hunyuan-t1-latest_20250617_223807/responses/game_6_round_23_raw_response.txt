========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 4 times (to reach x=9) and up 5 times (to reach y=9). Moving right first avoids collision with the snake's body, which is dense below and to the left of the head. After reaching (9,4), moving up avoids the tail and body segments, ensuring safe progression to the apple at (9,9)."
