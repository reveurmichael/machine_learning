{"moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "UP"], "reasoning": "We use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the shortest path from the start position (0,0) to the goal position (4,4) on a 5x5 grid with obstacles at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,3). This involves exploring all valid moves level by level. In this case, we find that the shortest path is UP, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP."}
