## Exercise sessions (Wednesday)

Most exercises will correspond to lecture topics, with some extensions (e.g. some more math).

Tests will take place during some Exercise sessions.

### Week 1

Starting from this session, we will use Jupyter Notebook

Please install Python, VS Code, and, ideally, you should be able to use Google Colab and GitHub.

Make sure you have a seamless Internet connection to those websites.

### Week 7

AWS 

### Week 8 - 10

TBD


## Project

Each group 3 students.

At most ONE group could have 2 or 4 students, provided that `N_Student % 3 != 0`.

Best projects will be hosted on `http://lunde.top`.

## Notes


###  Continuous assessment :

Tests will take place on Wednesdays (some of them).

In total, 4 tests will be conducted.

### Final score

Denoting your Continuous assessment score as `T`, your project score as `P`,
you final score will be 

```

```

## Asking questions :question:

#### Leveraging **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)** for asking questions
By default, you should ask questions via **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)**. Here is how:
- https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1364y1h7sb/

#### Principe
Here is the principle for asking questions:

>  **Google First, Peers Second, Profs Last.**

You are expected to ask questions via **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)**. However, as a **secondary**  (and hence, less desirable, less encouraged) choice, you could also ask questions in the WeChat group.

> Why Gitee Issue? Because it's simply more **professional**, and better in every sense.

In Gitee Issue and the WeChat group, questions will be answered selectively. 

Questions won't be answered if:
- they could be solved on a simple Google search
- they are out of the scope of the course
- they are well in advance of the progress of the course
- professors think that it's not interesting for discussion

#### Regarding personal WeChat chats:
- **Questions asked in personal WeChat chats will NOT be answered.**

Learning how to use Google & Baidu & Bing to solve computer science problems is an important skill you should develop during this course.

For private questions, please send your questions by email to:
- lundechen@shu.edu.cn (Lunde Chen)

#### Office visit

Office visit is NOT welcome unless you make an appointment at least one day in advance.
