========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right to increase x from 2 to 3 and up twice to increase y from 1 to 3. Starting with RIGHT avoids reversing direction (current direction is DOWN) and moves toward the apple's x-coordinate. Next, UP moves toward the apple's y-coordinate, and a second UP reaches the apple. These moves avoid collisions with the snake's body, which is primarily along x=2 and does not block (3,1), (3,2), or (3,3) initially. After eating the apple, moving RIGHT or UP remains safe, ensuring no immediate trapping."
