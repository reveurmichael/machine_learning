# No Over-Preparation

In the ROOT folder, excluding the "extensions" folder, WHAT SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED:

- Task-0 Focus: Only implements what Task-0 actually uses
- No Unused Code: No unimplemented functions prepared for future tasks
- Clean Base Classes: Base classes contain only what Task-0 needs
- Future Tasks: Will implement their own specific requirements, but reusing the same base classes and config as much as possible.
