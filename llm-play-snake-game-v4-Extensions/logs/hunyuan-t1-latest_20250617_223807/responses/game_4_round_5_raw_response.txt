========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (9,1) with a vertical body segment above it. To reach the apple at (3,4), the snake needs to move 6 LEFT (x decreases by 6) and 3 UP (y increases by 3). Moving LEFT first avoids reversing direction (current direction is DOWN) and safely navigates the head leftward, shifting the body to follow. After reaching (3,1), moving UP three times brings the head to (3,4) (the apple). Each move is checked for collisions with the grid bounds and body segments, ensuring safety. After eating the apple, the snake can continue moving UP, avoiding immediate trapping."
