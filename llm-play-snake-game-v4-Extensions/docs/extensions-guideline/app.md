# Streamlit App Pattern for Snake Game AI Extensions

> **Reference:** See `final-decision.md` (SUPREME_RULES), `scripts.md`, `standalone.md`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

All v0.03+ extensions must provide a `Streamlit app.py` as a **script launcher** (SUPREME_RULE NO.5). The app is not for real-time visualization, but for launching backend scripts with adjustable parameters.


## âœ… Key Points
- Only launch scripts, do not visualize game state.
- Use print_utils for all logging.
- No .log files, no complex logging.
