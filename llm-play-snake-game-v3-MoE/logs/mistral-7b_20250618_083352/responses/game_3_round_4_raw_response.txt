========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

 {
    "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT"],
    "reasoning": "The snake is currently at (4,3) and needs to reach the apple at (4,6). To avoid immediate self-collision and respect the direction rules, we first move 'DOWN' to position (4,2). Then, since the next horizontal move will be toward the apple, we can move 'RIGHT' to position (5,2). This path ensures safety, continuity of the body segments, and that there is at least one legal move after eating the apple."
