========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to help this user navigate their snake from (3,4) to (4,0). Let's break it down.

First, the head is at (3,4), and the apple is much lower at (4,0). The initial direction is UP, which would take the head up to (3,5). But wait, that might not be useful since the target is below. So maybe moving right makes more sense. 

Looking at the movement rules, I can't reverse directions immediately because it's the first move. Since we're starting from (3,4) facing UP, our next move can't be DOWN unless later in the game.

I need to calculate how many moves are needed horizontally and vertically. To go right from x=3 to x=4 is just 1 step. Vertically, moving down from y=4 to y=0 requires a drop of 4 steps (since it's Manhattan distance: 4-0=4). So I need to plan a path that covers these moves safely.

I should check for potential collisions. The snake's body right now is at (3,3) and (3,2), so moving up would bring the head into those positions if not careful. But maybe moving RIGHT first will help avoid immediate conflicts.

Wait, let's think about direction changes. If I start by moving RIGHT once, then I have to make sure each subsequent move doesn't cause a collision with any body segments or itself as it grows.

Also, after eating the apple, the snake needs to have at least one legal move left. So I should ensure that after reaching (4,0), there's still space for another move without getting stuck.

Another thing is ensuring that each step maintains the continuity of the snake's body and doesn't cause overlapping segments except when growing after eating an apple.

Hmm, starting with RIGHT seems safer because moving UP initially might lead straight into a collision. Let me try mapping out a few steps:

1. Move RIGHT to (4,4).
2. Then, check vertical moves down step by step: DOWN, then another DOWN, and so on until reaching (4,0).

But wait, each move needs to be checked for collisions with existing body segments. The initial body is at (3,3) and (3,2), but after moving RIGHT once, the head is now at (4,4). Then the next moves would involve shifting down while ensuring there's no collision.

I also need to make sure that when moving down each step, I don't land on any existing body segments. Since the initial body isn't in the downward path from (4,4), this should be safe for now.

After reaching (4,0), which is the apple location, the snake would have grown by one cell because it ate the apple, so the tail doesn't move that turn. Then, I need to ensure there's at least one more legal move possible without getting stuck.

Overall, moving RIGHT first seems like a good starting point to avoid immediate collisions and then proceed downward step by step.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves right once to start the journey towards the apple. Then, it proceeds downward four times to reach the apple safely without colliding with its body segments."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (3, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(3, 3), (3, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (4, 0). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
