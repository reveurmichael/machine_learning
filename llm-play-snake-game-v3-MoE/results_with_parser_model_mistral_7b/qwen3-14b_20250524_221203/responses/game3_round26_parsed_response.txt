{"moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (0, 8) and can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. To find the minimal number of steps to reach the apple at (1, 5), we calculate the Manhattan distance, which is |1-0| + |5-8| = 4. We choose a path that satisfies the minimal steps and avoids any potential issues with reversals or invalid moves: DOWN from (0, 8) to (0, 7), RIGHT from (0, 7) to (1, 7), DOWN from (1, 7) to (1, 6), and finally DOWN again from (1, 6) to (1, 5). This path successfully reaches the target position in exactly 4 moves."}
