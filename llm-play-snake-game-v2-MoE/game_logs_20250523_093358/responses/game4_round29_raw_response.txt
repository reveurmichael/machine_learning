========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll help you plan the snake's path to reach the apple safely. Let me analyze the current game state and generate the moves needed.

Here are the inputs:
- Head position: (8, 8)
- Current direction: UP
- Body cells: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7)]
- Apple position: (8, 4)

Let's evaluate the situation:

1. The snake is currently moving UP.
2. The apple is directly below the current head position at (8, 4).
3. Since we can't reverse direction immediately, we need to plan a path while avoiding collisions.

The simplest and safest path would be:
- Move RIGHT to (9, 8)
- Move DOWN to (9, 7)
- Move LEFT to (8, 7) - this avoids the body segment
- Then continue DOWN through (8, 6), (8, 5), and finally reach (8, 4)

Let's create the JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move RIGHT to avoid reversing direction immediately, then navigate around the body to safely reach the apple."
}
```

This path ensures we don't reverse direction on the first move and avoids colliding with the snake's body.
