BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (7,0) to the apple at (5,6). Let's start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (7,0), and it's currently moving DOWN. The body cells are [(7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)]. So, looking at this, the snake is long enough that I need to be careful about collisions with its own body.

First, I should visualize the grid. Since it's a 10x10 grid, coordinates go from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. The head is on the left side, near the bottom. The apple is up and to the left, at (5,6), which is quite a distance.

The movement rules say I can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is DOWN, my next move can't be UP. So from DOWN, possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or stay DOWN. But wait, if the current direction is DOWN and I choose another direction that's not opposite, it should be allowed.

Wait, no—the rules say you cannot reverse. So if current direction is "DOWN", I can't choose "UP" next move. But LEFT, RIGHT, or same direction (maybe?) are okay. Hmm, but in the movement update rule, choosing a new direction would change the head's position based on that direction.

So from (7,0) moving DOWN would take it to (7,-1), which is invalid because y= -1 is out of bounds. So that can't be an option. Wait, no—the current direction is DOWN, but if I don't choose a direction, the snake doesn't move? Or does the current direction affect what directions are allowed next.

Wait, according to the movement rules: you cannot reverse. So from "DOWN", you can't go "UP". But you can go LEFT, RIGHT, or same direction (but moving in same direction would mean the head continues in that path). Wait, but the movement is determined by the direction chosen each step.

So let's think about possible first moves:

Current direction: DOWN. So next move cannot be UP.

Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or maybe even DOWN again? Or does choosing the same direction count as a reverse?

Wait, in the rules, it says you can't reverse. Reversing would mean moving in the opposite direction. So from DOWN, you can choose any except UP. But if I choose to go DOWN again, is that allowed? Because that's not reversing; it's continuing in the same direction.

So possible first moves: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Wait, but moving DOWN from (7,0) would take head to (7,-1), which is out of bounds. So moving DOWN isn't an option because it leads to death. So the only options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Let me check what happens if I choose LEFT or RIGHT.

First, current position: Head at (7,0). Body cells behind are [(7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)]. So the body is extending downwards and to the right. The tail is at (8,2).

If I choose LEFT as the next move: new_head would be (6,0). Let's check for collisions.

The body cells are [(7,1), (8,1), ...]. So does (6,0) collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it moves?

Looking at the body cells: none of them are (6,0). Because the first body cell is (7,1), which is down and right from head. So moving LEFT to (6,0) seems safe.

If I choose RIGHT as next move: new_head would be (8,0). Let's check collisions. The body cells don't include (8,0); the first body cell is (7,1). So that's also safe.

Wait, but what about after moving? After moving, the body updates by adding the old head to the front of the body list and then removing the tail unless we eat an apple.

In this case, since we aren't eating the apple yet, the body length remains the same. So if I move LEFT or RIGHT, the new head is safe from collisions with current body segments.

So both LEFT and RIGHT are possible first moves. But which direction gets me closer to the apple?

The apple is at (5,6). The head is at (7,0). To reach (5,6), we need to move left 2 units and up 6 units.

So moving towards the west (LEFT) makes sense for the x-coordinate. But since moving LEFT first would take us closer in the x-direction, perhaps that's better.

But I also need to consider the path after that. Because as the snake moves, its body will block some paths if not managed properly.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT is a better idea because it allows more flexibility in future moves.

Wait, but moving LEFT from (7,0) would take us to (6,0). Then, perhaps moving UP several times towards the apple. Let's think about that path.

Another consideration: after moving, the body segments will shift. So I need to make sure that each subsequent move doesn't cause the head to collide with any part of the body, including where it might be in the next steps.

Let me try planning a possible path:

1. Move LEFT from (7,0) → (6,0). Body becomes [old_head (7,0), then existing body cells], and tail is removed if not eating apple.

2. Next move: UP to (6,1).

3. Then UP again to (6,2)... but wait, the current body after first move will be [(6,0)] followed by the previous body minus the tail? Or does the body include all segments except the head?

Wait, no—the movement update rule says:

After computing new_head and checking for collision, if safe, insert old head at front of BODY list (BODY becomes [old_head] + BODY), then remove the tail unless eating apple.

So in this case, after moving LEFT to (6,0), the body becomes [(7,0)] + [(7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)] → but wait, no. The BODY list is given as [(7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)], which are the body segments after the head.

So when moving LEFT:

- new_head = (6,0).

- Check collision: safe.

- Insert old head (7,0) at front of BODY → new BODY is [(7,0)] + [(7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)]. 

But wait, the movement rule says that in step 3a, insert old head into BODY list. So the full snake becomes [new_head] + [old_head, ... , tail].

Wait no—the S is [HEAD, BODY1, ..., BODYN]. After moving:

- new_head becomes HEAD.

- Then, the previous head (7,0) is added to the front of the BODY list.

So after first move, the body cells would be [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)].

But since we aren't eating an apple, we remove the tail. So the new body is [ (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2) ] because (8,2) is removed as the tail.

So now, the snake's head is at (6,0), and the body behind it is [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)].

Next move: I can choose UP since current direction was LEFT. So possible directions are any except RIGHT (since we just moved LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT? Wait no—current direction after first move is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT.

Wait, the movement rule says you cannot reverse. Reversing is choosing the opposite direction of your previous move.

So if I moved LEFT, my current direction is now LEFT. So the next move cannot be RIGHT.

Therefore, after moving LEFT once, the next possible moves are UP, DOWN, or same (LEFT again).

But moving LEFT again would take head to (5,0). Let's see:

After first move: head at (6,0), body [(7,0), ... ].

Second move: LEFT → (5,0). Check collision: does any part of the body include (5,0)? The body is [(7,0), (7,1), etc.], so no. So safe.

But perhaps moving UP is better to start heading towards the apple's y-coordinate.

Let me try that:

First move: LEFT → (6,0).

Second move: UP → (6,1). Check collision: body after first move includes (7,0) and others; (6,1) isn't in the body. Safe.

Body becomes [old_head (6,0)] + previous body, then remove tail unless eating apple.

So body after second move is [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1)]. Tail removed because we didn't eat apple.

This seems manageable. Continuing this way:

Third move: UP → (6,2). Check collision: body segments are [(6,0), (7,0), ... ] and so on; no collision at (6,2).

Fourth move: UP → (6,3).

Fifth move: UP → (6,4).

Sixth move: UP → (6,5).

Seventh move: UP → (6,6). Now, head is at (6,6), which is below the apple's y-coordinate of 6. So next, I can move RIGHT twice to get to x=7 and then x=8? Wait, but that's not efficient.

Wait, wait—the apple is at (5,6). From (6,6), moving LEFT would take me closer.

But wait, from (6,6), if I'm currently moving UP, my next possible directions are any except DOWN.

So after reaching (6,6), perhaps move LEFT to (5,6).

Wait, but let's check the steps:

After seventh move: head at (6,6). Body is [(5,0?), no—wait, each step adds the old head to the front and removes the tail. So it's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider another initial direction.

What if first move is RIGHT to (8,0), then start moving UP?

Let me try:

First move: RIGHT → (8,0). Check collision: body cells are [(7,1), ... ] so no collision. Safe.

Body becomes [old_head (7,0)] + previous body, then remove tail. So new body is [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)]. Tail removed because we didn't eat apple.

Second move: current direction is RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT.

If I choose UP: head moves to (8,1). Check collision: body includes (7,0) and others; no collision at (8,1).

But wait, the first body cell after moving right was (7,0), then (7,1), etc. So (8,1) is in the body now? Because after first move, the body is [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)]. Wait no—the initial body after moving right would be [ (7,0) ] + previous body minus tail.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Initial body before any move: [(7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)].

After first move to the right:

- new_head is (8,0).

- Insert old head (7,0) into body: so new body becomes [ (7,0) ] + previous body → [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)].

But since we aren't eating apple, remove the tail (8,2). So new body is [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)].

So after first move, head at (8,0), body segments are [ (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2) ].

Now, moving UP from (8,0):

- new_head is (8,1). Is (8,1) in the body? The body after first move includes (8,1). So collision occurs. Therefore, this move isn't allowed.

So if I choose to move RIGHT first, then trying to move UP into (8,1) would cause collision because that's part of the body. So that path is invalid.

Therefore, moving RIGHT as the first step might not be ideal because it blocks the upward movement.

Back to considering LEFT as the first move:

First move: LEFT → (6,0). Body becomes [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)] after removing tail.

Second move: UP → (6,1). Safe.

Third move: UP → (6,2).

Fourth move: UP → (6,3).

Fifth move: UP → (6,4).

Sixth move: UP → (6,5).

Seventh move: UP → (6,6).

Now, at (6,6), I need to get to (5,6). So next moves could be LEFT and then UP or something else. But wait, after moving UP seven times from (6,0), we'd have to manage the body.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to move diagonally, but since each move is only in one direction, I can't do that. So need to plan step by step.

But perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe there's a more straightforward path.

Another idea: after moving LEFT once to (6,0), then move UP multiple times while also moving further LEFT when needed.

Wait, but the body is behind, so I have to make sure that as I move upwards, the body doesn't block me.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to first move up a few steps and then left.

But considering the initial position, perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it directly reduces the x-coordinate towards 5.

So let's outline the path:

1. Move LEFT → (6,0). Body: [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)].

2. Move UP → (6,1). Body: [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1)].

3. Move UP → (6,2). Body: [(6,1), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (8,1)].

4. Move UP → (6,3). Body: [(6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1)].

5. Move UP → (6,4). Body: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (7,0)].

6. Move UP → (6,5). Body: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)].

7. Move UP → (6,6). Now at the same y as the apple but x=6 instead of 5.

Now, to get from (6,6) to (5,6), I need to move LEFT. But what's the body state?

After step 7: moving UP to (6,6). Body becomes [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)].

So when at (6,6), if I choose to move LEFT:

- new_head is (5,6).

- Check collision: does any body segment include (5,6)? The current body after step 7 is [(6,5), (6,4), ..., (6,1)]. So no, (5,6) is safe.

So eighth move: LEFT → (5,6). Success!

But wait, are there more steps needed? Because I have to continue moving from there. But the apple is at (5,6), so once the head reaches that position, it's collected.

Wait, but in this case, we just moved to (5,6) on the eighth move. So the path would be:

1. LEFT

2. UP

3. UP

4. UP

5. UP

6. UP

7. UP

8. LEFT

That's eight moves total.

But I need to make sure that each of these steps doesn't cause a collision with the body at any point.

Let me verify step by step:

Step 1: Head (6,0). Body after move: [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)] → no collision.

Step 2: Move UP to (6,1). Body becomes [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1)]. No collision at (6,1).

Step 3: Move UP to (6,2). Body becomes [(6,1), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (8,1)]. No collision.

Step 4: Move UP to (6,3). Body becomes [(6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1)]. Safe.

Step 5: Move UP to (6,4). Body becomes [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (7,0)]. Safe.

Step 6: Move UP to (6,5). Body becomes [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]. Safe.

Step 7: Move UP to (6,6). Body becomes [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]. Safe.

Step 8: Move LEFT to (5,6). Body before move is [(6,5), ... ] → no collision at (5,6).

So this path seems valid. Therefore, the sequence of moves would be:

1. LEFT

2. UP

3. UP

4. UP

5. UP

6. UP

7. UP

8. LEFT

Alternatively, could we have done it in fewer steps? Probably not, since moving from x=6 to x=5 requires at least one step, and y needs to increase by 6.

Wait, initially at (7,0), so to get to (5,6), the head has to move left twice (from 7→6→5) and up six times. So that's a total of eight moves, which is what we have here.

Therefore, the optimal path is:

LEFT, then UP six times, then LEFT again? Wait no—because after moving up six times from (6,0), you reach (6,6), then move left once to (5,6).

Wait, in my earlier steps, it's eight moves: one left, six ups, and another left. But that would be eight moves. Alternatively, is there a way to interleave the lefts and ups?

But considering the body movement, each left or up affects the position and the body segments.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT once, then UP six times, and then LEFT again as I did.

Another consideration: after step 8, when head reaches (5,6), is there any body segment that could block further moves? But since we've reached the apple, maybe that's sufficient.

So in conclusion, the sequence would be:

1. LEFT

2. UP

3. UP

4. UP

5. UP

6. UP

7. UP

8. LEFT

Therefore, the final answer is a series of moves: first a LEFT, then six UPS, and finally another LEFT.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting position (7,0) to the target position (5,6) while avoiding collisions with our own body segments. Each move can only be in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.

### Approach
1. **Initial Analysis**: The goal is to reach (5,6) from (7,0). We need to decrease the x-coordinate by 2 and increase the y-coordinate by 6.
2. **Path Planning**: Since we can only move one step at a time in any of the four directions, we'll plan our moves to first reduce the x-coordinate and then increase the y-coordinate, ensuring we don't collide with our body segments.
3. **Avoiding Collisions**: Each move adds the previous head position to the body segments. We need to ensure that each new head position doesn't coincide with any part of the body.

### Solution Code
```python
# The sequence of moves needed is as follows:
# LEFT, then six times UP, then LEFT again.
moves = ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT"]
```

### Explanation
1. **First Move**: Start by moving LEFT to (6,0). This reduces the x-coordinate from 7 to 6, which is one step closer to the target.
2. **Next Moves**: From (6,0), move UP six times to reach (6,6). Each move up increases the y-coordinate without affecting the x-coordinate.
3. **Final Move**: After reaching (6,6), make a final LEFT move to (5,6), which is the target position.

This approach ensures that we efficiently reach the target by strategically moving left and then up multiple times, avoiding any collisions with our body segments throughout the journey.

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 0) and whose body cells are in list format [(7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 6). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
