========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the snake from (2,2) to eat the apple at (1,7). Let's see what the current state is.

The head is at (2,2), and it's moving LEFT. The body is behind it at [(3,2), (4,2)]. So the snake is extending to the right because each body segment is one step left of the next. Wait, no—the body list starts from the segment immediately behind the head. So after the head, the first body is at (3,2), then (4,2). That means the snake is moving LEFT, so it's going west.

The apple is at (1,7), which is to the north and west of the head. But since the head can't reverse direction immediately—if it's currently moving LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. Wait, no—current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT? Or wait, the movement rules say you cannot choose the opposite direction as current. So if current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT.

So from (2,2), current direction is LEFT, which means it's moving west. The apple is at (1,7). That's one step left and five steps up. But since I'm currently moving LEFT, my first move can't be RIGHT. So the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

But wait, no—the movement rules say you cannot reverse direction on the first move if current direction is NONE. Wait, in this case, the current direction isn't NONE—it's LEFT. So for any next move, I can choose any direction except RIGHT, because that would be reversing.

Wait, no: rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current direction is LEFT, next cannot be RIGHT. But other directions are allowed, including UP and DOWN.

So the first move can't be RIGHT. It could be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But I need to get to (1,7), which requires moving left once (from 2 to 1 in x-coordinate) and up five times (from 2 to 7 in y). So a total of one LEFT and five UP moves. But the path needs to be planned considering the body movement and avoiding collisions.

Let's think about the current snake: head at (2,2), then body at (3,2) and (4,2). So if I move LEFT next, new_head would be (1,2). Then check for collisions. The body is [(3,2), (4,2)]. So after moving LEFT, inserting old head (2,2) to the front of the body, so the body becomes [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2)], then remove the tail unless we eat an apple.

But in this case, new_head is (1,2), which is not the apple position (which is (1,7)). So after moving LEFT, the snake's head would be at (1,2), and body would be [(2,2), (3,2)], because tail is removed. Wait no—since we're not eating an apple, the tail is removed. So after inserting old head into body list, it becomes [BODY1=(2,2), BODY2=(3,2)]. Then remove last element (BODY2) if not growing. So body would be [(2,2)].

Wait, initial body is [(3,2), (4,2)]. After moving LEFT to (1,2), the new head is (1,2). The old head (2,2) becomes BODY1. Then we check: since new_head != apple, we remove tail (BODYN = 4,2). So body after move would be [BODY1=(3,2)]. Wait no—wait, initial body is [(3,2), (4,2)], which are the segments behind the head.

When moving LEFT:

new_head = (2-1, 2) = (1,2).

Check collision: new_head must not coincide with any BODYi except when it's the tail that will move this turn. So current body is [(3,2), (4,2)]. The new_head (1,2) isn't in the body, so no collision.

Then update body:

a. Insert old head (2,2) at front → body becomes [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ].
b. Since not eating apple, remove tail → new body is [ (2,2), (3,2) ].
c. Set HEAD to (1,2).

So the snake's new state is head at (1,2), body at [(2,2), (3,2)].

Next move: from (1,2). The current direction was LEFT, but we moved in that direction again—so what is the next direction? Wait, after moving LEFT once, the new direction becomes LEFT because the movement was in that direction. So for the next move, we can't choose RIGHT.

But I need to get up to (1,7). From (1,2), I need to move UP five times. But each time I move UP, I have to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

Let me try planning the moves step by step.

Current state after first move:

Head: (1,2)
Body: [(2,2), (3,2)]
Direction: LEFT

Next move options: UP, DOWN, or LEFT again. But moving LEFT further would take us to (0,2). Let's see if that's necessary.

But since the apple is at (1,7), which is directly above the head in y-coordinate but one step left in x, perhaps we can plan a path that moves up as much as possible without getting blocked by the body.

Wait, the apple is at (1,7). So from (2,2) to (1,7): need to move LEFT once and UP five times. But considering the movement constraints.

Alternatively, maybe moving in some other direction first could allow a safer path.

But let's try the direct approach.

First move: LEFT → (1,2).

Second move: UP → (1,3). Check collision: new_head is (1,3), body is [(2,2), (3,2)]. Not colliding. So update body:

Insert old head (1,2) into front of body → [ (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) ].

Since not eating apple, remove tail → new body is [ (1,2), (2,2) ].

Head now at (1,3). Direction: UP.

Third move: UP → (1,4). Check collision: body is [(1,2), (2,2)]. No collision. Update body:

Insert old head (1,3) into front → [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ].

Remove tail → new body is [ (1,3), (1,2) ].

Head at (1,4). Direction: UP.

Fourth move: UP → (1,5). Check collision: body [(1,3), (1,2)]. No collision. Body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)].

Fifth move: UP → (1,6). Body is [(1,5), (1,4)].

Sixth move: UP → (1,7) which is the apple's position. Now check:

new_head = (1,7).

Is this colliding with any body segments? Current body before moving is [(1,5), (1,4)]. So new_head (1,7) is not in the body, so no collision.

Then, since new_head == apple position, we need to grow. So insert old head (1,6) into front of body → [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] and do not remove tail. So body becomes [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].

So now the snake is longer by one segment. The new state:

Head: (1,7)
Body: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]

But after eating the apple, we need to ensure that there's at least one legal move next turn to avoid being trapped. So let's check if from (1,7) in which direction can we go.

Current direction is UP, but after moving UP again, the new direction would be UP, so next moves cannot be DOWN unless the current direction changes.

Wait, no: after moving UP six times, our last move was to UP. So for the seventh move, if any, the next move's direction cannot be DOWN because we're currently going UP.

But in this case, after eating the apple, do we need to plan further moves? The problem requires that after eating, there's at least one legal move next turn. But since we've reached the apple, perhaps it's sufficient as per the movement rules.

Wait, but the problem says "after eating, ensure there is at least one legal move on the next turn to avoid immediate trapping." So from (1,7), after eating the apple, we need to have at least one direction available.

Current body is [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. The head is at (1,7). Possible moves:

- LEFT: (0,7) → check if it's within bounds. Yes.
- RIGHT: (2,7) → but new_head would be (2,7). But the body is [(1,6), ...], so no collision except possibly with tail.

Wait, let's see:

If we choose to move RIGHT next, new_head = (2,7).

Check collision: Does this collide with any BODYi? Current body after eating apple is [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]. So new_head (2,7) is not in the body. The tail would be at (1,4). So no collision.

Alternatively, moving LEFT to (0,7): which is also okay.

But we have to make sure that moving from (1,7) doesn't cause any issues.

Wait, but let's see: when you move from (1,7), the body segments would be updated as follows:

Insert old head into front of body, then remove tail only if not growing. But since this is a new move after eating apple, we have to think about what happens when moving again.

But perhaps for our problem, since we've already reached the apple in six moves, and each step was verified to be non-colliding except the first one where we moved LEFT, which was safe.

Wait, but the initial plan is:

Move 1: LEFT → (1,2)
Move 2: UP → (1,3)
Move 3: UP → (1,4)
Move 4: UP → (1,5)
Move 5: UP → (1,6)
Move 6: UP → (1,7) [apple]

Each move needs to be checked for collision.

Wait, but after each move except the first, is there a possibility of collision with body segments?

Let's retrace:

After Move 1: Head at (1,2), body [(2,2), (3,2)] → no collision when moving UP next.

Move 2: Up to (1,3). Body after insert and remove tail becomes [ (1,2), (2,2) ].

Move 3: Up to (1,4). Body becomes [ (1,3), (1,2) ].

Wait, no—each time we move, the body is updated by inserting old head into front and then removing the last element unless we eat apple.

So after Move 1: new_head (1,2), body [(2,2), (3,2)] becomes [(2,2), (3,2)] after insert and remove tail.

Wait no—inserting old head (2,2) into front of current body list [(3,2), (4,2)], so the new body before removing tail is [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ]. Then since we're not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (2,2), (3,2) ].

Wait no: initial body after Move 1:

new_head = (1,2)

body before update is [(3,2), (4,2)].

Insert old head into front: so new body list becomes [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ] → this seems incorrect because the body segments should follow the path of movement. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body updates.

When you move, the old head is added to the front of the body list, and then the last segment is removed unless you grow.

So from initial state:

Head: (2,2)
Body: [(3,2), (4,2)]

After moving LEFT to (1,2):

new_head = (1,2)

body becomes [ (2,2) ] + current body → [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ]

Then remove last segment because not growing: body is [ (2,2), (3,2) ]

So after Move 1:

Head: (1,2)
Body: [(2,2), (3,2)]

Move 2: UP to (1,3)

new_head = (1,3)

body becomes [ (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) ] → then remove last segment: [ (1,2), (2,2) ]

So body is [(1,2), (2,2)]

Move 3: UP to (1,4)

new_head = (1,4)

body becomes [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ] → remove last segment → [ (1,3), (1,2) ]

So body is [(1,3), (1,2)]

Move 4: UP to (1,5)

new_head = (1,5)

body becomes [ (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] → remove last segment → [ (1,4), (1,3) ]

So body is [(1,4), (1,3)]

Move 5: UP to (1,6)

new_head = (1,6)

body becomes [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] → remove last segment → [ (1,5), (1,4) ]

So body is [(1,5), (1,4)]

Move 6: UP to (1,7) which is apple.

Check collision: new_head is (1,7). Body before update is [(1,5), (1,4)]. So no collision.

Then, since eating apple, insert old head into front and don't remove tail:

new body becomes [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]

So after this move:

Head: (1,7)
Body: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]

Now, check if from here, there's at least one legal move.

Possible directions:

- LEFT to (0,7): no collision because body is [ (1,6), ... ] which doesn't include (0,7).
- RIGHT to (2,7): same logic.
- DOWN to (1,6): but that would be moving into the first body segment. So new_head = (1,6) which is in body → collision.

So moving DOWN from (1,7) is invalid because it collides with body[0].

Moving LEFT or RIGHT is okay.

Therefore, after eating the apple, there are at least two possible moves: LEFT and RIGHT. So condition is satisfied.

Thus, the sequence of six moves would successfully reach the apple without collision and have a valid next move.

But wait—let's check each step for potential collisions beyond what was already done.

Wait in Move 2:

After moving UP to (1,3), body becomes [ (1,2), (2,2) ].

Is there any possibility that when we move UP again to (1,4), the new_head (1,4) is not colliding with current body before update?

Yes, because before inserting old head, the body was [(1,2), (2,2)]. So moving UP to (1,3) is okay.

Similarly for other steps.

So overall, this plan seems valid.

But wait—the initial move from (2,2) to LEFT (1,2): could that be a problem? Because the body after moving would have segments at (2,2), (3,2). So when we inserted old head into front, it was (2,2) inserted before (3,2), making [(2,2), (3,2)]. Then remove tail → [(2,2)].

But actually, no—after inserting the old head (2,2), the body becomes [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ] → then removing last segment gives [ (2,2), (3,2) ].

So it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps another path would be better. For example, moving UP first, but since current direction is LEFT and next move can't be RIGHT, maybe moving UP is the way to go.

Wait no—the first move must be either LEFT again, or UP or DOWN. Since apple is up and left, perhaps it's better to get into position where you can go up as much as possible.

But in any case, my initial plan seems valid.

Another thing: when we reach (1,7), the body is [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. So from (1,7), moving LEFT would take us to (0,7). Let's see if that's possible without collision:

After Move 6, head is at (1,7). To move LEFT next:

new_head = (0,7).

Body before moving: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ].

Insert old head into front → [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]

Since not growing, remove last segment → [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ].

Wait no—when moving from (1,7), the body is [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. After inserting old head into front, it becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]. Then remove last segment because not eating apple anymore. So new body is [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ].

Wait but when moving from (1,7), the old head is (1,7). Inserting into front of current body [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ], we get [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]. Then remove last segment → [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ].

So no collision when moving LEFT because new_head is (0,7), which isn't in the body before the move. So it's safe.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT from (1,7):

new_head = (2,7)

Body after insert and remove → [ (1,6), (1,5) ].

No collision as well.

Thus, the plan works.

Therefore, the minimal number of steps is six.
</think>

The minimum number of moves required for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its body is 6.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:**
   - Snake's head at (2,2).
   - Body segments at (3,2) and (4,2).

2. **Move 1: LEFT**
   - New head position: (1,2).
   - Update body: Insert (2,2) at front → [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. Remove last segment → [(2,2), (3,2)].
   - Body now: (2,2), (3,2).

3. **Move 2: UP**
   - New head position: (1,3).
   - Update body: Insert (1,2) at front → [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)]. Remove last segment → [(1,2), (2,2)].
   - Body now: (1,2), (2,2).

4. **Move 3: UP**
   - New head position: (1,4).
   - Update body: Insert (1,3) at front → [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]. Remove last segment → [(1,3), (1,2)].
   - Body now: (1,3), (1,2).

5. **Move 4: UP**
   - New head position: (1,5).
   - Update body: Insert (1,4) at front → [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. Remove last segment → [(1,4), (1,3)].
   - Body now: (1,4), (1,3).

6. **Move 5: UP**
   - New head position: (1,6).
   - Update body: Insert (1,5) at front → [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]. Remove last segment → [(1,5), (1,4)].
   - Body now: (1,5), (1,4).

7. **Move 6: UP**
   - New head position: (1,7) [reaches the apple].
   - Update body by inserting (1,6) at front → [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].
   - Since eating the apple, do not remove the last segment.

After these moves, the snake successfully reaches the apple without colliding with its body. Each step ensures that the new head position does not overlap with existing body segments before updating them.

**Answer:**
The minimum number of moves required is \boxed{6}.
