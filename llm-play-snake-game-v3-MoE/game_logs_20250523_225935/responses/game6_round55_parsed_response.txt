{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "RIGHT"], "reasoning": "The snake starts by moving up to reach a point that's one step above and two steps to the right of its current position (5, 9). Then it moves diagonally down-right to avoid colliding with its body. After reaching (6, 8), it turns around and heads back up to (7, 8) where it can move directly down to reach the apple at (7, 4). This takes a total of 7 moves."}
