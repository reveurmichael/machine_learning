========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (1,1) with a vertical body along x=1. To reach the apple at (3,5), the snake needs to move right 2 and up 4. Moving RIGHT first avoids reversing direction and safely navigates away from the body. Subsequent UP moves climb the y-axis, staying clear of the body segments. Finally, a RIGHT move reaches the apple. Each move is valid, avoids collisions, and ensures the snake doesn't trap itself."
