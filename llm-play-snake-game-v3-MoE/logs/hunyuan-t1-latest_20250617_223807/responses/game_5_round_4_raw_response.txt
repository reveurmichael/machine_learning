========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 6 times to reach the apple at (7,0) from (1,0). Each right move is safe as the body segments are initially above the head and shift leftward with each move, avoiding collisions. After reaching the apple, the snake can continue moving right (next head at (8,0)) without immediate collision, ensuring a valid path."
