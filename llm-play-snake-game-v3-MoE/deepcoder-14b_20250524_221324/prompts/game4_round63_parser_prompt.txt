<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (8,6) to eat the apple at (0,6). The current direction is LEFT, and the body cells are [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)]. 

First, I'll visualize the grid. The snake's head is at (8,6). Since the direction is LEFT, the next move would normally be to (7,6), but wait, no—the current direction is LEFT, so if it continues moving LEFT, that's possible unless blocked by its body.

Looking at the body cells: starting from behind the head, which is (9,6) because the body list starts with the segment immediately behind. Wait, no—wait, the body list given is [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)]. So the head is at (8,6). The first body cell is (9,6), which is to the right of the head. That makes sense if the snake was moving LEFT before, but wait—the current direction is LEFT, so that would mean the head is moving left, and the body follows.

Wait, no: the body list starts with the segment immediately behind the head. So after the head (8,6), the next cell is (9,6). That suggests that the snake was previously moving to the right (since the cell to the right is the next one). But the current direction is LEFT, which means the snake's movement just before this step was to the left.

Wait no: when the direction is LEFT, each move subtracts 1 from the x-coordinate. So if the head is at (8,6), and the body cell behind it is (9,6), that implies that in the previous step, the snake moved LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6). But wait, that doesn't make sense because moving LEFT would mean x decreases by 1. So if the head was at (9,6) and moved LEFT, it would go to (8,6), which is correct.

Wait no: the body list starts with the segment behind the head. So after the head, the next cell is (9,6). That means that in the previous step, the snake's head was at (9,6), and then moved LEFT to (8,6). So the current direction is LEFT, which makes sense.

Now, I need to plan a path from (8,6) to (0,6), moving LEFT as much as possible since that's the current direction. But wait, can the snake just keep moving LEFT? Let me check if that's possible without colliding with its body.

Looking at the body cells: after (9,6), we have (9,7), then (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8). So from (8,6), moving LEFT would take it to (7,6). But wait, is there a body cell at (7,6)? The body list doesn't include any cells below y=8 except the initial ones. Wait, no—looking at the body list: all the cells after (9,6) are in higher y's or same x but higher y.

Wait, so from (8,6), moving LEFT to (7,6): is that cell occupied by any part of the body? The body cells include (5,8), (6,8), etc. So no, (7,6) isn't in the body list. Wait, but wait: when you move, the body shifts. After each move, the body moves as well.

Wait, let me think about this step by step. The snake's current head is at (8,6). The body cells are [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)]. So the tail is at (5,8).

If the snake moves LEFT from (8,6) to (7,6):

1. Check collision: new_head is (7,6). Are any body cells except potentially the tail's current position conflicting? The body cells are:

BODY1: (9,6)
BODY2: (9,7)
BODY3: (9,8)
BODY4: (8,8)
BODY5: (7,8)
BODY6: (6,8)
BODY7: (5,8)

So new_head (7,6) is not in any of these. So no collision.

Then, update the body:

a. Insert old head (8,6) at front of BODY → new BODY becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)].

b. Since the apple is not at (7,6), we don't grow; instead, remove the tail (5,8). So new BODY after removal would be [(8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)].

Wait no: when moving normally, you insert the old head at front and remove the tail. Wait, wait—the movement update rule says:

After inserting the old head, if not eating apple, remove the last element (tail). So after insertion, the body becomes [old_head] + current_body. Then, if not eating, remove the last element.

Wait no: step 3a is to insert the old head at front of BODY list (so it becomes BODY1), and then in step 3c, if not growing, remove the last element (the tail). So after inserting, the body is [old_head] + current_body. Then, if not eating apple, remove the last element.

Wait no: initial state:

BODY list before move is [(9,6), (9,7), ..., (5,8)]. When you insert old head (8,6) at front, it becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,7), ... , (5,8)].

Then, if not eating apple, remove the last element: so new body is [(8,6), (9,6), (9,7), ..., (6,8)]. The tail is now at (6,8).

Wait no: initial body list is length 7. After inserting old head, it's length 8. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element (tail) → new body is length 7 again.

So after this move, the new head is (7,6), and the body cells are [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)]. Wait no: wait, when you insert old head at front, it's [old_head] + current_body. Then remove last element if not growing.

Wait the initial body list is [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)].

After inserting old head (8,6) at front → new temporary body is [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8) ].

Then, if not eating apple, remove last element (5,8). So the new body list becomes [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ].

Wait that's 7 elements. But wait, initial body had 7 elements; after inserting head and removing tail, it remains at 7.

But in the movement example given, when they moved LEFT and didn't eat apple, the body became [(4,4)]? Wait no: the example was S = [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)], then new_head is (3,4). Then insert old head → BODY becomes [(4,4), (4,3)]. Then remove tail (assuming not eating apple) → BODY becomes [(4,4)].

Wait that's a different scenario. So in general, each move (if not growing) the body length remains same as before, except when you eat, it grows by one.

So back to our case: after moving LEFT from (8,6) to (7,6), and since we didn't eat apple, the body is now [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ].

Wait no: wait, no—the head was at (8,6). The new head is (7,6). The old head (8,6) becomes the first body cell. Then the rest of the body shifts.

So after inserting old head, the body would be [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), ... , (5,8) ] → that's 8 elements. But since we're not growing, remove last element: new body is [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), ..., (6,8) ].

Wait I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to track the snake after each move step by step.

Current state:

HEAD: (8,6)
BODY: [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)]
APPLE: at (0,6) presumably.

First move: LEFT to (7,6).

Check collision: new_head (7,6) not in body → ok.

Insert old head into body front: so new temporary body is [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8) ].

Since we didn't eat apple, remove last element (5,8). So new body becomes:

[ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ]

So the new head is (7,6), and the body follows as above.

Now, next move: continue moving LEFT to (6,6). Let's check collision: new_head (6,6).

Is (6,6) in the current body? The body after first move is [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ].

So no, (6,6) isn't in the body. So we can proceed.

Insert old head (7,6) into front of body → temporary body becomes [ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), ..., (6,8) ]. Then remove last element (6,8). New body is:

[ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8) ]

Wait no: wait after first move, the body was [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ].

When moving again LEFT to (6,6):

Insert old head (7,6) at front: [ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ]

Then remove last element if not eating apple → new body is:

[ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8) ]

So the body now has 7 elements again.

Continue this way: next move to (5,6). Check collision: new_head (5,6) not in body.

Insert old head (6,6) → temporary body becomes [ (6,6), (7,6), ..., (7,8) ] and so on. Remove last element each time.

But wait, I'm trying to see if the snake can keep moving left all the way to (0,6). The problem is that as it moves left, its body will extend in a certain pattern. But also, we have to make sure that when it turns or changes direction, it doesn't collide with itself.

Wait no—the current path is just straight left along y=6. Let's see:

After each move, the head moves left by one, and the body follows. The initial body was at higher y's (7,8), etc., so as the snake moves down to y=6, it might not interfere with its own body.

Wait no—the body cells are currently in higher y's except for (9,6) which is directly to the right of the head.

Wait but after moving left once, the body now includes (8,6). So if we move again left to (7,6), then the body will include (8,6) and (9,6).

But wait, in the next moves, as the snake continues left, the body cells below y=8 are not yet overlapping.

Wait but let me think: when moving from (8,6) → (7,6), the body now includes (8,6). Then moving to (6,6): body includes (7,6), (8,6), etc. So as long as we don't have any of these new head positions overlapping with existing body cells except possibly the tail.

Wait no—since each time we insert the old head into the front and remove the last element if not growing, the body is a contiguous chain behind the head.

So moving straight left along y=6 should be possible without collision as long as none of those new x positions (like 7,6; 6,6) are already in the body.

Wait but after first move: body includes (8,6), which was previously the head. Then next moves would have bodies that don't include any of the new positions except for the segments behind.

Wait I'm getting a bit tangled here, perhaps it's better to try drawing this out or simulate step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more efficient way to reach (0,6). Since moving straight left is possible, but maybe after a few steps, the snake can turn up or down to avoid any potential collisions if they arise.

Wait another thought: the apple is at (0,6), so the snake needs to get all the way to x=0 on y=6. The current head is at (8,6). So moving left 8 times would bring it there, but we have to ensure that each step doesn't cause collision.

But wait, let me check: after each move, is the new head position safe?

First move: (7,6) → safe.
Second move: (6,6) → safe.
Third move: (5,6). Is (5,6) in body? Current body after two moves would be:

After first move:
BODY: [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ]

Wait no—after moving to (7,6), the body is [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), ..., (6,8) ].

After second move to (6,6):

Insert old head (7,6) → temporary body: [ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ]

Remove last element (6,8): new body is [ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8) ].

So (5,6) isn't in this body yet. So moving to (5,6) next would be safe.

Continuing:

Third move: (5,6). Insert old head (6,6) → temporary body: [ (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), ..., (7,8) ].

Remove last element: new body is [ (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8) ] → wait no, initial body after second move was 7 elements. After inserting and removing, it should remain at 7.

Wait I'm getting confused again. Let me recount:

After first move: head is (7,6). Body is [ (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ].

Second move to (6,6): insert old head (7,6) → temporary body: [ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8) ]. Then remove last element (6,8). So new body is [ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8) ].

Third move to (5,6): insert old head (6,6) → temporary body: [ (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8) ]. Remove last element (7,8). New body is [ (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8) ].

So new head at (5,6): check if any body cells are here. The body is now:

(6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8).

No, (5,6) isn't in the body.

Continuing this way, each move left would be safe as long as we don't have any overlapping. But I'm concerned that at some point, the body might loop around and block itself.

Wait, but since the snake is moving straight left along y=6, and its body is extending behind it, which is also on y=6 or higher y's. Wait no—the initial body cells after the head are:

After first move: (8,6), (9,6) → wait no, initial body was [(9,6), ...], but after moving left, the body starts with (8,6).

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the snake can just keep moving straight left without any issues.

But let's see: how many moves would it take to get from x=8 to x=0 on y=6? That's 8 steps (from 8→7→6...→0). So eight LEFT moves.

Each time, we need to ensure that the new head position isn't in the current body.

But let me check for each step:

1. Move left to (7,6): safe.
2. Move left to (6,6): safe.
3. Move left to (5,6): safe.
4. Move left to (4,6): safe.
5. Move left to (3,6): safe.
6. Move left to (2,6): safe.
7. Move left to (1,6): safe.
8. Move left to (0,6): eat apple! Game over? Wait no—wait the goal is to reach the apple, so perhaps it's just to get there without dying.

Wait but in this case, since we're moving straight towards the apple at (0,6), and each step is safe, then the path would be possible with eight LEFT moves.

But wait another thought: when the snake reaches (1,6) and moves left to (0,6), its body will have extended all the way back. So after that move, the body would include all cells from (1,6) down to wherever, but as long as the new head (0,6) isn't in the body before moving.

Wait no—the body is always behind the head, so when the head moves into a new cell, it's not part of the body yet. So unless the next cell is already part of the body (which would be impossible if we're moving straight and the body is trailing), we should be safe.

Therefore, the shortest path is to move LEFT eight times in a row, each time without any collision.

So the answer would be:

LEFT
LEFT
LEFT
LEFT
LEFT
LEFT
LEFT
LEFT

Or, more concisely, eight LEFT moves.
</think>

The snake can navigate from its starting position at (8,6) straight left along y=6 to reach the apple at (0,6). Each move is safe as it doesn't collide with any part of its body. The sequence involves moving left eight times.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** Snake's head is at (8,6), body follows behind.
2. **First Move LEFT:** Head moves to (7,6). No collision as this cell was empty except for the old head which is no longer part of the body after movement.
3. **Second Move LEFT:** Head at (6,6). Safe, no overlap with current body cells.
4. **Continue Moving LEFT:** Each subsequent move (to 5,6; 4,6; etc.) continues to be safe as the snake's body follows without blocking its path.
5. **Final Move LEFT:** After eight moves, the head reaches (0,6), successfully collecting the apple.

**Answer:**

The snake should move LEFT eight times in a row:

LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT
```

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
