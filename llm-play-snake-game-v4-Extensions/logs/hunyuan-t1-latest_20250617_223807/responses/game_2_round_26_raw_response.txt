========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": [],
"reasoning": "The snake's body forms a dense barrier blocking all potential paths to the apple. The body occupies x=0-4 (vertical) and x=2-3, y=9 (horizontal), leaving no safe route to navigate around or through the body segments to reach the apple at (9,8). Immediate movement in any direction either collides with the body or leads to entrapment."
