========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 3 steps (from x=8 to x=5) and down 3 steps (from y=6 to y=3) to reach the apple. Starting with DOWN avoids reversing the initial RIGHT direction. Each DOWN move (to (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)) is safe as these positions are not occupied by the body. Then, moving LEFT (to (7,3), (6,3), (5,3)) avoids body collisions, reaching the apple. After eating, there are valid next moves (e.g., UP, DOWN, LEFT) ensuring survival."
