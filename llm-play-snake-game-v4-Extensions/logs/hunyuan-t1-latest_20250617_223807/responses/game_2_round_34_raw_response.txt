========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 3 times and down 1 time to reach the apple at (0,0). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing the current DOWN direction. Each LEFT move checks for safety (no body collisions), and the final DOWN reaches the apple. After eating, moving RIGHT to (1,0) is safe, ensuring no immediate trapping."
