You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
To plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple at (7, 7) from its current position (9, 1), let's analyze the situation and consider the movement rules.

First, we need to determine how many moves are necessary in each direction:
- The horizontal difference between (9, 1) and (7, 7): 9 - 7 = 2
- The vertical difference between (9, 1) and (7, 7): 7 - 1 = 6

We need to move 2 positions LEFT and 6 positions UP.

Let's consider the current direction which is DOWN. To reach the apple, we must first stop going down (by changing direction), then move left and up.

Here's a potential sequence of moves:
1. Change from DOWN to LEFT (since we can't reverse directly)
2. Move 2 times LEFT
3. Change to UP
4. Move 6 times UP

Now let's check if this path avoids collisions with the snake's body and ensures there are no traps.

Given the snake's current position at (9, 1) and its body at [(9, 3), (9, 2)], we can see that moving LEFT twice will take us to (7, 1). Then, moving UP six times from (7, 1) to (7, 7) should be collision-free.

Let's construct the JSON output with this reasoning:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "First move LEFT twice to reach (7, 1), then UP six times to reach the apple at (7, 7). This path avoids collisions with the body and ensures there are no traps."
}
```

This JSON object meets all constraints and safely guides the snake to eat the apple.
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (9, 1) and whose body cells are in list format [(9, 3), (9, 2)], to eat the apple at (7, 7).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
