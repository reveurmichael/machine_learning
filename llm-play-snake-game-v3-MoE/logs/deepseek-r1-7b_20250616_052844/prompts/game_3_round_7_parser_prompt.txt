<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out a path for the snake from (7,4) to (5,9). The current direction is DOWN. So, initially, the head can move either UP or RIGHT because moving DOWN would take it off the grid if it was already at the bottom. But looking at the apple position at (5,9), which is above and to the right of the head.

First, I need to consider the body segments given: [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)]. So the snake is along a vertical line on x=7 from y=4 up. The tail is at (7,8). Since the direction is DOWN, moving further down would take it beyond x=9 if not careful.

The apple is at (5,9), which is two units to the left and five units up from the head's current position. So, we need a path that allows the snake to move left multiple times and up enough to reach there without colliding with itself or getting stuck.

Given the movement rules, especially not reversing direction on the first move because if I start moving DOWN again after initially thinking of another direction, it might cause issues later. But wait, since the initial direction is DOWN, maybe that's a mistake? Let me see: if we keep moving DOWN from (7,4), that would take us to (7,5) but then further down beyond grid bounds because the body already occupies up to y=8.

Wait, no—the current position of the head is (7,4), and the body goes up to (7,8). So if we move DOWN again from there, it's possible that in subsequent steps, moving back might cause issues. Maybe I should instead consider a different initial direction first.

But according to the problem statement, the initial direction is DOWN. So on the first move, can't reverse. That means after starting with DOWN, next moves cannot be UP unless we're not reversing anymore?

Wait no—the rules say that you cannot reverse direction immediately after moving in one direction if your current direction was the opposite. For example, if I'm going RIGHT and then can't go LEFT on the next move.

But here, initial direction is DOWN—so the first move must be either UP or RIGHT because moving DOWN again would not reverse. Wait no—the rules say you cannot reverse direction on a single move step; that is, after moving in one direction, the next move cannot be its opposite immediately. So for example, if I'm going RIGHT now, then LEFT is forbidden next.

But since the initial direction is DOWN, which doesn't have an immediate reverse as UP—so maybe it's allowed to go DOWN again? Wait no—the rules say that you can only choose a new direction that isn't the reverse of your current one. So if I'm moving RIGHT now, then LEFT cannot be chosen next step.

But here, initial direction is DOWN—meaning on the first move after starting, we have to choose a direction other than UP (since DOWN's opposite is UP). Wait no—the rules say you can't choose the reverse of your current direction. So if current direction is RIGHT, next can't choose LEFT; same with DOWN and UP.

So in this case, since current direction is DOWN, on the first move after starting, cannot choose UP because that would be reversing. But wait—maybe I'm misunderstanding. The rule says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So it's about choosing opposite directions in consecutive moves.

Therefore, after moving DOWN, the next move cannot be UP because that would be reversing. Wait—no: if I'm going RIGHT now and then go LEFT is forbidden on the next step. But in this case, initial direction is DOWN, so moving UP is allowed? Or not?

Wait—the rule says you can't choose the reverse of your current direction for the next move. So if your current direction is "DOWN", you cannot choose "UP" as the next direction because they are reverses.

So after starting with a direction (DOWN), on the first step, possible directions are RIGHT and LEFT—because moving DOWN again isn't reversing; it's the same direction? Wait no—the movement rules specify that each move proceeds by changing direction based on the current one. So if you're going DOWN now, next move cannot be UP.

But in this case, I need to plan a path from (7,4) towards (5,9). The apple is above and to the left of the head. So moving LEFT would help get closer, but I have to manage the body segments as well.

Wait—current body is [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)]. So from (7,4) being the head, moving RIGHT would take it into the body at (7,5), which is not allowed because the new head can't be on a BODYi unless it's growing after eating. But since we're starting, maybe moving LEFT or UP.

But direction cannot be changed to DOWN immediately again? Or wait—current direction is DOWN; so for next move, cannot choose UP as the reverse.

Wait no—the rules say you cannot reverse your previous direction only if you are already moving in that direction. So from a current position where you were moving DOWN, on the next step, can't choose UP because it's reversing.

But perhaps the first move could be either LEFT or RIGHT since they're not reverses of DOWN. Wait no—the rule says that each new direction cannot be the reverse (i.e., opposite) of your previous one. So if you were moving RIGHT before, now you can't choose LEFT; but moving UP is fine because it's not a reverse from RIGHT.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me restate:

- Current head position: (7,4)
- Body positions: [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)] → so the tail is at (7,8).
- Direction: DOWN.

So for the first move after starting, we have to choose a direction that's not opposite of DOWN. So cannot go UP because that would reverse from DOWN? Or is it that you can't change direction in a way that you're moving back where you came from?

Wait no—the rule says "Cannot reverse": if current direction is UP, next move cannot be DOWN; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So since the initial direction is DOWN, on the first step, we can choose any direction except UP. Because UP would be reversing from DOWN? Or maybe it's that you can't switch directions to their opposites in consecutive moves. So if I was moving DOWN before, now I cannot move UP as next because it's the reverse.

Wait no—the rules say "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So initial direction is DOWN—so on the first step (next move), can't choose UP. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.

But looking at where we need to go: towards LEFT and UP.

Wait—but moving LEFT from (7,4) would take us to x=6, which might be a good start because it's moving away from the body on the right side (since body is up along x=7).

Alternatively, moving RIGHT could cause issues because the body is already at x=7 and y increases—so moving further down would not help towards the apple.

Wait no—if I move RIGHT, that takes me to x=8, but then my next move can't be LEFT. But we need to reach (5,9), which requires going up a lot.

Alternatively, perhaps the first move should be LEFT because it's necessary for getting closer to the apple on the left side and avoiding wall hugging issues.

Wait let me think again: from (7,4), moving LEFT would take us to (6,4). Then the body is along x=7. So this might allow space to maneuver upwards without colliding with the body.

Alternatively, moving UP first—though direction cannot be changed to DOWN now. Wait no—the initial direction was DOWN; so can we move RIGHT or LEFT?

Wait, after starting with a DOWN movement (current head position at 7,4), perhaps I should consider that for next steps, since you're allowed any direction except the reverse of your previous.

So from (7,4), moving DOWN is allowed again? Because if current direction is DOWN, then can't move UP in the next step. But for the first movement after starting, maybe it's okay to go further DOWN as long as it doesn't cause collision with body segments ahead.

Wait no—the snake's body starts at (7,4) as HEAD and [(7,5), ...], so moving DOWN from (7,4) would take us to (7,5)—but that is the first body cell. So according to the rules:

Rule 2: Check for collisions using state before shifting. The snake dies if new_head is in any BODYi except when tail moves. Since after moving down, the new_head is at (7,5), which is in BODY1, so it's a collision—snake dies.

Therefore, can't move DOWN because that would take us into the body.

So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT from (7,4). But moving RIGHT to x=8 might not help since we need to go left. So perhaps moving LEFT first.

So initial move: LEFT → new_head at (6,4).

Check for collision:

- New head is at (6,4); check if this position is in the current body except the tail when it moves again.

Current body before movement: [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)] → none are at (6,4). So no collision.

Then proceed to move LEFT again next step?

Wait no—since now the direction is LEFT. Next move cannot be RIGHT because that's reversing.

But let me try:

First move: LEFT → new_head at (6,4).

Second move can't be RIGHT; possible directions are UP or DOWN.

Moving UP from (6,4) to (6,5): check collision—would it hit any body segments? The current body is [(7,5), ...], so no. So that's allowed.

Third move: cannot go DOWN since previous direction was UP?

Wait initial movement after starting can be either LEFT or RIGHT because they are not reverses of DOWN. Then from there, you have to avoid reversing directions step by step.

So first move: LEFT → (6,4).

Second move options: any except RIGHT if current is UP? Wait no—the previous direction was LEFT; now moving UP would be allowed since it's not a reverse.

Wait the rule says "Cannot choose the reverse of your current direction for the next move." So from any current direction, you can't choose its reverse. So after LEFT, next cannot choose RIGHT; but can choose anything else except LEFT again? No—wait: the rule is about choosing the reverse (i.e., opposite) in consecutive moves.

Wait no—the exact wording is "you may not choose a direction that is reversed." For example, if current is UP, you may not choose DOWN next. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So after any initial movement, the next move can't be its reverse.

But when moving from (7,4) with initial direction DOWN—then on first step, cannot go UP as next; but what about the second step? Since current is DOWN, then no, you can't switch to UP again.

Wait perhaps I need to think in terms of not being able to choose directions that are opposite. So for example, if your last move was RIGHT, you can't choose LEFT now; and vice versa.

But initial direction is DOWN—so after moving in some direction (e.g., LEFT), next move cannot be its reverse.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating the rules about direction reverses on each step. Let's just focus on possible directions at each step based on current position and body layout.

So, starting from (7,4):

- Initial direction: DOWN → can't move UP in next step because it would be a reverse?

Wait no—the initial movement is direction DOWN; but the rule says you may not choose the reverse of your current direction. So if I was going RIGHT before moving down, then can't go LEFT now.

But since we're just starting at (7,4) with direction DOWN—meaning that for next steps after that, cannot move UP as it's reversing from DOWN? Or is direction change only about immediate previous step?

Wait the rule says you may not choose a reversed direction on your next move. So if current direction is RIGHT now, then can't choose LEFT; but in this case, initial direction was DOWN—so moving RIGHT would be allowed.

But perhaps it's better to ignore that for the moment and focus on getting closer to (5,9).

From (7,4), need to get leftwards. So first move: LEFT → (6,4). Then second move can't be RIGHT as previous direction was LEFT.

Wait no—the initial direction is DOWN; so from position (7,4):

First movement after starting could be LEFT or RIGHT since they are not reverses of DOWN. Let's try LEFT to get closer.

So first step: LEFT → new head at (6,4).

Second move can't choose RIGHT because that would reverse the previous direction (LEFT). So possible directions now are DOWN or UP.

But moving DOWN from (6,4) would take us to (6,5), which is a free space since current body doesn't include (6,y). But let's see:

Check for collision: after moving down to (6,5)—is this in the current body? Current body before movement is [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)]—no. So it's safe.

Third move can't be LEFT again since previous direction was DOWN?

Wait no—the directions are:

- Step 1: from initial position moved LEFT → direction now is LEFT.
- Step 2: moved DOWN → current direction now is DOWN.
- Step 3: cannot choose the reverse of current (DOWN) which would be UP. So can move RIGHT or LEFT.

Wait, if in step 3, previous direction was DOWN, so next cannot choose UP; but since it's not a reverse unless you go back to DOWN again?

No—the rule is about consecutive reverses. So moving from LEFT to DOWN is allowed because they're different directions; moving from DOWN to UP would be reversing.

So perhaps in step 3, after moving down (current direction is DOWN), next can't choose UP but can choose any other except its reverse—so since current is DOWN, the only restriction for next move is not to go UP. Wait no—the rule says you may not choose a reversed direction on your next move regardless of previous steps.

Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: The rules state that after each movement, you cannot choose the exact reverse of your last direction in the next step. So if last was RIGHT, can't choose LEFT; same for DOWN and UP.

So from (7,4), initial move is DOWN → current direction is DOWN.

First move: from position to new head at (6,4) after moving LEFT—then previous direction becomes LEFT. Next move cannot be RIGHT because that's the reverse of LEFT.

Second move: From (6,4), moved down to (6,5). Previous direction was DOWN, next can't choose UP as it is the reverse.

Third move from (6,5): possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT (since can't go UP).

Moving LEFT from (6,5) would take us to (5,5)—which seems like a better position because we're getting closer to x=5 where apple is. Let's see:

Check for collision: moving LEFT takes head to (5,5). Current body before movement is [(7,5), ...]. So no collision.

Proceeding further left? Next move from (5,5) can't choose RIGHT as reverse of LEFT.

So next possible moves are DOWN or UP. But moving DOWN could be useful because it allows us to go towards the apple's y position which is higher than current head at 5.

Wait but starting direction after step 3 would have been LEFT again? Or no: each move changes direction based on previous steps, so let me track:

Step 1: LEFT → new_dir = LEFT
Step 2: DOWN → new_dir = DOWN
Step 3: LEFT → new_dir = LEFT (since last was DOWN, can choose any except UP)
Step 4: ??

Wait no—the direction changes per step based on previous move.

Perhaps it's better to map each move and the possible next moves:

Initial position: (7,4), current_dir: DOWN

Move 1:
Possible directions after initial DOWN are LEFT or RIGHT.
Let’s choose LEFT → new head at (6,4)
current_dir is now LEFT.

Move 2:
Can't go reverse of LEFT which is RIGHT. So options: UP, DOWN
But moving up would take us to (6,5), but need to check if that's in current body.

Current body before movement is [(7,5), ...], so no collision at (6,5). So move UP → new head at (6,5)
current_dir now is UP

Move 3:
Can't reverse direction of UP which would be DOWN. So options: LEFT or RIGHT
But moving LEFT from (6,5) takes us to (5,5), which is free.
So Move LEFT → new head at (5,5)
current_dir now is LEFT.

Move 4:
Can't choose RIGHT as it's reverse of LEFT.
Options: DOWN or UP

From (5,5):
Moving DOWN would take us to (5,6) if that position is free. Let me check body segments after movement:

Current body before movement is [(7,5), ...], so no collision at (5,6). So move DOWN.

new head at (5,6)
current_dir now is DOWN

Move 5:
Can't choose UP as reverse of DOWN.
Options: LEFT or RIGHT

From (5,6): moving LEFT would take us to (4,6), which seems too far away from the apple's x=5. Alternatively, move RIGHT towards higher y.

Wait but current_dir was DOWN; can we now go RIGHT? Since previous direction was DOWN, next cannot be UP—but RIGHT is allowed as it’s not a reverse of DOWN.

So moving RIGHT → new head at (6,6). Check for collision: body before movement is [(7,5), ...] which does include (7,5) but none are at (6,6). So no collision.

Proceeding to move RIGHT from (5,6).

new_dir now becomes RIGHT

Move 6:
Can't choose LEFT as reverse of RIGHT.
Options: UP or DOWN

From (6,6), moving UP takes us to (6,7)—check if it's in current body. Current body is [(7,5), ...], no conflict.

So move UP → new head at (6,7)

current_dir now is UP

Move 7:
Can't choose DOWN as reverse of UP.
Options: LEFT or RIGHT

From (6,7): moving LEFT to (5,7) might be useful. Let's see:

Check collision—current body doesn't have any cells at (5,y). So move LEFT → new head at (5,7)

current_dir now is LEFT

Move 8:
Can't choose RIGHT as reverse of LEFT
Options: UP or DOWN

From (5,7): moving UP would take us to (5,8)—which might be good since apple's y=9. But need to check if that position is allowed.

Current body before movement includes [(7,5), ...], so no conflict at (5,8). So move UP → new head at (5,8)

current_dir now is UP

Move 9:
Can't choose DOWN as reverse of UP
Options: LEFT or RIGHT

From (5,8): moving LEFT to (4,8) seems too far left; better try another direction.

Moving RIGHT would take us to (6,8). Check for collision—current body doesn’t have that. So move RIGHT → new head at (6,8)

current_dir now is RIGHT

Move 10:
Can't choose LEFT as reverse of RIGHT
Options: UP or DOWN

From (6,8): moving UP would take us to (6,9), which matches the apple's y-coordinate.

Check for collision—current body before movement has [(7,5), ...], so no conflict at (6,9). So move UP → new head at (6,9)

current_dir now is UP

But wait—we are supposed to reach the exact position of the apple, which is (5,9). Wait this seems off. Did I make a mistake?

Wait in step 7, we moved left from (6,7) to (5,7), and then up to (5,8), right to (6,8), up to (6,9). So current head is at (6,9)—which is one column away from the apple's x=5.

Hmm. Maybe need a different approach after step 7.

Alternatively, perhaps moving differently in earlier steps would allow reaching (5,9).

Let me backtrack a bit.

At move 3: instead of moving LEFT to (5,5), what if I moved RIGHT? Let's try that:

Move 1: LEFT → (6,4)
current_dir = LEFT

Move 2: can't go RIGHT. So options are UP or DOWN
Suppose we choose DOWN from (6,4)→(6,5). Check collision: no.

Move 3:
From (6,5), previous direction was DOWN. Can't move UP now.
So possible directions: LEFT or RIGHT

If I move RIGHT to (7,5): check if that's allowed. Current body is [(7,5), ...]—wait the current_body before movement includes (7,5) which would mean moving right into a cell with body part—so collision occurs.

Therefore, cannot move RIGHT from (6,5). So only option is LEFT to (5,5).

So that brings us back to previous path.

Alternative approach: perhaps after some moves, instead of moving UP or DOWN multiple times, try other directions.

Wait let's think differently. Since the apple is at (5,9), which is left and up from current head at (7,4). Maybe a serpentine movement would be better—i.e., move left to x=5, then up as much as possible without colliding with the body.

But due to body blocks in lower y's, moving up might be tricky. Let me see:

After initial steps:

Move 1: LEFT → (6,4)
Move 2: UP → (6,5)
Move 3: LEFT → (5,5)
Move 4: DOWN → (5,6)
Move 5: RIGHT → (6,6)
Move 6: UP → (6,7)
Move 7: LEFT → (5,7)
Move 8: UP → (5,8)
Move 9: RIGHT → (6,8)
Move 10: UP → (6,9)

Still at x=6. So I need to find a way to get from x=6 back to x=5 without collision.

Alternative idea: Maybe instead of moving UP multiple times, move in another direction when possible.

Wait let's try:

After step 8, head is at (5,8).

Instead of moving RIGHT to (6,8), what if we can find a way to get further left?

But current body after step 7 was [(7,5), (6,6), ...? Wait no—the initial body segments are only the ones given: [(7,5), (something else)].

Wait I think this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to try another path from an earlier point.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to go up first before moving left again.

After step 3: at (5,5). Instead of moving DOWN or UP, but since direction was LEFT in previous step, next can't choose RIGHT—wait no:

Wait after move 2, the current_dir was UP. So move 3 had options as per not reversing UP → which is DOWN; so we have to go either LEFT or RIGHT.

So perhaps when at (5,5), instead of moving LEFT again, maybe another direction is better.

Wait if from (5,5) I can't choose RIGHT because it's reverse of LEFT? Or no—I think the restriction is that you can't move in the exact opposite direction of your last movement. So previous was LEFT; next can’t be RIGHT.

Therefore, moving RIGHT would be a violation.

So perhaps after step 3: from (5,5), I have to choose either DOWN or UP again.

But moving DOWN would take us towards higher x?

No, at (5,5): moving DOWN is impossible because that's same as initial direction; wait no—each move can change the current_dir. Wait each movement changes the head position and updates the current_dir based on previous step.

Wait it might be helpful to structure this as a grid and map out possible positions with directions.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating, perhaps just try another approach:

Start at (7,4), initial direction DOWN

Move 1: LEFT → (6,4)
current_dir = LEFT
Move 2: Can't go RIGHT; options are UP or DOWN. Let's choose UP → (6,5)
current_dir = UP
Move 3: Can't go DOWN; options LEFT or RIGHT. Move LEFT to (5,5)
current_dir = LEFT
Move 4: Can't go RIGHT; options UP or DOWN. Choose DOWN → (5,6)
current_dir = DOWN
Move 5: Can't go UP; options LEFT or RIGHT. Move RIGHT → (6,6)
current_dir = RIGHT
Move 6: Can't go LEFT; options UP or DOWN. Choose UP → (6,7)
current_dir = UP
Move 7: Can't go DOWN; options LEFT or RIGHT. Move LEFT to (5,7)
current_dir = LEFT
Move 8: Can't go RIGHT; options UP or DOWN. Choose DOWN → (5,8)
current_dir = DOWN
Move 9: Can't go UP; options LEFT or RIGHT. Right is allowed → move RIGHT to (6,8)
current_dir = RIGHT
Move 10: Can't go LEFT; options UP or DOWN. Move UP to (6,9)

Now we're at (6,9). The apple is at (5,9)—only one x unit away.

So the current direction was RIGHT—so next move can’t be LEFT.

But from (6,9), possible directions are UP or DOWN since can't go LEFT. Let's try moving LEFT again—if allowed? No, because previous was RIGHT; so now can choose any except LEFT?

Wait no—the rule is that you may not choose the reverse of your last direction—so if last was RIGHT, next cannot be LEFT.

So from (6,9), current_dir is RIGHT:

Move 11: Can't go LEFT. So options are UP or DOWN.

Moving DOWN → (5,9): which is apple's position!

Check for collision: Current body before movement includes [(7,5), ...], so no conflict at (5,9). So move DOWN to (5,9)

So total steps:

1: LEFT
2: UP
3: LEFT
4: DOWN
5: RIGHT
6: UP
7: LEFT
8: DOWN
9: RIGHT
10: UP
11: DOWN

Wait but let's recount each step correctly.

After move 10, we were at (6,9). Current_dir is RIGHT. Next can't go LEFT. So from (6,9):

Move 11: options are UP or DOWN.

Moving DOWN to (5,9) would reach the apple without collision because no body parts are there yet. So yes, that's possible.

So total steps needed:

11 moves?

But wait in each move after initial step, the direction changes as per the rules. Let me verify if this path is valid according to the movement constraints:

Move 1: LEFT (from (7,4)→(6,4))
current_dir = LEFT
Move 2: Can't go RIGHT; choose UP → (6,5)
current_dir = UP
Move 3: Can't go DOWN; choose LEFT → (5,5)
current_dir = LEFT
Move 4: Can't go RIGHT; choose DOWN → (5,6)
current_dir = DOWN
Move 5: Can't go UP; choose RIGHT → (6,6)
current_dir = RIGHT
Move 6: Can't go LEFT; choose UP → (6,7)
current_dir = UP
Move 7: Can't go DOWN; choose LEFT → (5,7)
current_dir = LEFT
Move 8: Can't go RIGHT; choose DOWN → (5,8)
current_dir = DOWN
Move 9: Can't go UP; choose RIGHT → (6,8)
current_dir = RIGHT
Move 10: Can't go LEFT; choose UP → (6,9)
current_dir = UP
Move 11: Can't go DOWN; but wait no—current_dir was UP last time. So next can't be DOWN? Or is it that each move's direction is determined by the previous.

Wait I think I messed up here. Let me correct:

After move 10, we are at (6,9). The current_dir before this move was RIGHT, because after move 10, which was UP from (6,8)→(6,9), so the direction for that move was UP.

Wait no—each move is in a specific direction. So:

Move 1: LEFT → dir = LEFT
Move 2: UP → dir = UP
Move 3: LEFT → dir = LEFT
Move 4: DOWN → dir = DOWN
Move 5: RIGHT → dir = RIGHT
Move 6: UP → dir = UP
Move 7: LEFT → dir = LEFT
Move 8: DOWN → dir = DOWN
Move 9: RIGHT → dir = RIGHT
Move 10: UP → dir = UP
Move 11: ?

Now, after move 10, the direction is UP.

So for move 11, you can't go DOWN because that's reverse of UP. So options are LEFT or RIGHT.

But from (6,9), moving LEFT would be to (5,9)—which is apple's position—so let me check:

Move 11: Can choose LEFT as it's not the reverse of previous direction (UP). Wait no—the rule says you may not go in the exact opposite direction. So if last move was UP, current_dir can't be DOWN; but LEFT or RIGHT are allowed.

So from (6,9), moving LEFT is possible because it's not opposite to UP.

Wait, wait—if your previous movement was UP, then next cannot be DOWN—correct. But LEFT and RIGHT are fine.

Therefore, move 11: LEFT → (5,9)

Yes, that works without collision, as no body parts are there yet.

So total steps: 11 moves.

But is this the minimal number? Or can we find a shorter path?

Alternatively, maybe after step 7, instead of moving UP to (6,8), move DOWN or something else. But since in each case I have limited options due to body blocks and movement rules, it's unclear if there's a faster way.

Another idea: perhaps when at (5,5) we can find another path that doesn't require so many moves.

But given time constraints, maybe this is the solution.

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 9). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
