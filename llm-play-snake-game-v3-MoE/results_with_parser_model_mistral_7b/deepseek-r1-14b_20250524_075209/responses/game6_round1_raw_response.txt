========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (9,5). Let's see. The head is currently at (5,5), and the direction is NONE, which means any move is allowed as long as it doesn't reverse on the first step.

First, I need to plan a path that leads the snake towards the apple without causing collisions. Since the apple is directly to the right of the head, moving RIGHT seems like the most straightforward approach. However, I should consider if there are any body segments in the way or if moving in another direction might be safer.

Looking at the body cells list, it's empty, so the snake is only the head and no body parts except for maybe the tail when it moves. Wait, the body cells provided exclude the head and go from the segment immediately behind to the tail. Since the body is an empty list, that means the snake has a length of 1 (just the head). So, moving towards the apple directly should be safe.

But wait, the initial state says the direction is NONE, which allows any first move without reversing. The goal is to reach (9,5), which is four steps to the right. So, I need four RIGHT moves: from 5→6, 6→7, 7→8, 8→9 in x-coordinate.

I should make sure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any body parts. Since there are no body segments (length is 1), moving right repeatedly shouldn't cause collisions unless the snake's own body gets in the way, but since it's only the head and tail hasn't moved yet, it should be fine.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment. So, when it reaches (9,5), the next move must leave at least one legal option to prevent trapping. But for now, focusing on reaching the apple is the priority.

So, the plan is to move RIGHT four times. Let me check if this would cause any issues:

1. Move 1: from (5,5) → (6,5). Safe.
2. Move 2: from (6,5) → (7,5). Safe.
3. Move 3: from (7,5) → (8,5). Safe.
4. Move 4: from (8,5) → (9,5). Here, the new head is at the apple's position.

After eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment. The body will now include the previous positions, but since we only had the head before, adding segments shouldn't cause a problem as long as the path remains clear.

I should also ensure that after growing, there's at least one move left. Since we've reached the apple, the next move would be from (9,5), and possible directions could be DOWN or UP, depending on grid boundaries, but since it's a 10x10 grid, moving up is possible.

Wait, the coordinates are from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. So, moving UP increases y by 1, and DOWN decreases it. Since the apple is at (9,5), moving UP or DOWN after eating would be possible as long as it doesn't hit walls.

But since the problem only requires the moves up to eating the apple, I don't need to plan beyond that. So, four RIGHT moves should suffice.
