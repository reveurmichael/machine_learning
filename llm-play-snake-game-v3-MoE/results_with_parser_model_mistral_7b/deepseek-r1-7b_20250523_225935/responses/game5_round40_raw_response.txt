========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where I need to find a safe path for the snake's head from (8,3) to reach the apple at (8,2). The snake's current state includes its body parts and direction. Let me break down what I know.

First, the snake's head is at (8,3), facing DOWN. The body cells are [(8,4), (8,5)], which means behind the head is a segment at (8,4) and then (8,5). The apple is right below the head at (8,2).

Since the snake can't reverse direction on its first move, I have to make sure my initial moves don't cause it to go back. Also, each move must keep the body continuous without overlapping itself.

Looking at the movement rules, after each step:
1. Compute the new head position.
2. Check for collisions with walls or other body segments (excluding the tail's new position).
3. Update the body: add the old head and remove the tail unless eating an apple.

I need to plan a series of moves that will allow the snake to reach (8,2) without getting stuck. Since the apple is directly below the head, moving DOWN seems like the logical first step. But wait, if I move down from (8,3), the new head would be at (8,4). Is this position occupied by a body segment? Yes, there's a segment at (8,4) in the body list. So moving down immediately after the initial direction might cause a collision with the body segment.

Hmm, so maybe I can't move DOWN first because that would result in hitting the tail at (8,4). What about another direction then?

What if I try to move LEFT? From (8,3), moving LEFT takes me to (7,3). Is this position free? The current body is at (8,4) and (8,5), so it's empty. Also, the next body cells will be updated accordingly.

Wait, but can I move LEFT when facing DOWN? Yes, because the direction choice isn't restricted unless it's a reverse. So moving LEFT first might help avoid immediate collision.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT would take me to (9,3), which is beyond the grid since x ranges from 0-9. Wait no, 9 is within bounds. Or does it? The grid coordinates go up to 9, so moving RIGHT would be valid as long as y doesn't exceed.

Wait, let's think again: the grid is 10x10 with (0,0) at bottom-left and (9,9) at top-right. So from (8,3), moving RIGHT takes x+1 to 9, which is within bounds since 9 < 10.

But wait, after moving RIGHT to (9,3), the next step would be inserting (8,3) as the new head and shifting the body. The current body is [(8,4), (8,5)], so the new body becomes [(9,3), (8,3)]. But that's a valid move since it's adjacent.

But does moving RIGHT help me get to (8,2)? Probably not directly because I'm moving away from the apple. So maybe LEFT or UP would be better.

Wait, but if I consider the final position check: x1=8 and x2=8, so #RIGHT - #LEFT should be 0. Y moves are from y1=3 to y2=2, which is a decrease of 1, so #DOWN - #UP =1. So overall, in total moves, I need one more DOWN than other directions except for RIGHT and LEFT.

But since the snake can't reverse on the first move, if it's facing DOWN initially, moving UP would be allowed unless it was just a reverse.

Wait no, the first move after being facing DOWN is allowed to be any direction except DOWN again because you can't reverse. Or does that apply only when not at the first step?

Wait, according to the rules: "current direction is 'DOWN'—you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed."

So since initial direction is DOWN, I cannot choose DOWN again in my first move. That means first move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Wait no: the rule says "cannot reverse", so if you're facing DOWN, you cannot turn to face UP next because that's a reverse (as UP is opposite of DOWN). Similarly for other directions.

So from initial direction DOWN, possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT only on the first step. Wait no—wait, does reversing apply? So in general, after each move, if your current direction is DOWN, you cannot choose UP next; but can you change it to another direction except for its opposite?

Wait, the rule says: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "DOWN", you may not choose "UP" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT".

So after facing DOWN, next move can't be UP.

But initial first move can be any allowed. Since initially facing DOWN, so on the first step, cannot go UP (since it's a reverse), but LEFT and RIGHT are okay because they're not opposites of DOWN.

Wait no: according to rule 2: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT".

So facing DOWN, the opposite is UP. So on first move after being DOWN, cannot go UP again because it's a reverse.

Wait no, perhaps I'm misapplying: if initial direction is DOWN, then in the first move you can't choose UP (as that would be reversing from DOWN to UP). But other directions like LEFT or RIGHT are allowed as they're not reverses of each other or of DOWN.

So for example, after facing DOWN, next moves cannot include UP. So possible moves are LEFT and RIGHT only on the first step?

Wait no: rule 2 says "You may not choose 'DOWN' if current direction is 'UP', similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is NONE (start), any first move allowed."

So, facing DOWN initially means you can't choose UP next. So possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT on the first step.

Wait no: perhaps "current direction" refers to the previous movement's direction. For example, if I was moving DOWN last time, now my current direction is DOWN, so cannot go UP again. But initial direction is NONE, meaning any move is allowed except for rules about reversal based on the current direction after a move.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think that each step after movement determines your next possible moves based on your new direction.

But perhaps for this problem, since I'm starting with direction DOWN, my first move can be LEFT or RIGHT because UP is the reverse of DOWN and thus prohibited as the next move.

Wait no: if you're moving in a certain direction now (DOWN), your next move cannot be UP. But after that, movement depends on current direction again.

This might complicate things. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Since I can't immediately go DOWN because that's my current direction and perhaps not prohibited unless it's the same step.

Wait no: initial direction is DOWN; first move can't be UP (reverse). So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? But NONE would mean moving into a cell adjacent to head in some other way?

Wait, but you have to plan a path. Maybe starting by moving LEFT will help avoid immediate collisions.

So let's consider the initial state: head at (8,3), body [(8,4),(8,5)], apple at (8,2).

First move options:

1. UP: Can't do because current direction is DOWN; but maybe it's allowed? Wait no—rule says you may not choose "DOWN" next, but can I choose UP?

Wait rule 2: Cannot reverse. So if current direction is "DOWN", cannot choose "UP". So first move after initial direction of DOWN cannot be UP.

So possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT only on the first step.

Alternatively, no—if you're allowed to change directions non-reversely, then perhaps moving left is fine even though it's a turn. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this; let's stick with the rule that after initial DOWN direction, can't move UP next.

So options: LEFT or RIGHT on first step.

Let me try moving LEFT to (7,3). Now head is at (7,3), body becomes [(8,4), (8,5), (7,3)]? Wait no:

Wait movement rules say that the new_head is computed first. Then if no collision, update the body by inserting old head and removing tail.

So initial state: S = [head=(8,3), BODY1=(8,4), BODY2=(8,5)]

First move options: LEFT to (7,3). So new_head=(7,3). Check for collision with existing body segments except tail when it moves. Existing body is [(8,4),(8,5)]. New head at (7,3) is not in the current body, so no collision.

Then update body by inserting old head (8,3) at front and removing tail (8,5). So new S = [(7,3), (8,4), (8,5)] with tail now at (8,4).

Wait but after moving LEFT to (7,3), the snake's body is now [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5)]. Wait no: initial body was [head, body1, body2], so inserting head (8,3) and removing tail (8,5). So new body becomes [(7,3)] + [old body elements except last]. So the new body after moving LEFT is [(7,3), (8,4), (8,5)]. Wait no: initial body was [(8,4), (8,5)], so inserting head at front and removing tail gives [(7,3), 8,4], but that's only two elements. But the movement rules say when you move into an empty cell (not a body segment except possibly for one before the first move if it's an apple). So in this case, moving LEFT to (7,3) is valid.

But after this step, snake becomes [new_head, rest of previous body]. So yes, [(7,3), 8,4, 8,5], but wait—no: initial body was two elements. After inserting new head and removing tail, the body will have one more than before?

Wait no: movement rules:

- Compute new_head.

- Check for collision with existing body (excluding the last element).

- Insert new_head as first element of new body list.

- Remove last element (old tail) unless it was at position where apple is. But in this case, not eating an apple.

So initial body after step: [new_head] + rest of previous body excluding last.

Wait no—the movement says:

"S = [you], your body cells are S. So when you move into a new cell (not occupied by any body cell except perhaps the first one if it's the first move and you have only one body cell in front)", then you update the body to be [new_head] + rest of previous body.

Wait no, rule says:

"Update the snake: You create a new snake. If you don't eat an apple, your new snake is formed by inserting as the first element the current position (i.e., head) into S and removing the last element."

So if initial S was [A, B, C], moving to D results in [D, A, B]. So regardless of previous length.

Wait no: actually, for each step:

If you are not eating an apple, then new_body = [new_head] + S[1:]

Because the tail is removed unless... Wait wait—no, rule says if don't eat apple, insert current head into front and remove last element. So for initial body [(8,4), (8,5)], moving to (7,3) would result in new_body = [new_head] + S → which is [(7,3)] + [(8,4), (8,5)]? But that's 3 elements.

Wait no: original S has length len(S). After the move, you add one element at front and remove one from end. So if S was of length N, new body becomes [new_head] + S[0:N-1].

So in our case:

S initially is [(8,4), (8,5)].

After moving to (7,3):

new_body = [(7,3)] + [8,4], which makes [(7,3), 8,4]. Wait that's two elements. But the initial body had two elements; adding one and removing last gives same length? No: new_head is added as first element, then all previous except last are kept.

So in this case:

new_body = [ (7,3) ] + [8,4] → because S[0:N-1], N=2, so index 0 to 1 exclusive. So only first element of initial body remains.

Wait no: if you remove the last element, then yes—so moving from [(A,B)] becomes [new_head, A].

So after first move LEFT, new_body is [(7,3), (8,4)], tail at (8,4).

But in that case, when I proceed further, can I have a body with two segments.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake's body length remains same. Because you add one and remove one—so overall, the number of elements in S is preserved?

Yes, because new_body = [new_head] + old_S[0:-1], so it removes last element and adds new at front; hence the length remains same as before.

So initial move: moving LEFT leads to new head (7,3), body [(8,4)], since initial was two elements. So after first move, S is [ (7,3), 8,4 ]? Or wait—no, initial was [(8,4), (8,5)]; when you remove last element, it's 8,5, so new_body becomes [new_head, 8,4].

So yes.

But then, in next steps, how does the body change?

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better to avoid immediate collision with current body at (8,4).

Let me try another approach: instead of moving left first, perhaps move up? But wait initial direction is DOWN; can I choose UP as a reverse? No—rule says you cannot choose UP if your current direction is DOWN.

So no. So on the first step after facing DOWN, possible moves are LEFT and RIGHT only.

Thus, must pick between LEFT or RIGHT for first move.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP isn't allowed because of rule 2 (reverse), so options limited to LEFT and RIGHT.

Wait but from initial position, can I move in a different direction that is not LEFT or RIGHT? Like moving into an adjacent cell in some other way?

No. Because movement rules require new head must be adjacent.

So, perhaps first step is either LEFT or RIGHT; UP is prohibited as reverse.

Suppose I choose to move LEFT. Then next steps will have the snake's body at (7,3), followed by 8,4.

Wait no: after moving LEFT from 8,3 to 7,3:

new_body = [7,3] + old_body_without_last → which is [(8,4)], so S becomes [(7,3), (8,4)].

Now next move options:

From head at (7,3). Current body is [(8,4)]. Tail will be moved as per step.

Possible moves: from LEFT to RIGHT and DOWN.

But moving DOWN would take me to (7,4); current direction is LEFT now. But let's see if that causes collision or not.

New head for next move:

Option 1: Move UP: back to (8,3), which was the original position; but then after new_head=(8,3):

Check collisions—body at [(8,4)], so no conflict except when moving into apple? Wait, I'm trying to avoid eatingapple in this path.

Wait if not eating an apple, just move towards it. Hmm, maybe a better approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct first step after initial direction of DOWN is to move RIGHT instead of LEFT.

So starting again: head at (8,3), body [(8,4),(8,5)].

First move option: RIGHT → new_head=(9,3). Check for collision with current body. The current body has (8,4) and (8,5); (9,3) is free.

Update the body by inserting old head (8,3) at front; then removing last element of initial body [(8,4), (8,5)] → new_body becomes [ (9,3), 8,4 ].

So now snake's S = [(9,3), (8,4)]. Next step: from (9,3), facing DOWN. Now direction is RIGHT? No—original direction was DOWN; moving right changes the current direction to RIGHT?

Wait no: initial direction after first move would be based on the movement of the head.

So after moving RIGHT, new_head is at (9,3). Current direction becomes RIGHT because that's where it moved from previous position.

But how does this affect next moves? Maybe it complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe a different approach—planning to snake down towards apple without collision. But since apple is behind me and body blocks the way, perhaps need to create space in front or something else.

Wait another thought: if I can move in such a way that I can have an empty path ahead of me when moving towards the apple.

But currently, from (8,3), my body is at (8,4) behind. So if I turn around and head back down to create space?

Alternatively, perhaps making the snake's body allow for turning into another direction.

Wait but initial position: head (8,3). Body [(8,4),(8,5)].

If I move UP from (8,3), new_head would be (7,3). But as per rules, can't choose reverse of current direction. If facing DOWN now, is moving UP allowed? Or was the initial movement considered for first step?

No—initial direction is DOWN; so in that case, if you were to move from (8,3) to (7,3), which would be a turn but not a reverse.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try moving LEFT as first step and see how it goes:

First step: Move LEFT → new_head=(7,3). New body becomes [(7,3), 8,4]. Direction now is LEFT.

Second move options from (7,3): can choose any direction except reverse of current. Current direction was LEFT; so next cannot go RIGHT? No—rule says after facing left, you cannot turn to right or something?

Wait rule says: "Cannot reverse": if current direction is DOWN, you may not choose UP next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So from moving LEFT now (current direction is LEFT), the next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are DOWN, LEFT again, or NONE? Or perhaps after moving LEFT, your current direction becomes LEFT, so in next step, cannot reverse to RIGHT?

Wait rule 2 says: "You may not choose 'DOWN' if current direction is 'UP', similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'."

So facing left now, can't choose right next. So possible moves are UP or DOWN (since LEFT and RIGHT would be in same axis), but also considering the rules.

Wait maybe it's better to see that each time you move, your current direction is determined by where you came from. For example:

- If moving from position A to B, then previous movement was towards some direction; so next can't reverse that unless allowed (but in this case, since initial movement after DOWN was LEFT or RIGHT, next step cannot reverse it).

Wait maybe getting tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is a standard algorithm for solving snake-like mazes—using BFS to find the shortest path without hitting walls and avoiding body cells except when eating an apple. But given that in this case we don't eat any apple (since only goal is to reach position), but need to have the head not collide with its own body.

But as it's a problem for programming competition, perhaps we can model each state as:

Current head position, current direction, and the snake's body configuration. But that might be complex due to memory constraints.

Alternatively, since apple isn't eaten in this case (the problem is only about reaching apple without eating any apples), maybe treating it as a simple pathfinding where you need to reach (8,3) from your starting position—wait no, wait: initial position is (8,3); the snake's head is at (8,3). The body blocks certain cells. So perhaps moving towards (9,4).

Wait apple is at (8,5), which was one of the body cells.

So since we can't enter (8,5) because it's blocked by the body unless we eat an apple, and as per problem statement, we are to find a path where the head reaches (8,5). So perhaps the approach is similar to snake game, but without having to eat apples—so the only concern is not colliding with own body.

Thus, in this case, since initial position has the head at (8,3), and body cells behind it are (8,4) and (8,5); so moving towards another direction would create space ahead of me. For example:

Move right to 9,3—so now I can move forward into new empty cell.

But then from there, need to navigate back around the blocked area.

Wait perhaps a better way is to visualize the current body as blocking certain cells in front and behind.

Alternatively, think about this problem as finding a path for the head (snake's head) towards (8,5), considering that when moving forward, each subsequent cell must be unoccupied by the body. Since we aren't eating apples, our goal is to reach apple without entering any blocked cells.

Thus, perhaps using BFS where each state represents the current position of the snake's head and a representation of its body—though representing the entire body might complicate things in terms of memory.

But given that the problem doesn't require finding the shortest path but rather just whether it is possible to reach (8,5) without colliding with own body, perhaps we can model each state as:

- Current head position

- Whether moving up/down/left/right—current direction.

Because for this specific case, since the snake's body only occupies three cells: [ (8,4), (8,5) ] when facing down; but after moving LEFT or RIGHT, it may change. So perhaps each state is manageable with these parameters.

Alternatively, given that in each step we're only changing by one cell in any of four directions, and the snake's body length remains same (since adding head and removing tail), which for this initial case was two cells—so in general, the snake can be represented as a list; but perhaps for BFS purposes, it's manageable.

But given that each step is only moving one cell, maybe we can model it with the current head position, direction, and body.

Wait, another thought: since after each move, the new_head becomes [new_head] + old_body[0:-1], which effectively shifts the snake forward by one cell. So for this specific problem, where the initial body is two cells behind me (at down direction), perhaps moving to LEFT or RIGHT allows creating a longer 'path' ahead.

Wait maybe if I move RIGHT:

First step: Move right → new_head at 9,3; body becomes [9,3], 8,4].

Then second step: from there, where can I go? Maybe down to (9,4). Then third step... but not sure.

Alternatively, moving left first:

new_head=7,3→ body = [(7,3),8,4]

From here, perhaps move forward into a new direction. But without the apple in path.

Wait since initial head is at 8,3; trying to reach 8,5 requires passing through (8,4) and then (8,5). Since snake's body has those two cells occupied, so cannot go directly towards it—must find an alternate route.

Alternatively, perhaps by moving left or right first, creating a gap that allows the snake to move back into the desired direction after that.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe need to model this as a BFS problem with each state being (x,y) and the body positions. But for efficiency, given it's 8x5 grid, perhaps manageable.

Let me think about possible steps:

Starting at (8,3), body cells: (8,4), (8,5).

Option 1: Move LEFT to 7,3; new body is [7,3],8,4].

Now from here, can I move DOWN? Let's see where that takes me.

Move down would be (7,4). Check for collision with current body—body is [(8,4), ... Wait no: after first step, the body was [7,3], 8,4]. So moving to 7,4:

Check if any cell in path of movement leads into a body segment.

Wait in this case, movement from (7,3) to (7,4)—is that blocked?

The initial body is [(8,4), ... no—wait the body after first step is [7,3], 8,4]. So when moving down to (7,4):

Is any cell in my path colliding with existing body? No.

So new_head=(7,4); then update the body by inserting previous head at front and removing last element. So:

new_body = [(7,4),7,3], 8,4]?

Wait no: initial body after first step was [7,3],8,4].

After moving down to (7,4):

new_body becomes [7,4, 7,3].

But wait that would create two cells at same position—no; the snake can't have overlapping cells.

So that's invalid. Thus movement is not allowed because new_head is adjacent but adding it and removing last element creates duplicate cell.

Wait no: in this case:

After moving down from (7,3) to 7,4.

Inserting into front → [7,4].

Then remove the tail which was at position (8,5), wait initial body after first move was [(8,4)]?

No—after first step when moved LEFT→ new_body is [7,3], followed by 8,4. Because in this case, moving to left, we added previous head as first element and removed last of old body.

So old body was (8,4), (8,5) → length two; after moving left:

new_body = [(7,3)] + [8,4] → which is now 8,4 only?

Wait no: initial body had two elements. So when you remove the last element, new body becomes one element—wait but then movement would make snake shorter.

No—that can't be right because in each step, adding a new head and removing tail keeps the same number of segments as before.

So from S = [A,B,C], moving to D: new_S is [D,A,B].

Thus:

Initial body after first move when moved left→ [(7,3), 8,4] (because previous body was two elements; adding new_head and removing last).

But then, next step when trying to move down from (7,3) to 7,4.

So new_head = 7,4. Check if any of the path between old head and new_head contains a blocked cell.

Wait movement is one cell in four directions—so just check if new_head's position is unoccupied.

After moving left first step: body was [(7,3),8,4].

Then attempting to move down from (7,3) to 7,4:

Is 7,4 already in the body? The current body has [8,4], which is adjacent. So moving down would land on a cell that's not part of body.

So new_head=7,4; then update body as [(7,4), (7,3)] + ?

Wait wait no: initial body after first step was two elements—[(7,3),8,4].

After moving to 7,4→ insert into front and remove last element:

new_body = [7,4] + [ (7,3) ] → since previous body had two elements; we add new_head and keep the rest except last.

Wait that would make a three-element list? Or just appending in this way?

No—wait each step adds one head and removes last tail. So:

After first move: S becomes [(7,3), 8,4] → two elements.

Second move to (7,4): new_body = [7,4] + [ (8,4) ]? No, that would be adding the previous body except last element—wait no: initial body is [A,B]. After moving to D, it's [D,A].

So in this case, after second move:

new_body becomes [7,4, 7,3], which has two elements.

Wait but 8,4 was part of old body? No—the new body would be inserting D and removing B—so from (A,B) → to (D,A).

But if the previous step's body after moving left is [(7,3),8,4], then next move:

new_head=7,4→ then new_body = [7,4] + [ (7,3) ].

Thus:

Body becomes [(7,4), 7,3].

Is that possible? So two segments: head at (7,4) and tail at (7,3). But since these are adjacent cells, it's a valid configuration—snake has length of two. So yes, allowed.

Then in next step, can I move forward into new directions?

From 7,4→ try moving right to 8,4; but is that cell occupied? The current body after second step was [ (7,4),7,3 ], so if you moved right from (7,4) to 8,4: check for collision.

But the snake's body only occupies positions [(7,4),7,3]. So moving to 8,4 is unoccupied. Then update new_body by adding head at front and removing last:

new_head=8,4; so new_body = [8,4] + [ (7,4) ] → which is [(8,4),7,4].

Then next step: from 8,4→ moving up to 8,5.

Wait the current body after third move is [(8,4),7,4]. So moving upward:

new_head=8,5. Is that position unoccupied?

In this case, initial body was (8,3) → no; but snake's head is now at (8,4). Moving up to 8,5: the current body has [7,4] as tail.

So new_body becomes [(8,5),8,4]. Which would be allowed. Now, in this configuration:

The snake's head is at (8,5)—the apple position! So we've reached it successfully.

But wait did that work? Let me retrace the steps to make sure no collision occurred.

1. Start at (8,3), body [(8,4), 8,5].

2. Move left to (7,3); new_body = [7,3], 8,4]. 

   - Check: movement from 8,3→7,3 is unblocked? Yes because the previous body was behind.

3. From (7,3), move down to 7,4; new_body becomes [7,4, 7,3].

   - No collision as 7,4 wasn't occupied before.

4. From 7,4→ move right to 8,4; new_body is [8,4], 7,4]. 

5. Then from (8,4), move up to (8,5); check if it's blocked: previous body was [(7,4)]. So moving upward would land on 8,5 which isn't in the current body.

Wait but wait—the snake's body is [8,4], then after moving to 8,5:

new_body becomes [(8,5), (8,4)]—so two segments at positions (8,5) and (8,4). But those are adjacent. So it's valid.

But in the initial step, when we move left from (8,3)→7,3; then down to 7,4 → new_body is [7,4,7,3]. Then moving right: add 8,4 as head and remove tail at position 7,3. So now body is [8,4,7,4].

Then from there, move up to (8,5): which isn't in the current body, so it's allowed.

Thus this path seems valid:

(8,3) → left→7,3→ down→7,4→ right→8,4→up→8,5.

Wait but how about checking if any of these steps create collisions? Because when moving to a new cell, you have to make sure that the path is clear—except for the body behind and front, perhaps?

Alternatively, since each movement only affects the head and tail in such a way that the middle remains the same as before.

In this case:

After step 1: snake is at [7,3],8,4].

Step 2: move down→[7,4,7,3].

No collision because new_head (7,4) isn't occupied by body except previous head. So it's allowed.

Wait in the second step movement from 7,3 to 7,4:

Is cell at (7,4) already part of the current snake? The current body is [7,3], so no—only two cells: new_head and one more which was added when moving left. So it's allowed.

Similarly for other steps—it seems that each movement doesn't cause collision with body except the initial blockages.

Thus this path leads to (8,5) in four moves:

1. Left→7,3
2. Down→7,4
3. Right→8,4
4. Up→8,5

So yeah, it's possible.

But wait: during movement step 3, moving from 7,4 right to 8,4 is allowed because the body doesn't include 8,4 at that point—only after adding new_head and removing tail.

Yes:

In third move, after step two, the body was [7,4], followed by previous head (7,3). Wait no: initial body after first move left was [(7,3),8,4]. Then moving down to 7,4 makes new_body = [7,4,7,3].

So when in third move:

Move from (7,4) right→8,4. Check if that cell is blocked by any part of the body.

The current body after second step was [(7,4),7,3]. So moving to 8,4: is there a segment at 8,4? No—current body doesn't have 8,4 yet because previous move added it as new_head and then removed tail (which was 8,5). Or wait:

No. Let me re-examine.

After first step: S = [7,3],8,4].

Second step moving down from 7,3 to 7,4→ new_body is [7,4] + previous body without last element (8,4) → so new_body becomes [(7,4),7,3].

Third step: move right from (7,4) to 8,4. Check if cell is blocked by any part of current body.

Current body after second step has [ (7,4),7,3 ]—so when moving to 8,4:

Is there a snake segment at 8,4? No—because the new_body was [(7,4),7,3]. So movement allowed. Then update new_body as inserting head and removing tail.

So adding 8,4 to front and remove last element (7,3):

new_body = [8,4],7,4].

Then fourth step: move up from (8,4)→8,5:

Check if current body has any overlapping with that position. Current body is [(8,4),7,4]. So moving to 8,5 isn't in the body.

Update new_body by inserting head and removing last element of previous body:

new_head=8,5; so new_body = [8,5,8,4].

Thus, snake's head has reached (8,5)—the apple!

So yes, this path is valid.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at (8,3) towards the apple located at (8,5). The snake can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right), and it cannot collide with its own body cells except when eating an apple. Since there's no apple involved here, our goal is to reach the apple without colliding with any part of the snake's body.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (8,3) with its body occupying the cells (8,4) and (8,5). This means the snake is facing downwards from its head.
2. **Pathfinding Strategy**: We need to explore possible moves step by step, ensuring that each move does not result in a collision with any part of the snake's body except for when eating an apple. Given the constraints, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible paths from the current head position.
3. **Movement and Collision Check**: For each move, check if the new head position is within bounds and not occupied by any part of the snake's body except for when eating an apple. If a valid move is found, update the snake's body configuration accordingly.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import deque

def can_reach_apple():
    # Initial state: head at (8,3), body cells at (8,4) and (8,5)
    start = (8, 3)
    apple = (8, 5)
    body = {(8,4), (8,5)}
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]  # up, down, left, right

    queue = deque()
    visited = set()

    initial_head = start
    if initial_head in body:
        return False  # head is part of the body, impossible
    
    queue.append((start, frozenset(body.copy())))
    visited.add(frozenset(body.copy()))

    while queue:
        current_pos, snake_body = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            next_pos = (current_pos[0] + dx, current_pos[1] + dy)
            
            if next_pos == apple:
                return True
            
            # Check if next_pos is within bounds
            if 1 <= next_pos[0] <= 8 and 1 <= next_pos[1] <= 8:
                # Check if next_pos is not in the current snake body (except for when eating apple, which isn't our case here)
                if next_pos not in snake_body:
                    new_snake = set(snake_body)
                    new_snake.add(next_pos)
                    key = frozenset(new_snake)
                    if key not in visited:
                        visited.add(key)
                        queue.append((next_pos, key))
    
    return False

print(can_reach_apple())
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial State**: The snake starts at (8,3) with its body occupying the cells (8,4) and (8,5). This means it's facing downwards.
2. **BFS Exploration**: Using BFS ensures that we explore all possible paths level by level, which helps in finding the shortest path efficiently.
3. **Movement Check**: For each potential move, we check if the new head position is valid (within bounds and not part of the current snake body).
4. **Update State**: Upon a valid move, update the snake's body configuration and continue exploring further moves until either reaching the apple or determining it's unreachable.

This approach ensures that we systematically explore all possible paths while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body, ultimately allowing us to determine if reaching the apple is possible.
