========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (4,8) to (6,0). The snake can move RIGHT two times and DOWN eight times because the head needs to go right twice (from 4 to 6) and down eight times (from 8 to 0).

First, I need to check if moving right twice is possible without hitting any walls or body segments. Since it's a 10x10 grid, going right from x=4 to x=6 shouldn't hit the wall immediately because x=5 and x=6 are within bounds.

Next, for the downward moves, I need to make sure that each step down doesn't land on any of the body segments. The current body is at (3,8), so moving down from (4,8) would go to (4,7). But wait, there's a body segment behind it? No, the provided body cells are [(3,8)], which is actually in front of the head but not directly in front because the snake moves right. So when we move RIGHT first, the head goes to (5,8), then maybe down steps can be taken without hitting any body.

Wait, no—the current position after moving RIGHT would have the new head at (5,8). Then, the next steps would involve moving DOWN from there. But I need to ensure that each move doesn't cause a collision with the body. Since the initial body is only at (3,8), which is two cells behind in x but same y as the current head's y.

After moving RIGHT twice, the head will be at (6,8). Then we start moving DOWN from there. Each step should check if the next cell is empty and not occupied by any part of the body or tail.

We also need to make sure that when moving right, after each move, the snake's body remains continuous without overlapping. Since the initial body has only one segment at (3,8), as we move down, the new head would be safe until it reaches (6,0).

Another thing is to check if any of these moves cause immediate self-collision when not eating the apple. Since moving right twice and then eight times down won't trigger any apple consumption except for the final step.

Wait, no—the snake only eats the apple on its last move if it steps onto (6,0). So during all previous steps, it shouldn't be eating anything else.

So planning the moves as RIGHT x2 followed by DOWN y8 should work. This will take 10 moves total: two to the right and eight down.

To navigate from position (4,8) to (6,0), we need to move Right twice and then Down eight times while ensuring no collisions with walls or body segments.
