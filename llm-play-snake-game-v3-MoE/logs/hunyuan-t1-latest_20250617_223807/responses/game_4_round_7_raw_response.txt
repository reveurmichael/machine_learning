========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left (7 times) and down (2 times) to reach the apple at (1,2). Starting with a DOWN move avoids reversing direction and safely positions the head. Subsequent LEFT moves navigate leftward, avoiding body collisions as the tail shifts. A final DOWN move reaches the apple, ensuring a legal next move (e.g., LEFT) afterward."
