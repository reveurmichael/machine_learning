========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 5 times (to reach x=0) and down 4 times (to reach y=3). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing direction and moves toward the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent LEFT moves continue leftward, then DOWN moves adjust the y-coordinate. Each move is checked for collisions with the body (which shifts safely) and stays within grid bounds. After reaching the apple, a legal move (RIGHT) remains, preventing entrapment."
