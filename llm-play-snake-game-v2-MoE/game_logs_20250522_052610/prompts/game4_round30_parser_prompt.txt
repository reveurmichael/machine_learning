Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this Snake problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the snake's head is at (2,3), and the apple is at (5,1). The body of the snake is given as [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]. The current direction is DOWN. I need to plan a path for the head to reach the apple without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds.

Let me visualize the grid. Since it's a 10x10 grid, coordinates go from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So y increases as we go up.

The snake is currently moving DOWN. The next move can't be UP because that would reverse direction. So the first move has to be either LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN, but I need to check if moving in those directions is safe.

Looking at the body cells: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]. The head is at (2,3). So from (2,3), moving down would take it to (2,2), which isn't part of the body yet. But wait, when the snake moves, the body shifts. Hmm, no—the body cells are the current positions excluding the head, so after each move, the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

But for now, I need to make sure that the next move doesn't cause the new head position to collide with any part of the body.

Let's see where each possible first move would take the head:

1. DOWN: from (2,3) → (2,2). Check if (2,2) is in the body? The body cells are [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]. No, so that's safe.

But wait, after moving DOWN, the body would shift. So the new head is (2,2), and the tail (which is (2,4)) would be removed because we didn't eat an apple yet. But since this is just a move without eating, I need to make sure that all subsequent moves won't cause collision with the updated body.

But maybe it's better to plan the path first.

The apple is at (5,1), which is further right and down from the head. So x increases by 3 (from 2 to 5) and y decreases by 2 (from 3 to 1). So we need more RIGHT moves than LEFT, and more DOWN than UP.

Constraints on moves: number of RIGHT - LEFT = 3, and number of DOWN - UP = 2. Since currently moving DOWN, first move can't be UP because that's a reversal.

Wait, the current direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP, right? Because rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. So if the snake is going DOWN, it can't go UP next. But in this case, since we're starting with direction DOWN, and the first move cannot reverse. Wait, no: the current direction is DOWN, so next move can be any except UP (since that's reversing). Or wait, rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is DOWN, then next direction can't be UP.

So for the first move, possible options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Let me see each possibility:

Option 1: Move DOWN to (2,2).

Is that safe? Yes, because none of the body cells are at (2,2). After moving, the body would shift. The new body after this move would be [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)], assuming we didn't eat an apple.

Wait, no: when you move without eating an apple, the tail is removed. So original body was [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ]. After moving DOWN to (2,2), the new body would be the previous body except the last element (which is (2,4)) is gone, and the head becomes (2,2). So new body cells are [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ].

So after moving DOWN, the body is [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)] and the head is at (2,2). Then next moves need to avoid these positions.

But I'm not sure if this path will lead us towards the apple. Maybe it's better to move RIGHT first.

Option 2: Move RIGHT to (3,3).

Is that safe? Let's check body cells. The current body doesn't have (3,3), so yes. Then after moving, the tail is removed. So new body would be [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ].

Then from (3,3), next possible moves could be RIGHT again towards apple.

But wait, let me think about the path.

We need to get to (5,1). So starting at (2,3):

If we move RIGHT to 3, then right to 4, then right to 5. That's three rights. Then down twice: from y=3 to y=1.

But wait, current head is at (2,3), moving right to (3,3). Then next moves can be right again, but I need to check if that path is blocked by the body.

Wait, after moving right to (3,3), the body cells are [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] and head is at (3,3). So from here, moving down would take us to (3,2), but that's not in the body yet. Wait, but the apple is at (5,1), so maybe we can move right twice and then down.

Wait, let me try to outline a possible path:

Move 1: RIGHT → (3,3)
Move 2: RIGHT → (4,3)
Move 3: RIGHT → (5,3)
Then need to go down from y=3 to y=1, which is two downs.

But wait, after each move, the body shifts. So let's see:

After Move 1: head at (3,3), body is [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ]

Move 2: RIGHT to (4,3). Now body becomes [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) ]?

Wait no. Because when you move without eating apple, the tail is removed. So after first move right, the new body would be [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ], because we add head to front and remove last element.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Each time you make a move without eating an apple, the tail is removed. So initial body after first move would be previous body minus the last cell plus new head.

Wait no: when moving, the snake's head moves in direction, then each body part follows the next one. The tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

So for example, if the snake is at (2,3) and moves right to (3,3), the body becomes [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] because we add (3,3) as new head and remove (2,4).

Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: The snake's body is a list of cells excluding the head. So when you move, the head moves, then each body cell follows the next one, and if not eating, tail is removed.

So for example, initial body is [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ]

After moving RIGHT to (3,3):

- New head is (3,3)
- The new body would be [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)], because the tail (2,4) is removed.

So now, the snake's body is [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ]

Then from (3,3), if we move RIGHT again to (4,3):

- New head is (4,3)
- Body becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]

Wait no, because when you add the new head and remove the tail. So previous body after first move was [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ]

After moving to (4,3), the new body is [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)].

Then, from (4,3), move RIGHT to (5,3):

- Head at (5,3)
- Body becomes [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ]

Wait, but now the body is shorter. Then we need to go down twice.

From (5,3), next move could be DOWN to (5,2). Is that safe? The body is [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ], which doesn't include (5,2). So yes.

Then from (5,2), move DOWN again to (5,1), where the apple is. Then eat the apple, and body grows by one segment, so tail isn't removed after this move.

So let's outline the moves:

Move 1: RIGHT → (3,3)
Move 2: RIGHT → (4,3)
Move 3: RIGHT → (5,3)
Move 4: DOWN → (5,2)
Move 5: DOWN → (5,1) [eats apple]

Now, check constraints:

- Number of RIGHT moves: 3
- LEFT moves: 0 → so 3 - 0 = 3 → which matches x2 - x1 = 5 - 2 = 3.
- DOWN moves: 2
- UP moves: 0 → 2 - 0 = 2, which matches y1 - y2 = 3 -1=2.

So this satisfies the final position check.

But wait, after eating the apple at move 5, we need to ensure that there's at least one legal move afterward. Because when you eat an apple, the tail isn't removed, so the body is longer by one segment.

Wait no: according to rule 4, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment (tail doesn't shrink on next move). So in this case, after move 5, the head is at (5,1), and since we ate the apple, the tail remains. So the body now would include all previous cells plus the new head.

But for our path, we only need to reach the apple; the problem doesn't require checking beyond that.

Wait no: the problem says after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move. Because if you eat the apple and then can't move anymore, it's a trap.

So after moving to (5,1), which is the apple, we need to make sure that from there, there's at least one possible direction to move without collision.

But wait, in our case, after eating the apple, the next move would be move 6. But since the problem only requires us to reach the apple, maybe it's sufficient as long as we don't die upon eating.

Wait no: according to constraints, after eating, ensure there's at least one legal move afterward.

So let me check that after reaching (5,1), whether any direction is possible without colliding with body or going out of bounds.

After move 5:

- Head is at (5,1)
- Body cells are [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] plus the previous moves. Wait no: when you eat the apple, the tail isn't removed. So after move 5, the body would be the previous body before eating, which was [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ], but actually, I think that's not correct.

Wait, let me clarify:

When moving, each step adds the new head and removes the tail unless you eat an apple. So after move 1: RIGHT to (3,3). Body becomes [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] minus the last cell (2,4), but wait no.

Wait I'm getting confused again. Let's model each step:

Initial state:
Head: (2,3)
Body: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]

Move 1: RIGHT → (3,3). Since not eating apple, tail is removed.

New body after move 1: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] because we add new head (3,3) and remove last cell (2,4).

So the snake's body becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)].

Move 2: RIGHT → (4,3). Tail removed again. New body: [ (3,5), (3,4) ] plus new head? Wait no:

Wait, when moving to (4,3), the previous body was [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. So after adding new head (4,3), we remove the last cell (3,4). So body becomes [ (3,6), (3,5) ].

Wait, no: each move appends the new head and removes the last element unless eating. So:

Move 1:
Head: (3,3)
Body: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)] → because we added (3,3) and removed (2,4).

Move 2:
Head: (4,3)
Body: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] → because we add (4,3) and remove (3,4)?

Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think of it as the body follows the head.

Each time you move, the head moves, and each segment moves to the position of the previous one.

So for example:

Initial:
Head: H at (2,3)
Body segments: A(2,6), B(3,6), C(3,5), D(3,4), E(2,4)

After moving RIGHT to (3,3):
New head: H' = (3,3)
Segments move: A moves to where B was, etc., and last segment is removed.

So new body:
A'(3,6), B'(3,5), C'(3,4), D'(2,4) → wait no. No, when moving right, all segments follow the head.

Wait I'm getting stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to realize that each move shifts the body parts forward and removes the last one unless an apple is eaten.

So:

After Move 1 (RIGHT):
Head: (3,3)
Body: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] → because we added new head and removed E(2,4).

Move 2 (RIGHT to 4,3):
Head: (4,3)
Body: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] → added new head, removed last segment.

Wait no, the body should have each previous segment shifted. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let's think of the snake as a list where each part follows the next. So initial:

H(2,3) ← A(2,6) ← B(3,6) ← C(3,5) ← D(3,4) ← E(2,4)

After moving right to H'(3,3):

A' is where H was: (2,3)
But no, that's not correct. Each segment follows the previous one.

Wait, perhaps each time you move, the head moves, and each body part takes the position of the previous part. So:

Move RIGHT from H(2,3) → H'(3,3)

Then A(2,6) moves to where H was: (2,3). Wait no, that can't be right because then A would be at (2,3), which is not adjacent.

Wait I'm really confused here. Maybe it's better to model the body as a list, and each move shifts all elements except head.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just assume that after moving, the body parts are the previous ones minus the tail, unless eating an apple.

So for our path:

Move 1: RIGHT → (3,3). Body becomes [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] → removed E(2,4).

Move 2: RIGHT → (4,3). Body becomes [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ].

Move 3: RIGHT → (5,3). Body becomes [ (3,5), (3,4) ].

Wait that can't be right because the body is getting shorter each time, but in reality, when you move, the head moves and each body part follows. So perhaps after three rights, the body would have:

After move 1: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]
After move 2: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]
After move 3: [(3,5), (3,4)]

Then move down to (5,2):

Move 4: DOWN → (5,2). Body becomes [ (3,5), (3,4) ] minus last segment? Wait no.

Wait, perhaps each time you move, the head moves and all body parts shift forward. So after move 4, which is down from (5,3) to (5,2):

Body would be:

From previous state: [(3,5), (3,4)]

After moving down, new head is (5,2). Then each body part follows.

Wait this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should instead think that after the apple is eaten at move 5, the snake's body includes all segments up to the new position without removing anything.

So after eating the apple:

Head: (5,1)
Body: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (5,3), (5,2)]

Wait no, because when moving, each time you add the head and remove the tail unless eating.

After move 5, since we ate the apple, the body would have an extra segment. So from move 4:

Move 4: DOWN → (5,2). Since not eating, body becomes [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] minus last segment?

Wait I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the path and see if after moving to (5,1), any direction is possible without collision.

After reaching (5,1):

- Head is at (5,1)
- Body segments are [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] plus previous moves?

Wait no. Let's model each step:

Initial state:
Head: (2,3)
Body: [B(2,6), C(3,6), D(3,5), E(3,4), F(2,4)]

Move 1: RIGHT → Head at (3,3). Body becomes [C', D', E', F'] where each follows the head.

Wait no. Actually, when moving right:

Each body part takes the position of the previous one.

So after move 1:

Head is at (3,3).

Body parts:
B moves to (2,3) → but that's not adjacent to C which was at (3,6). Hmm, this seems impossible because B can't be at (2,3) if moving right from (2,3) to (3,3).

Wait I think the way it works is that each body part follows the head. So when you move right:

- Head goes to (3,3)
- The previous first segment (2,6) becomes next to the head? No.

Wait perhaps the body parts follow in order, so after moving, the new positions are:

Head: (3,3)

Body:
A → (2,6) follows B's old position?

No, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Another idea: since our initial plan seems to work except perhaps for ensuring that after eating the apple there's a move left, but in reality, once we're at (5,1), possible moves are:

- UP: Can't go up because y=0 is invalid.
- DOWN: From (5,1), down would be y=2, which is allowed as long as it's not blocked by body. After eating the apple, the body includes all previous segments plus (5,1). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe our initial path is correct, and after reaching (5,1), we can move left or up or right or down, but need to check for collisions.

Wait, from (5,1):

Possible directions:

- UP: y=0 invalid
- DOWN: (5,2). Is this position in the body? After eating, body is [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (5,3), (5,2) ] because we ate the apple at (5,1).

Wait no, after eating, the tail isn't removed. So body includes all previous segments plus new head.

So from move 5:

Head: (5,1)
Body: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (5,3), (5,2) ]

Because each time we moved, except for the last one which ate apple, tail was removed.

Wait no. After eating the apple at move 5, the tail isn't removed. So body is [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (5,3), (5,2) ] plus new head (5,1). Wait that would make it a very long snake.

Actually, no: when you eat the apple, you add a segment to the snake. So after move 5:

Head: (5,1)
Body: previous body before eating was [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (5,3), (5,2) ]

But wait, how did we get there? Because each move added head and removed tail unless apple was eaten.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that after the fifth move, when we eat the apple, the body becomes:

Body: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (5,3), (5,2) ]

Because each move except the last added head and removed tail.

So from (5,1):

Looking for possible moves without collision with body segments.

Possible directions:

- LEFT to (4,1): is this in the body? The body includes (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (5,3), (5,2). So (4,1) is clear.
- DOWN: y=0 invalid
- RIGHT: x=6; no issue but probably not needed.
- UP: invalid.

So from (5,1), moving LEFT to (4,1) is possible and doesn't hit any body segments. Therefore, after eating the apple, we can move left.

Thus, our initial path seems valid.

Therefore, the shortest path is 5 moves right, then down twice? Wait no, let's recount:

Wait in our plan, it's three rights to (5,3), then two downs to (5,1). That's a total of five moves. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe moving diagonally isn't allowed; we can only move up, down, left, right one square at a time.

So the path would be:

(2,3) → RIGHT to (3,3)

→ RIGHT to (4,3)

→ RIGHT to (5,3)

→ DOWN to (5,2)

→ DOWN to (5,1)

That's five moves. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, perhaps moving down first and then right could be shorter.

From (2,3):

Move DOWN to (2,2)

Then right thrice: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)

Then DOWN to (5,1). That's 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 moves as well.

So same number of moves. So the minimum is five moves.

But perhaps there's a way to do it in four moves? Let's see:

From (2,3), can we reach (5,1) in four moves?

Yes! If we move right twice and down twice diagonally? Wait no, movement is only orthogonal.

Wait wait, maybe not. Because from (2,3):

Move RIGHT to (3,3)

→ DOWN to (3,2)

→ RIGHT to (4,2)

→ DOWN to (4,1)

Then RIGHT to (5,1). That's five moves as well.

Alternatively:

From (2,3) → RIGHT → RIGHT → RIGHT → DOWN → DOWN. Still five moves.

Wait maybe we can do it in four moves? Let me think differently.

Is there a way to move right three times and down twice without needing to go step by step?

No, because each move is only one square. So total displacement is 3 right and 2 down, which requires at least 5 moves (since you can't move diagonally). Therefore, the minimal number of moves is five.

Wait but wait: displacement is 3 right and 2 down, so minimum moves are indeed 5 because you have to make each move in one direction at a time.

So the answer should be \boxed{5}
</think>

The problem requires finding the shortest path from the starting point (2, 3) to the goal (5, 1) on a grid. The movement is restricted to up, down, left, and right directions, one square at a time.

1. **Identify the displacement**:
   - From (2, 3) to (5, 1), we need to move 3 squares to the right and 2 squares downward.
   
2. **Determine the minimal moves**:
   - Each move can only change one coordinate by 1 unit.
   - Therefore, moving right 3 times and down 2 times is necessary.

3. **Calculate the total moves**:
   - The displacement requires a total of 3 + 2 = 5 moves.

Thus, the shortest path from (2, 3) to (5, 1) consists of 5 moves.

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
