========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to move the snake from (7,6) to eat the apple at (7,5). The current direction is "UP", and the body cells are [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]. Hmm, that's interesting because the head is at (7,6), and the first body cell is right below it at (7,5), which is also where the apple is.

Wait a minute, so if I move directly down from (7,6) to (7,5), that would be "DOWN". But wait, the current direction is "UP", so the next move can't be "DOWN" because you can't reverse direction. So moving "DOWN" right away isn't allowed.

So what other options do I have? The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, and UP since DOWN is blocked by the tail or body. Let me see: if I go LEFT from (7,6), that would take me to (6,6). But then, after moving, the body would shift. Since the apple is at (7,5), maybe I can plan a path that leads me there without colliding.

Wait, but the apple is directly below the head, and the first body cell is also at (7,5). So if I move "DOWN" towards the apple, I might be moving into the body's next position. Because in the movement update rules, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move. But currently, the body cells start with (7,5), which is right below the head.

So, if the current direction is "UP", the snake is moving upwards. The head is at (7,6), and the next body cell is (7,5). So the snake's body goes down from there.

If I try to move "DOWN" now, that would take me into (7,5), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. But according to the collision rules, if new_head coincides with any BODYi except when the tail moves, it's a collision. Since the next move doesn't involve eating an apple (unless I move into it), moving "DOWN" would cause a collision because the head would be on (7,5), which is part of the body.

Therefore, moving "DOWN" directly towards the apple isn't possible on the first step. So what else can I do? Maybe I should change direction to the left or right and then move down after that.

Looking at the current position: head is (7,6). Moving LEFT would take me to (6,6), which seems safe because it's not part of the body segments. Then, from there, perhaps I can plan a path towards the apple.

But wait, after moving LEFT, the next move could be DOWN or something else. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT first and then DOWN? Let me think about that.

If I move "RIGHT" to (8,6), but wait, the body cells are [(7,5), (8,5), ...], so the cell (8,5) is part of the body. From (8,6), if I move down, it would take me to (8,5), which is occupied by a body segment. So that's not safe.

Alternatively, moving "UP" from (7,6) would take me to (7,7), but I don't know where the apple is in relation to that, and maybe it's further away.

Hmm, this seems tricky. The problem is that the apple is right below the head, which is currently blocked by the first body segment. So to get there, I need to move around the body somehow.

Wait, perhaps I can make a U-turn? But no, because you can't reverse direction immediately. Since current direction is "UP", next move can't be "DOWN".

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT or RIGHT and then moving DOWN when possible.

Let me consider moving LEFT first: head moves to (6,6). Then, in the next step, I could choose a direction that allows me to move towards (7,5) without colliding.

But after moving LEFT, the body cells would update. The old head (7,6) becomes part of the body, so the new body list starts with (7,6), followed by (7,5), etc. So now, from (6,6), I can't move back to (7,6) because that's part of the body.

Wait, but if after moving LEFT, I want to get to (7,5), which is still part of the body. Hmm, maybe another move is needed.

Alternatively, maybe move RIGHT first? Let's see: from (7,6), moving RIGHT would take me to (8,6). Then, check for collisions: is (8,6) part of any current body segments? The body cells are [(7,5), (8,5), ...], so no. So it's safe.

After moving to (8,6), the next step could be DOWN towards (8,5), which is currently a body segment but might not be after movement.

Wait, let me think about this:

Current state:
Head: (7,6)
Body cells: [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]

If I move RIGHT to (8,6), then the new head is (8,6). Then, in step 2, perhaps moving DOWN to (8,5). But wait, when I'm at (8,6) and moving DOWN, new_head would be (8,5).

But let's check collisions: the body cells after the first move (after moving RIGHT) would be:

Old head is now part of the body. So the new body list starts with (7,6), followed by previous body cells shifted.

Wait no, according to the movement rules, when you move normally, you insert the old head at the front of the body list and then remove the tail unless eating an apple.

So after moving RIGHT:

- New head is (8,6)
- Insert old head (7,6) into body list: [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), ...]
- Since new_head is not equal to apple position (which is at (7,5)), we remove the tail. So the body becomes [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]

Now, in step 2: moving DOWN from (8,6) to (8,5). But (8,5) is part of the new body list as the third element. So that would be a collision because the head would move into a BODYi.

Therefore, moving DOWN after RIGHT isn't allowed because it causes a collision with the body segment at (8,5).

Hmm, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, what if I move LEFT first to (6,6), then try to move DOWN. Let's see:

After moving LEFT to (6,6):

- New head: (6,6)
- Insert old head (7,6) into body list: [(7,6), (7,5), ...]
- Since new_head is not apple, remove tail: body becomes [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Now, can I move DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5)?

Check if (6,5) is part of any body segments. The current body after first move is [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), ...]. So no, (6,5) isn't occupied. Then moving DOWN would be safe.

So the head moves to (6,5). Now, check if that's the apple position? No, because apple is at (7,5).

Then, next step: from (6,5), what direction can I take?

Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN, but considering current direction was "LEFT", so next move can't be "RIGHT".

Wait no, wait. The initial direction is "UP", then first move is LEFT, which is allowed because you can choose any direction except the reverse.

After moving LEFT, the new direction becomes "LEFT". So in the next step, I can't choose "RIGHT" again.

Hmm, this might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving to (6,5), I could move RIGHT back towards (7,5). But that would require another change of direction.

Wait, but let's think: after two moves, from (7,6) -> LEFT to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5).

Now, from (6,5), can I move RIGHT to (7,5)?

Yes, because the apple is at (7,5). Let me check for collisions:

After moving RIGHT from (6,5):

- New head: (7,5)
- Check body segments after first two moves. The body list would be [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), ...]. Wait no, let's track this step by step.

Wait, initial state:

Head: (7,6)

Body cells: [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]

First move: LEFT to (6,6). Then body becomes [(7,6)] + original body without the tail. Wait, no.

Wait, after moving LEFT:

- New head is (6,6)
- Insert old head into body: [(7,6)]
- Original body was [(7,5), (8,5), ...]
- So new body list is [old_head] + body[:-1], since we're not eating apple.

So body becomes [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Because original body was length 6, and after inserting old head, it's now 7 elements. Then remove the tail, so it's back to 6: [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].

Wait no, original body was [ (7,5), (8,5), ... ], length 6. After inserting old head, it's now [ (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1) ].

Then remove tail if not eating apple. Since new_head is (6,6), which isn't the apple position (7,5). So body becomes [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].

So after first move: head at (6,6), body as above.

Second move: DOWN to (6,5).

Now, check if (6,5) is in the new body list. The body list after second move would be:

After moving DOWN from (6,6):

- New head: (6,5)
- Insert old head (6,6) into body list: [(7,6), (7,5), ...] becomes [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]
- Then remove tail since not eating apple. So new body is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)].

So now, from (6,5), moving RIGHT to (7,5) would be possible? Let's see:

New head: (7,5). Is this part of the body list?

The new body is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), ...]. Wait, no. The new body after inserting old head and removing tail is:

After moving DOWN from (6,6):

Body becomes [(6,6)] + previous body[:-1]. Previous body was [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)], so new body is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)].

Wait no, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to track each step carefully.

Initial state:

- Head: (7,6)
- Body: [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]
- Direction: UP

First move: LEFT to (6,6)

After moving LEFT:

- New head: (6,6)
- Insert old head into body list: [(7,6)] + previous body[:-1] because we're not eating apple. Previous body was 6 elements; inserting makes it 7, then remove tail to keep it at 6.

So new body is [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]

Second move: DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5)

After moving DOWN:

- New head: (6,5)
- Insert old head (6,6) into body list: [(6,6)] + previous body[:-1]. Previous body was 6 elements; inserting makes it 7, then remove tail.

So new body is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Now, can I move RIGHT from (6,5) to (7,5)?

Yes, because the apple is at (7,5). Let's check collision:

- New head: (7,5)
- Is (7,5) in the body list? The current body after second move is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), ...]. Wait no, the new body is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)].

Wait, so (7,5) is part of the body. So moving to (7,5) would cause a collision because the head would be on (7,5), which is part of the body.

Hmm, that's a problem. So I can't move directly into (7,5) from (6,5) because it's occupied by a body segment.

So what other options are there? Maybe moving further down or up?

Wait, maybe after two moves, I should think of another path. Alternatively, perhaps trying to go around the other side.

Alternatively, instead of moving LEFT first, maybe move RIGHT and then DOWN in a way that avoids collision.

Wait, but earlier when I considered moving RIGHT to (8,6), then trying to move DOWN would take me to (8,5), which is part of the body after movement. So that's also blocked.

Hmm, this seems challenging. Maybe another approach is needed.

What if I move UP first? From (7,6) to (7,7). Then, from there, perhaps I can maneuver around.

But moving UP: new head at (7,7), which isn't part of the body.

Then, in step 2, maybe move RIGHT or LEFT.

Wait, but let's think about this:

After first move: HEAD is at (7,7)

Body list becomes [(7,6)] + original body[:-1] = [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]

So after moving UP, the new head is (7,7). Now, can I move RIGHT to (8,7)?

But (8,7) isn't part of any body segments. Then, from there, perhaps move DOWN towards (8,5).

Wait, let's track:

After second move: RIGHT to (8,7)

Body becomes [(7,7)] + previous body[:-1] = [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Now, can I move DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6)?

But (8,6) is not part of the current body segments. So that's safe.

Then, moving down further: step 3, move DOWN to (8,5).

After moving to (8,5):

- New head is (8,5)
- Insert old head (8,6) into body list: [(8,6), (7,7), (7,6), ...]
Wait no, the body after previous moves was [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

After moving DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6):

Body becomes [(8,7)] + previous body[:-1] = [(8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4)]

Now, can I move DOWN again to (8,5)? But that's part of the body.

So that's a collision. Therefore, moving down from (8,6) isn't allowed.

This seems like a dead end as well.

Hmm, maybe trying a different approach: moving in circles?

Alternatively, perhaps making three moves: first LEFT, then DOWN, then RIGHT, but I'm not sure if that would work.

Wait, let me try:

Move 1: LEFT to (6,6)

Body becomes [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]

Move 2: DOWN to (6,5). Now, body is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Now, from (6,5), move RIGHT to (7,5). But as before, that's part of the body.

Alternatively, from (6,5), move UP to (6,6), but that's where I came from and would be blocked by the body.

Hmm, perhaps moving LEFT again?

From (6,5), move LEFT to (5,5). Then, check if that's safe. The current body after two moves is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), ...]. So (5,5) isn't part of the body.

Then, from (5,5), perhaps I can find a way to get back towards the apple, but this seems like it's getting further away.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP after LEFT and DOWN?

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to visualize the grid:

Current head: (7,6)
Body cells: [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]
Apple is at (7,5)

So, the snake's body is moving down from (7,5) to (8,5), etc.

Wait a minute! The apple is right in front of the head. So maybe I can eat it by moving directly into it.

But wait, no: because when the head is at (7,6), and the next cell in the body is (7,5). If the apple is at (7,5), which is exactly where the snake's next segment is.

So if I move DOWN to (7,5), will that cause a collision with my own body?

Yes. Because after moving, the head would be at (7,5), and that cell is already occupied by part of the body.

Therefore, it's not possible to eat the apple in this case because doing so would result in a collision.

Hmm, perhaps I need to rearrange the snake's body to free up (7,5). But how?

Alternatively, maybe the snake can move into another position where the apple is accessible.

Wait, perhaps moving in a way that shifts the body segments out of the way.

Let me think:

If I move LEFT first, then the body will shift left as well. Then, after some moves, perhaps (7,5) becomes free.

But this might take several steps.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to make the snake turn so that it can approach the apple from another side.

Wait, let me consider all possible directions:

From (7,6), possible moves are LEFT (to 6,6), RIGHT (8,6), UP (7,7), or DOWN (7,5).

But moving DOWN would lead to a collision with body segment at (7,5). So that's not allowed.

So, the only initial options are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

Let me try moving RIGHT first:

Move 1: RIGHT to (8,6)

Body becomes [(8,6), (7,6), (7,5), ...] ?

Wait no. After moving right, the new head is at (8,6). The body segments shift accordingly.

Original body was [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)].

After moving RIGHT to (8,6):

- New head: (8,6)
- Insert old head into body: [(7,6)] + previous body[:-1]

Wait no. When the snake moves, each segment follows the previous one. So after moving right, the body becomes:

[ (8,6), (7,5), (8,5), ... ] ?

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

When the snake is at head (7,6) and body [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)], moving right would add (8,6) as new head, and shift each segment to the previous position.

So the new body would be:

- Head: (8,6)
- Next segments: (7,5), then (8,5), etc., up to the last segment which is removed if not eating apple.

Wait, no. Actually, when moving, all segments follow the head. So after moving right, each segment takes the position of the previous one.

So initial body:

[ (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1) ]

After moving right from (7,6) to (8,6):

- New head: (8,6)
- The next segment is now (7,6) [old head], then the rest follows.

So new body becomes:

[ (8,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) ]

Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Each segment should follow the path of the previous segments.

Actually, when you move right, each part of the body follows the previous part. So:

Original positions: head at (7,6), then next is (7,5), then (8,5), etc.

After moving right, new head is (8,6). Then the next segment is where the head was, which is (7,6). Then the rest follows as before.

So body becomes:

[ (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

Because each segment shifts to follow the previous one. The last segment is removed if not eating.

Wait, but we're not eating here because moving right didn't take us to the apple.

So after first move: head at (8,6), body is [ (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

Now, can I make a move that allows me to reach (7,5)?

Perhaps moving LEFT from (8,6) back to (7,6). But then the body would follow.

Wait, let's try:

Move 2: LEFT to (7,6)

Body becomes:

- New head: (7,6)
- Next segments: (8,6), then (7,5), etc.

So body after second move is [ (7,6), (8,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4) ]

Wait no. The original body after first move was [ (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ].

After moving LEFT back to (7,6):

- New head: (7,6)
- Next segments: (8,6) [old head], then (7,5), etc.

So body becomes:

[ (7,6), (8,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

But wait, the length is still 6. After inserting new head, it's 7 elements; then remove tail if not eating. Since we're moving left but not eating apple, body becomes [ (7,6), (8,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

Now, from (7,6), can I move DOWN to (7,5)?

Yes! Because after the second move, the body is:

[ (7,6), (8,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

So moving DOWN from (7,6) would take me to (7,5), which is currently the third segment in the body.

Wait, no. After second move, the body is [ (7,6), (8,6), (7,5), ... ].

So when I move DOWN to (7,5):

- New head: (7,5)
- Insert old head into body list: [(7,5)] + previous body[:-1]

Wait no. Each movement shifts the entire body.

Actually, after moving down from (7,6) to (7,5), the new positions would be:

- Head: (7,5)
- Next segment: (7,6) [old head]
- Then (8,6), then (7,5), etc.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps the answer is that it's not possible to eat the apple in this configuration because moving into the apple would cause a collision with the body. Therefore, the snake cannot eat the apple right now.

But the question seems to suggest that we should provide an action sequence to eat the apple. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to move in such a way that the body segment at (7,5) moves away before moving into it.

Let me think about making some moves that shift the body so that (7,5) is no longer occupied when I need to eat the apple.

For example:

1. Move RIGHT from (7,6) to (8,6). Now, body segments are [ (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), ... ]

2. Then move DOWN from (8,6) to (8,5). Body shifts accordingly.

3. Then move LEFT from (8,5) to (7,5), which is the apple's position.

But wait, after step 1:

- Head at (8,6)
- Body: [ (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) ]

After step 2: move DOWN to (8,5)

- New head at (8,5)
- Body becomes [ (8,5), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), ... ] Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Move LEFT from (7,6) to (6,6)

2. Move DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5)

3. Move RIGHT from (6,5) to (7,5), which is the apple.

But earlier analysis suggested that moving to (7,5) would be blocked by body segment.

Wait, let's track it step by step:

Step 1: LEFT to (6,6). Body becomes [ (6,6), (7,5), (8,5), ... ]

Step 2: DOWN to (6,5). Now head is at (6,5). Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (8,5), ... ]

Step 3: RIGHT to (7,5). So moving right from (6,5) to (7,5).

Now, check if (7,5) is part of the body.

After step 2:

- The body segments are [ (6,6), (7,5), (8,5), ... ]

Wait no. Each movement shifts all segments.

Actually, after moving down to (6,5):

The body would be:

[ (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (8,5), ... ]

So when I move right from (6,5) to (7,5), the new head is at (7,5). But in this case, is (7,5) already occupied by a body segment?

Yes, because after step 2, the second segment is (6,6), third is (7,5), etc.

So when moving right into (7,5), it's currently the third segment. Therefore, collision would occur.

Hence, this sequence doesn't work.

Alternative approach:

1. Move UP from (7,6) to (7,7)

2. Then move LEFT or RIGHT as needed to position the body such that (7,5) is free.

But I'm not sure if that's possible without making more moves.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a circle to shift the body segments away.

For example:

1. Move RIGHT from (7,6) to (8,6)

2. Move DOWN from (8,6) to (8,5)

3. Move LEFT from (8,5) to (7,5) - but that's the apple, but is it blocked?

After step 1:

Body: [ (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), ... ]

Step 2: move down to (8,5)

New body: [ (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), ... ]

Step 3: move left from (8,5) to (7,5). Now, check if (7,5) is in the body.

After step 2:

- Body segments after moving down are [ (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), ... ]

So when moving left into (7,5), which is currently the fourth segment. Therefore, collision occurs again.

Hmm, this seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps the only way to eat the apple is if the next body segment isn't there. So, maybe I need to create space by moving in a different direction first.

Another idea:

1. Move RIGHT from (7,6) to (8,6)

2. Then move RIGHT again to (9,6)

3. Now, the body has shifted, so perhaps moving back left would free up (7,5).

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, maybe it's impossible to eat the apple in this setup because the apple is right after the head, which is blocked by the body.

Therefore, the conclusion might be that the snake cannot eat the apple at this moment because doing so would result in a collision with its own body.
</think>

The snake cannot eat the apple at this time because moving into the apple's position would cause it to collide with its own body segment. Therefore, it is impossible to eat the apple right now.

**Answer:** It is not possible for the snake to eat the apple as doing so would result in a collision with its own body.
