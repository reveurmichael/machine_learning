========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the game state and plan a path for the snake to reach the apple.

Current head position: `(2,7)`
Current direction: `"LEFT"`
Body cells: `[(3,7), (4,7)]`
Apple position: `(7,7)`

The snake is currently moving left, but we can change direction as long as we don't reverse immediately. We need to move from `(2,7)` to `(7,7)`, which means we'll need to make 5 right moves and no vertical moves (since the y-coordinates are already aligned).

Let's plan a path:

1. Since the snake is moving left but needs to go right, we can start by moving up or down to avoid immediate collision with our body.
2. After that, we can continue moving right until we reach the apple.

I'll create the moves list and provide reasoning for this plan.

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Move up first to avoid body collision, then make 5 right moves to reach the apple."
}
```
