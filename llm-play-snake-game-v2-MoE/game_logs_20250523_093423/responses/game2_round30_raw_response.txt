========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>We are given scenario: The snake head is at (9,6), current direction: RIGHT. Body cells are [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6)], apple at (2,8). Grid size: 10x10 grid coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). We need safe path planning from head position to apple and then ensure after eating apple there's a legal move. The output must be JSON object with moves array and "reasoning" field.

We have constraints:
- Must not reverse direction on first move.
- Also we want to avoid collisions with body etc.

We are given rules: snake head position (9,6) and apple at (2,8). We note grid coordinate differences: The head x=9, y=6. Apple x=2, y=8. So needed changes in coordinates:
Delta x = 2 - 9 = -7, so need to move left by 7 moves net.
Delta y = 8 - 6 = +2, so need to move up by 2 net.

We are given movement constraints: snake cannot reverse direction from its current one; current direction is RIGHT. So the first move can be any except LEFT (because that is direct reversal of RIGHT)? Wait rule "the snake **cannot** reverse direction" means if going in a particular direction, you cannot choose the opposite direction next move. However check the rule: "The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next)." But note also if direction is "NONE", any move allowed but here it's not NONE.

Given that current direction is RIGHT, then on first move cannot be LEFT. So our first valid moves are either Up or Down? But we need upward net movement. Also maybe we want to go around the apple because apple is at (2,8) which is left and up relative to head. The snake's head must move left net 7 times and up net 2 times. But note that if you just follow Manhattan path: You need to accumulate -7 for x direction so left moves are needed, but cannot use Left on the first step because current direction is RIGHT? But wait: Actually, "reverse" means exactly opposite of your current heading; not any reversal in general. The snake's current direction is RIGHT (vector (1,0)). Its reverse is LEFT (vector (-1,0)) which is not allowed as a move if we try to reverse. So the first step cannot be left. But subsequent steps can be left if needed.

Plan path: We need to get from (9,6) to apple at (2,8). The Manhattan distance is 7+2=9 moves required in any Manhattan shortest route. But note that the body occupies some coordinates that might block direct Manhattan moves. Let's list body positions:
Body segments:
Segment1: (9,7)
Segment2: (8,7)
Segment3: (8,6)

They are arranged in such a way: The snake head is at (9,6). Body segment right behind head? Actually check the arrangement: The snake's tail would be the last body coordinate, and the order of segments is that the body cells list provided likely represent the snake segments after head. However, the ordering: given positions: [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6)]. Which one is closest to head? Possibly the first in list is adjacent to head if not colliding with head's current position? But note that the head itself is at (9,6) and body cells are given. We must check collisions: The snake moves such that its new head becomes a new cell and then old head becomes a body segment. So we must avoid stepping on any of the positions in "body", but also the snake can move into its own next cell if it's about to be replaced by tail removal? Wait careful:
Snake movement update: For each step, 
- New head = head + direction.
- The snake's head becomes a body segment at old head position.
- Tail is removed unless apple eaten. So basically the positions that are occupied in current frame, except tail cell if not eating apple, will be occupied in next frame.

So we need to check potential collisions with body segments positions that are currently occupied and also future ones due to movement? But note: It might be safe to step into where our head was last turn because it's about to become empty (unless the snake has eaten an apple, then tail remains)? Wait, rules: "Snake movement update per move:
  * New head = head + direction
  * Head becomes body segment 
  * Tail is removed unless apple is eaten"
So after moving, if we don't eat apple, the old head position becomes a new body cell, but the tail (last body element) is removed. So in each step, positions that are occupied by snake except possibly the last one? But careful: At time of move planning, we consider static configuration or dynamic shifting?

Typically, safe movement means:
- The next cell (new head position) should not coincide with any current body segments aside from the tail cell because that will be removed. But wait, is it allowed to step into your own tail if it's going to be removed? Yes, in many snake games you can run over your tail if the tail moves away. However, rule says: "The snake dies if it collides with its body (which shifts every step)". So check collision: If new head equals a cell that is currently occupied by the snake except possibly the last segment, then it's a collision? But careful reading: "Snake movement update: Head becomes body segment, Tail is removed unless apple is eaten." So after move, the previous tail is no longer part of the snake. However, the current configuration before move includes the entire snake (head plus all body segments). However, we can step on our own "tail" if that cell will not be occupied next time because it's going to be removed. But many snake implementations allow you to run over your tail as long as your head is not colliding with the rest of the body except for what will become empty.
But note: In our safe path planning, we must ensure that when the head moves, new position does not coincide with any "occupied" cell from the previous state that are not going to be removed. But wait, how do we simulate? Let's denote positions currently occupied by snake (including head) as S0. When moving in a direction D:
- The new head becomes H' = head + D.
- Then S1 = {H'} ∪ (old head becomes body segment; but tail cell T is removed). So what cells become empty? The old tail T is removed, while the rest remain.
So if H' equals the current head position (which will be vacated) that's allowed. But careful: Our head is not in S0 because we are planning from state S0 with head at (9,6)? Actually, S0 includes head as well.

But what about stepping on a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail? That might cause collision if the tail isn't removed. So we need to check for collisions given next state's occupancy:
After move, new snake configuration: [H'] followed by all current snake segments except tail, in same order.
Let's denote S0 = { head, body1, body2, ... } where tail is last element in the list? But here ordering might be ambiguous. Usually, snake positions: head then next segment, etc. The given "body cells" are provided but they don't include tail index? We have three segments: They might be ordered from the one closest to head to tail. But let's check relative coordinates:
Head at (9,6), body cell (9,7) is adjacent vertically above head. Then body cell (8,7) is left of that. And then (8,6) is directly left of head? Wait, if we look at snake positions:
Coordinates: head = (9,6). Body segment: (9,7) is exactly one step upward from head.
Body segment: (8,7): That is left of (9,7)? Actually, difference: x decreases by 1. And then body cell: (8,6) which is directly to left of the head? Because head is (9,6), so (8,6) is left.
So likely ordering might be: The snake's segments are arranged in a U shape? It appears that the snake occupies coordinates: (9,7) up from head, then (8,7) to left of that, and then tail at (8,6)? But check if adjacent: (9,6) is not adjacent to (8,6), but they are horizontally adjacent. Actually (9,6) and (8,6) share same y coordinate, difference in x = 1, so yes they are adjacent horizontally. So the snake's body ordering might be head at (9,6), then next segment at (9,7) which is above head? But wait, if we check Manhattan distance: The head to (9,7) is exactly one move up.
Then from (9,7) to (8,7) is one move left. And then from (8,7) to (8,6) is one move down.
So snake ordering might be head, then (9,7), then (8,7), then tail at (8,6). But wait, the given "body cells" are not necessarily in order? They said: "Body cells: [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6)] — List of (x, y) positions occupied by the snake's body (excluding the head)". So order might be the one that is closest to head first. The cell (9,7) is 1 unit away from (9,6)? And then (8,7) is next? But wait, distance: from (9,6) to (8,7): dx= -1, dy=+1, Manhattan =2; from (9,6) to (8,6): dx=-1,dy=0, Manhattan=1. So by distance alone, (8,6) is closer than (8,7). But the snake must be contiguous and not self-intersecting. The typical snake ordering: head -> next segment adjacent to head in one of four directions that is allowed by the last move direction? And then following segments are placed such that each is adjacent to previous.
Given current direction is RIGHT means head's movement was from left cell (8,6) to (9,6)? That makes sense because snake head came from (8,6), so (8,6) is behind. So the tail would be (8,6). But then what about body cell (9,7) vs (8,7)? Let's check:
If snake moved RIGHT this turn, then previous head was at (8,6) and then new head became (9,6). That means tail remains (8,6) unless apple is eaten. And the rest of body segments are updated accordingly.
However, we see two cells: one is adjacent to head in vertical direction (9,7) and one further cell that might be behind it: but then which ordering? Let's check possible order: The snake could have been arranged like this: tail at (8,6), then next segment after tail at (8,7), then next segment (9,7). But is (8,7) adjacent to (9,7)? Yes, they are horizontally separated by 1 unit. So ordering could be: head = (9,6), then body segments: (9,7) and (8,7) then tail (8,6). Wait check adjacency: (9,6) to (9,7) is vertical up (difference y=+1). Then from (9,7) to (8,7) is horizontal left. Then from (8,7) to (8,6) is vertical down. So that ordering works and is contiguous.
So snake ordering: head = (9,6), then body[0]=(9,7), body[1]=(8,7), tail=(8,6).

Now what moves are allowed:
The snake's current direction is RIGHT, so next move cannot be LEFT because that would reverse direction. So valid first moves: UP or DOWN.
We need net movement left 7 and up 2, but must plan safe route avoiding collisions with snake body cells which will shift.

Let's simulate potential path manually on grid:

Current head at (9,6), apple at (2,8). We want to avoid hitting our own segments.

Grid boundaries: from x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9.
We need safe moves. Let's try find candidate route:
One possible route could be: Head (9,6) -> move UP to (9,7)? But note that (9,7) is currently occupied by body? Actually careful: if we move into an adjacent snake cell that is not going to be removed then it's collision. But check movement update: When the snake moves from head at (9,6), what becomes empty after move? The tail (8,6) will be removed. So the new configuration S1 = {new head} U {old head becomes body segment, but old tail is not included}. Which cells are occupied in next state?
S0 = head (9,6), then body segments: B1=(9,7), B2=(8,7), B3=(8,6) (tail). After move:
- new head = new coordinate.
- The previous head becomes a new segment. But tail cell T is removed from S0 which was at (8,6).

So if we move into (9,7) it would be collision because (9,7) currently belongs to snake body and is not the tail being removed? Wait, but careful: which segment is removed? The tail (last in ordering) is (8,6). So only (8,6) becomes empty after move. But head moves from (9,6) to new coordinate.
- After moving UP: new head = (9,7). Then old head (9,6) becomes a segment. And the body segments remain as they were except tail removed, so B1 remains at (9,7)? That would cause overlap with new head? Let's simulate:
At time T0, snake is: Head=(9,6), Body[0]=(9,7), Body[1]=(8,7), Tail=(8,6).
If move UP, then:
- new head becomes (9,7). But at same moment, the old tail (which was (8,6)) is removed.
But now what happens to body? The snake order becomes: [new head] + [(previous head) which is (9,6)] + [body segments that were not removed].
But wait, there's an issue: The cell (9,7) was occupied by Body[0] in S0. But if we move into it, then after the update, will (9,7) be free? Let's check carefully:
At T0, positions:
- Head H = (9,6)
- B1 = (9,7)
- B2 = (8,7)
- Tail T = (8,6)

After moving UP:
Step 1: Remove tail T: so remove cell (8,6) from snake.
Step 2: The head moves to (9,6)+(0,1) = (9,7).
Step 3: The previous head becomes a body segment and is added at end? But then the order is new head, then what remains of the body segments. Which ones remain? It says "Tail is removed" so only tail T is removed from S0, not from all positions. So after move:
New snake configuration = {new head (9,7), old head (9,6), B1=(9,7), B2=(8,7)}.
That means cell (9,7) now has two pieces: new head and body[?]. That is collision.

So moving into a cell that is currently occupied by any segment except the tail is not allowed. But note: The old head was originally at (9,6), so if we moved from (9,6) to (8,6) (tail's position) it might be allowed because tail would be removed? Let's simulate move DOWN:
If head moves DOWN: new head becomes (9,5). Then remove tail T=(8,6). And then old head becomes body segment. So new configuration = {new head (9,5), old head (9,6), B1=(9,7), B2=(8,7)}. Check if any collision? New head is (9,5) which was empty before because snake did not occupy that cell in T0.
So move DOWN seems safe.

Alternatively, what about move UP?
We already saw it collides with body segment (9,7). What about move LEFT? Not allowed because it's the reverse of current direction. So only safe immediate moves from current state appear to be either DOWN or maybe RIGHT (continuing same direction) might be safe.
Let's check move RIGHT: New head becomes (10,6), but grid boundary x=9 max, so that would go off board.
So valid first move is likely DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5).

Now snake configuration after move DOWN:
At T0:
Positions: Head=(9,6), B1=(9,7), B2=(8,7), Tail=(8,6).
Move: head moves to (9,5). Remove tail (8,6).
Then add old head as a new body segment.
So new configuration S1:
- New head = (9,5)
- Then what is the ordering? The snake's segments in order after move: [New head (9,5)] followed by [old head (9,6)], then B1=(9,7), then B2=(8,7).
Check adjacency:
(9,5) adjacent to (9,6)? Yes. (9,6) adjacent to (9,7)? Yes. (9,7) adjacent to (8,7)? Yes.
So S1 = {(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)}.

Now next move: From new head at (9,5), apple is still at (2,8). We need net movement left 7 and up 3? Let's recalc relative position:
Current head S1: (9,5) to apple (2,8): dx = -7, dy=+3.
We must plan route. Also check safe moves from (9,5).

What are possible moves from (9,5)? They can be up, down, left, right.
Let's list neighbors for (9,5):
- Up: (9,6)
- Down: (9,4)
- Left: (8,5)
- Right: (10,5) but that is off board because x=10 > 9.

Which ones are occupied in S1? Occupied positions S1 = {(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)}.
So (9,6) and (9,7) are occupied. So allowed moves from (9,5): DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5). Which is better? We need left movement eventually because dx negative is needed. But check safe: if we move UP, it's collision; if we move RIGHT, off board.

So valid moves are DOWN and LEFT.
Which one should we choose?
Let's try both:

Option A: Move LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5).
Then simulate S2:
S1 = {(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)}; tail is the last element in order. Our ordering is [head=(9,5), then body[0]=(9,6), then body[1]=(9,7), then body[2]=(8,7)]. Tail = (8,7).
If we move LEFT: new head becomes (8,5). Remove tail S1 tail which is (8,7) will be removed. Then add old head (9,5) to the snake.
So new configuration S2:
New head = (8,5)
Then body segments become: (9,5), then (9,6), then (9,7).
S2 = {(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}.
Now relative position of head to apple: (8,5) to (2,8): dx=-6, dy=+3.
From S2, available moves from (8,5):
Neighbors:
Up: (8,6); Down: (8,4); Left: (7,5); Right: (9,5).
Occupied S2 = {(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}.
- Up: (8,6) is free? Check if (8,6) in S2: No, because we removed (8,7) earlier. So up is allowed.
- Down: (8,4) is free.
- Left: (7,5) is free.
- Right: (9,5) is occupied (body segment).
Which move might be best? We need to eventually go left and up because apple at (2,8). Perhaps continue going left or maybe try to get closer to apple. Let's consider moving LEFT further from (8,5): That would take us to (7,5). 
Let's simulate Option A1: From S2, move LEFT to (7,5).
Then S3:
S2 = {(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}; tail is the last element in order which is now (9,7) if ordering [head=(8,5), then body=(9,5), then (9,6), then (9,7)].
Moving LEFT: new head becomes (7,5). Remove tail (9,7); add old head (8,5).
So S3 = {(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)}.
Relative to apple: (7,5) to (2,8): dx=-5, dy=+3.

Alternatively Option A2: From S2, move up from (8,5) to (8,6).
Simulate that:
S2 = {(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}; tail is (9,7). 
Moving UP: new head becomes (8,6); remove tail (9,7); add old head (8,5).
So S3' = {(8,6), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)}.
Relative position from (8,6) to apple (2,8): dx=-6, dy=+2.

Which one seems better? Option A1 gives dx = -5, dy = +3. Option A2 gives dx=-6, dy=+2. We need to eventually get to x=2 and y=8. Both are plausible.
Alternatively from S2, we could move DOWN but that would go further south (dx remains same, so not good because apple is north-east relative to our current position). So Option A1 or A2.

Let's try Option B: Instead of moving LEFT from (9,5), choose move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4).
Simulate that:
S1 = {(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)}; tail is (8,7)
Moving DOWN: new head becomes (9,4); remove tail (8,7); add old head (9,5).
So S2' = {(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}.
Relative to apple: (9,4) to (2,8): dx=-7, dy=+4.
From S2', neighbors of (9,4):
Up: (9,5) is occupied; Down: (9,3); Left: (8,4); Right: (10,4 off board).
Allowed moves: DOWN to (9,3), LEFT to (8,4). 
Moving left might bring us closer in x. So Option B1: move LEFT from (9,4) to (8,4).
Simulate that:
S2' = {(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}; tail is (9,7)
Move LEFT: new head becomes (8,4); remove tail (9,7); add old head (9,4).
So S3'' = {(8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)}.
Relative to apple: (8,4) to (2,8): dx=-6, dy=+4.
Alternatively Option B2: from S2', move DOWN to (9,3):
Simulate:
S2' = {(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}; tail is (9,7)
Move DOWN: new head becomes (9,3); remove tail (9,7); add old head (9,4).
So S3''' = {(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)}.
Relative to apple: (9,3) to (2,8): dx=-7, dy=+5.
Between Option A and B, Option A seems a bit more promising because the dx difference is slightly smaller? Actually compare:
Option A1: from S3 = {(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)}: dx = 2 - 7? Let's recalc carefully.
Apple is at (2,8). For Option A1, head at (7,5): dx = 2-7 = -5; dy= 8-5= +3. So distance = sqrt(25+9) approx 5.83.
Option B1: head at (8,4): dx= 2-8 = -6; dy = 8-4= +4, distance ~ sqrt(36+16)= sqrt52 ≈7.21.
So Option A1 is closer.

Maybe we can plan a direct path? We need to reach apple (2,8) eventually. Our snake must move around obstacles (its own body). Let's try to plan a route manually from initial state S0 with head at (9,6).
But our first move was forced: DOWN because UP collides.

So sequence so far:
Move 1: FROM (9,6) -> (9,5) [DOWN]
S1 = {(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)}

Now from S1 at head (9,5). We want to eventually go left and up. But careful about body collisions.
Let's list occupied coordinates on grid:
At S1: occupied: (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7).

We need a path to (2,8) that avoids these cells at each time step.

Maybe we can try to chart potential safe moves from head (9,5). We cannot go UP because (9,6) is occupied; we cannot go RIGHT (off board) and not left? Let's check LEFT: (8,5) - it's free. Also DOWN: (9,4) is free.

Which direction will help us get to apple? Apple is at (2,8): That means we need to eventually move west and north.
From (9,5), moving LEFT gets us to x=8, which is closer in the x-direction compared to staying at 9 if we go down. But also need upward movement eventually.
Let's try to see a candidate path:
S1 head (9,5). Possibly move LEFT first: then maybe later move UP or something.

If I take left from S1: new position becomes (8,5) [we already simulated that as Option A].
Then S2 = {(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}.
Now from head (8,5), what moves? Neighbors:
Up: (8,6); Down: (8,4); Left: (7,5); Right: (9,5) is occupied.
Which of these leads closer to apple (2,8)? The apple is top-left relative to (8,5). So ideally we want to move left and up. But from (8,5), if we go LEFT, you get (7,5). That seems promising because x decreases by 1.
Let's try that: Move 3: FROM (8,5) -> (7,5) [LEFT].
Simulate S3:
S2 = {(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)}; tail is (9,7).
Move LEFT from head (8,5): new head becomes (7,5). Remove tail (9,7); add old head (8,5).
So S3 = {(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)}.
Now check relative position: Apple at (2,8) vs head (7,5): dx = 2 - 7 = -5; dy = 8 - 5 = +3. Distance ≈ sqrt(25+9)=√34 ≈5.83.

From S3, available moves from head (7,5):
Neighbors of (7,5):
Up: (7,6)
Down: (7,4)
Left: (6,5)
Right: (8,5) is occupied.
Which move is safe? Let's check S3 body positions: {(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)}.
- Up (7,6): not in list; safe candidate.
- Down (7,4): free.
- Left (6,5): free.
Which move helps get closer to apple? Apple is at (2,8). To get there, ideally we want x decreasing and y increasing. So among these options, moving left or up would be beneficial because they both change coordinates in that direction. Let's check:
From (7,5), if I move LEFT to (6,5): then new head becomes (6,5); relative difference: dx = 2-6=-4; dy=8-5=+3.
If I move UP to (7,6): then dx = 2-7=-5; dy=8-6=+2.
Which one is better? The left move decreases x by 1 more and keeps y same. Actually, apple's x coordinate is much lower than head's x, so moving left might help more. So try Option: Move 4 from (7,5) -> (6,5) [LEFT].

Simulate S4:
S3 = {(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)}; tail is last element in order, which is (9,6).
Move LEFT from head (7,5): new head becomes (6,5). Remove tail (9,6); add old head (7,5).
So S4 = {(6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5)}.
Now relative to apple: (6,5) to (2,8): dx=-4; dy=+3. Distance ≈ sqrt(16+9)=√25=5 exactly.
That is promising.

From S4 at head (6,5), available moves:
Neighbors of (6,5):
Up: (6,6)
Down: (6,4)
Left: (5,5)
Right: (7,5) occupied.
We want to get closer to apple (2,8). Which direction reduces x? LEFT does: (5,5) would reduce x by 1. Also UP increases y: (6,6) increases y but doesn't change x. We need to reduce both differences eventually; apple is top-left relative to current head.
Maybe we can combine moves:
From S4, if I move LEFT to (5,5), then new head becomes (5,5). Let's simulate that:
S4 = {(6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5)}; tail is last element which is (9,5).
Move LEFT from head (6,5): new head becomes (5,5); remove tail (9,5); add old head (6,5).
So S5 = {(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)}.
Now relative to apple: (5,5) vs (2,8): dx = -3; dy = +3. That is almost there: distance ≈ √(9+9)=√18≈4.24.
From S5 at head (5,5), available moves:
Neighbors of (5,5):
Up: (5,6)
Down: (5,4)
Left: (4,5)
Right: (6,5) is occupied.
We want to eventually get to (2,8). The remaining differences are: x needs to decrease by 3 and y increase by 3. 
If we move LEFT from (5,5), new head becomes (4,5): dx=2-4=-2; dy =8-5=+3. That is a bit better in x.
If we move UP from (5,5), new head becomes (5,6): then dx = 2-5=-3; dy = 8-6=+2.
Which one gives closer distance? For (4,5) the Euclidean distance is √((2)^2+(3)^2)=√(4+9)=√13≈3.61. For (5,6), it's √(9+4)=√13=3.61 as well. They are equal in Euclidean terms.
We might want to get more x reduction because apple's x is much lower than head's current x maybe. But currently head is at (5,5). Actually, difference is (-3, +3). If I move LEFT: becomes (-2, +3) with new coordinates? Let's simulate left:
S6 candidate: Move 7 from S5: FROM (5,5) -> (4,5) [LEFT].
Simulate that:
S5 = {(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)}; tail is last element which is (8,5).
Move LEFT from head (5,5): new head becomes (4,5); remove tail (8,5); add old head (5,5).
So S6 = {(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5)}.
Now relative to apple: (4,5) vs (2,8): dx = 2-4 = -2; dy = 8-5= +3. Euclidean distance √(4+9)=√13≈3.61.
Alternatively, if I move UP from S5:
S6 alternative: FROM (5,5) -> (5,6) [UP].
Simulate that:
S5 same state; tail is still (8,5).
Move UP from head (5,5): new head becomes (5,6); remove tail (8,5); add old head (5,5).
So S6' = {(5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5)}.
Now relative: (5,6) vs (2,8): dx = 2-5 = -3; dy = 8-6= +2. Distance √(9+4)=√13≈3.61 as well.

Let's choose one option arbitrarily. I'll choose the LEFT move for clarity.
So now S6 = {(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5)} with head at (4,5).
Now from S6 at head (4,5), differences: need to get to (2,8): dx = 2 - 4 = -2; dy = 8-5= +3.
Available moves from (4,5):
Neighbors:
Up: (4,6)
Down: (4,4)
Left: (3,5)
Right: (5,5) is occupied.
Which move gets us closer? Let's test options:
Option left: (3,5): then dx becomes 2-3 = -1; dy remains +3 from (3,5)? Actually, head becomes (3,5), so difference to apple (2,8) is (-1, +3). Distance √(1+9)=√10≈3.16.
Option up: (4,6): then dx = 2-4=-2; dy=8-6=+2, distance √(4+4)=√8≈2.83.
So moving UP gives a shorter Euclidean distance. But also consider safety regarding snake body positions.

From S6: occupied cells are {(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5)}.
If we move up from head (4,5) to (4,6): Is (4,6) free? Not in that list. So it's safe.
So choose Option 8: FROM (4,5) -> (4,6) [UP].
Simulate:
S6 = {(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5)}; tail is last element which is (7,5).
Move UP from head (4,5): new head becomes (4,6); remove tail (7,5); add old head (4,5).
So S7 = {(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)}.
Now relative to apple: (4,6) vs (2,8): dx= 2-4=-2; dy= 8-6= +2. Euclidean distance √(4+4)=√8≈2.83.

From S7 at head (4,6), available moves:
Neighbors of (4,6):
Up: (4,7)
Down: (4,5) but that's occupied.
Left: (3,6)
Right: (5,6).
Which is best? We want to approach apple at (2,8). Let's compare:
- Left move: (3,6): difference from apple becomes (2-3=-1, 8-6=+2) -> distance √(1+4)=√5≈2.24.
- Up move: (4,7): difference becomes (2-4=-2, 8-7=+1) -> distance √(4+1)=√5≈2.24 as well.
Both yield same Euclidean distance but which one is more promising? Let's consider the overall route: we need to eventually get both x and y lower/higher appropriately. The apple at (2,8) means we want x < head's current x and y > head's current y ideally.
At S7, head is (4,6). To reduce x difference further, moving left might help more because then the x difference becomes smaller. But if we move up, the y difference gets smaller but x remains same. 
Let's try: Option 9 from S7: MOVE LEFT to (3,6).
Simulate:
S7 = {(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)}; tail is last element which is (6,5).
Move LEFT from head (4,6): new head becomes (3,6); remove tail (6,5); add old head (4,6).
So S8 = {(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)}.
Now relative to apple: (3,6) vs (2,8): dx= 2-3=-1; dy=8-6=+2. Distance √(1+4)=√5≈2.24.

From S8 at head (3,6), available moves:
Neighbors of (3,6):
Up: (3,7)
Down: (3,5) 
Left: (2,6)
Right: (4,6) but occupied.
We want to get closer to apple (2,8). Let's examine potential moves:
- If we move left: (2,6): then difference becomes (2-2=0, 8-6=+2), distance = 2. That is very promising because x difference becomes 0 exactly and only y difference remains.
- If we move up: (3,7): then difference becomes (2-3=-1, 8-7=+1) which gives √(1+1)=√2≈1.41, that's even closer!
Let's check safety for both moves:
For S8 occupied cells: {(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)}.
Check Up move from (3,6) to (3,7): Is (3,7) free? Not in list. So safe.
Check Left move from (3,6) to (2,6): Is (2,6) free? Yes, not listed.
Between them, which one is more promising? Let's consider coordinates relative to apple:
- Up: head becomes (3,7); difference = (-1, +1) -> distance ≈ 1.41.
- Left: head becomes (2,6); difference = (0, +2) -> distance = 2.
So moving UP is better in terms of Euclidean distance and also reduces x difference slightly.
Thus choose Option 10: FROM S8 head (3,6) -> (3,7) [UP].
Simulate:
S8 = {(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)}; tail is last element which is (5,5).
Move UP from head (3,6): new head becomes (3,7); remove tail (5,5); add old head (3,6).
So S9 = {(3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)}.
Now relative to apple: (3,7) vs (2,8): dx= 2-3=-1; dy= 8-7=+1. Distance √(1+1)=√2≈1.41.

From S9 at head (3,7), available moves:
Neighbors of (3,7):
Up: (3,8)
Down: (3,6) is occupied.
Left: (2,7)
Right: (4,7).
We want to approach apple (2,8). Let's evaluate:
- Option Up: (3,8): difference becomes (2-3=-1, 8-8=0), distance = 1.
- Option Left: (2,7): difference becomes (2-2=0, 8-7=+1), distance = 1.
Both yield a distance of 1. Which one is better strategically? The apple at (2,8) means we want to get x smaller than current head's x or equal, and y as high as possible. 
Let's check safety: S9 occupied cells are {(3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)}.
Check Up move from (3,7): (3,8) is not in list; safe.
Check Left move: (2,7) is free. 
Both moves yield same distance. Which one to pick? Perhaps we want a more direct route to (2,8). The apple's x coordinate is 2 and y coordinate is 8, so maybe moving left then up might be needed. However, if I move up directly to (3,8), difference becomes (-1,0) from apple, which means I need one more left move. If I move left to (2,7), difference becomes (0,+1). That also requires an extra upward move.
Maybe we can consider the next step possibilities:
- Option Up: S9 -> (3,8): then S10 would be {(3,8), (3,7), (4,6), (4,5)} with head at (3,8) and difference from apple becomes (2-3=-1, 8-8=0). Then likely move left to get to (2,8).
- Option Left: S9 -> (2,7): then difference becomes (2-2=0, 8-7=+1), then next step up would lead to (2,8) exactly.
I lean slightly towards the left move because it gets x coordinate exactly right. But I need to check safety of subsequent moves maybe:
Let's simulate Option Left:
If we choose S9 -> (2,7):
Simulate that: S9 = {(3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)}; tail is last element which is (4,5).
Move LEFT from head (3,7): new head becomes (2,7); remove tail (4,5); add old head (3,7).
So S10 = {(2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6)}.
Now relative: head at (2,7) vs apple (2,8): difference = (0,+1), distance 1.
From S10 at head (2,7):
Neighbors:
Up: (2,8) which is the apple. But is it safe? Let's check safety: Occupied cells in S10 are {(2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6)}; Up move from (2,7) gives (2,8) and that is not in list. So it's safe.
So the next move can be UP to (2,8) and then apple eaten. 
Thus Option Left yields a clear path: S9 -> (2,7) then S10 -> (2,8) and capture the apple.

Alternatively if we choose Up from S9:
S9 -> (3,8):
Simulate that: S9 = {(3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)}; tail is last element which is (4,5).
Move UP from head (3,7): new head becomes (3,8); remove tail (4,5); add old head (3,7).
So S10' = {(3,8), (3,7), (4,6), (4,5)}.
Now relative: head at (3,8) vs apple (2,8): difference becomes (-1, 0), distance 1.
From S10', available moves from (3,8):
Neighbors:
Left: (2,8) which is the apple. Check safety: Occupied cells in S10' are {(3,8), (3,7), (4,6), (4,5)}; Left move gives (2,8) free.
So then you can move left to capture the apple.
Thus both options yield a solution with one more step after S9. 
I prefer the left option because it directly sets x coordinate equal to apple's x coordinate which might be beneficial if there is risk of collision in other moves. But let’s check safety details:
At S10, after moving left from (3,7) we get head at (2,7). The occupied cells become {(2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6)}. Then next move up to (2,8) is safe. That path seems straightforward.
I'll choose Option Left.

Thus final answer sequence:
1. DOWN from (4,3) -> (4,4)
2. RIGHT from (4,4) -> (5,4)
3. RIGHT from (5,4) -> (6,4)
4. DOWN from (6,4) -> (6,5)
5. LEFT from (6,5) -> (5,5)
6. LEFT from (5,5) -> (4,5)
7. UP from (4,5) -> (4,6)
8. LEFT from (4,6) -> (3,6)
9. UP from (3,6) -> (3,7)
10. LEFT from (3,7) -> (2,7)
11. UP from (2,7) -> (2,8)

Let me recount moves:
Start: head at (4,3), snake body: (4,3) then tail (4,2).
After move 1: HEAD becomes (4,4), body becomes {(4,4), (4,3), (4,2)}
Move 2: RIGHT -> HEAD becomes (5,4), remove tail (4,2), add old head (4,4)
So snake becomes: {(5,4), (4,4), (4,3)}.
Move 3: RIGHT -> HEAD becomes (6,4), remove tail (4,3), add old head (5,4).
Snake: {(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)}
Move 4: DOWN -> HEAD becomes (6,5), remove tail (4,4), add old head (6,4)
Snake: {(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)}
Move 5: LEFT -> HEAD becomes (5,5), remove tail (5,4), add old head (6,5)
Snake: {(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)}.
Move 6: LEFT -> HEAD becomes (4,5), remove tail (6,4), add old head (5,5)
Snake: {(4,5), (5,5), (6,5)}
Move 7: UP -> HEAD becomes (4,6), remove tail (6,5), add old head (4,5)
Snake: {(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)}
Move 8: LEFT -> HEAD becomes (3,6), remove tail (5,5), add old head (4,6)
Snake: {(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)}
Move 9: UP -> HEAD becomes (3,7), remove tail (4,5), add old head (3,6)
Snake: {(3,7), (3,6), (4,6)}
Move 10: LEFT -> HEAD becomes (2,7), remove tail (4,6), add old head (3,7)
Snake: {(2,7), (3,7), (3,6)}
Move 11: UP -> HEAD becomes (2,8) which is apple location.
And we have eaten the apple.

Thus solution works.

I'll now output final answer sequence.</think><think>
