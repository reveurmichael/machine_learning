========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake eat the apple without dying. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (8,1), which is near the top-left part of the grid since y increases upwards. The direction is set to "DOWN", so the snake is currently moving downward. That might be important because if we change direction, we can't reverse immediately.

The body cells are [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)]. So looking at these positions, they form a vertical line starting from (8,2) behind the head and going down to (8,5). That means the snake is currently extending downward from the head.

The apple is located at (2,0), which is near the bottom-left corner of the grid. To get there from (8,1), the snake needs to move left several times and also a bit down or up, but since it's already at y=1, moving down further would take it towards y=0.

Now, I need to plan a path that allows the head to reach (2,0) without colliding with any body parts or going out of bounds. Also, I must ensure that after eating the apple, there's still space for the snake to move next turn.

Let me visualize the grid:

- The snake is at (8,1), and its body goes straight down.
- The apple is at (2,0), which is 6 units left in x-direction and 1 unit down in y from the head.

So, moving left multiple times seems necessary. But I have to make sure that each move doesn't cause the head to collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

Since the current direction is "DOWN", the next move can't be "UP". So the first move must be either LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but considering safety and the path towards the apple, moving LEFT seems logical.

Let me plan each step:

1. **First Move: LEFT** from (8,1) to (7,1). I need to check if this new head position is safe.
   - The body after the move would be [HEAD becomes (7,1), then the old head (8,1), followed by (8,2), etc.]. So the body parts are now [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)] but wait, no, after moving LEFT, the new head is at (7,1). The old head becomes part of the body.

Wait, actually, according to the movement rules:
- After computing new_head, we update the body by inserting the old head at the front. So if the direction is LEFT, and we move from (8,1) to (7,1), the body after this move would be [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)] but then since it's not eating an apple, the tail is removed. So the new body becomes [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)], because we remove the last element (8,5). 

Wait no, wait: Let me recheck.

Original S before move: Head is (8,1), Body cells are [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)].

After moving LEFT to (7,1):

- new_head = (7,1)
- Check collision: (7,1) must not be in the body except possibly where it's about to move. The body is [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)], so no collision.
- Update body:
   a. Insert old head (8,1) at front → body becomes [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)]
   b. Since new_head is not apple position, remove tail → body becomes [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]

So the new S is:
Head: (7,1)
Body: [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]

So that's safe.

Next move:

The direction is now LEFT, so I can choose any except RIGHT. But let me think about where to go next.

Current head at (7,1). The apple is at (2,0). So we need to keep moving left or down.

But the snake body is extending from (8,1) down to (8,4), which is on the same x=8 column. Moving further left could create a situation where the body wraps around and blocks itself.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first would allow more flexibility. Let's see:

From (7,1), possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT. Since we can't move UP because that would be reversing from previous direction (current direction is LEFT; no, actually, previous direction was DOWN, now it's LEFT after the first move). Wait, the current direction after moving LEFT becomes "LEFT", so next move cannot be RIGHT.

Wait, movement rules say you can't reverse. So if current direction is "LEFT", you can't choose "RIGHT" next.

So from (7,1), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, but not RIGHT.

Hmm. Let me think about the path:

We need to get to (2,0). That's 6 steps left and 1 step down from current head position. So perhaps moving left several times, then down when needed.

But let's check for each possible move whether it's safe.

Second move: Let's try LEFT again.

Move from (7,1) to (6,1).

Check collision:
Body after first move is [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)].
So new_head is (6,1). Does this collide with any body part except possibly the tail? The body parts are at x=8 and y varying. So no collision.

Update body:
Insert old head (7,1) → body becomes [(7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]
Then remove tail (8,4) since not eating apple → body is [(7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)]

So new S:
Head: (6,1)
Body: [(7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)]

That's safe.

Third move: LEFT again to (5,1).

Check collision: body is [(7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)]. New head at (5,1) doesn't collide with any of these except possibly the tail which is moving. So it's safe.

Update body:
Insert old head (6,1) → [(6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)]
Remove tail (8,3) → body becomes [(6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)]

So far, so good.

Fourth move: LEFT to (4,1).

Collision check: same logic. New head is at (4,1). Body is [(6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)]. No collision except the tail moving. Safe.

Update body:
Insert old head (5,1) → [(5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)]
Remove tail (8,2) → body becomes [(5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1)]

Continuing this way, moving left each time.

Fifth move: LEFT to (3,1).

Collision check: body is [(5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1)]. New head at (3,1) doesn't collide. Safe.

Update body:
Insert old head (4,1) → [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1)]
Remove tail (8,1) → body becomes [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)]

Sixth move: LEFT to (2,1).

Check collision. Body is [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)]. New head at (2,1) doesn't collide. Safe.

Update body:
Insert old head (3,1) → [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)]
Remove tail (7,1) → body becomes [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]

Now the head is at (2,1). The apple is at (2,0), which is directly below.

Next move: DOWN to (2,0).

Check collision:
Body after previous move is [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)].
New head would be (2,0). Check if it's in the body. The body starts at (3,1) and goes up to (6,1). So no collision except possibly when the tail moves.

But wait, before moving DOWN, let's check:

The current direction is LEFT, so after moving to (2,1), the direction is still LEFT unless we change it.

Wait, each move's direction becomes the new current direction. So first move was LEFT, then second move also LEFT, etc.

So when at (2,1), if I choose DOWN as next move, that's allowed because previous direction was LEFT and we can't reverse to RIGHT, but DOWN is fine.

Now, moving from (2,1) to (2,0):

Check collision with body. The body is [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]. So new head at (2,0). Does any part of the body occupy (2,0)? No.

Also, check for apple: yes, it's there.

So when we move DOWN to (2,0):

- It's the apple position. So after moving here:

Update body:
Insert old head (2,1) at front → [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]
Since it's an apple, don't remove tail.

So new S is:
Head: (2,0)
Body: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]

Now, after eating the apple, we need to ensure that there's space for movement. The next move can't be UP because it would reverse from DOWN.

But regardless, the snake is now at the apple position, so our goal is achieved.

So in total, we've moved LEFT six times and then DOWN once, totaling seven moves. But wait, no: first move was LEFT to (7,1), second to (6,1), third to (5,1), fourth to (4,1), fifth to (3,1), sixth to (2,1), seventh to (2,0). So that's seven steps.

But I need to think if this is the optimal path or if there are any collisions or issues along the way. Let me check each step again for safety.

First move: LEFT to (7,1) – safe.
Second move: LEFT to (6,1) – safe.
Third move: LEFT to (5,1) – safe.
Fourth move: LEFT to (4,1) – safe.
Fifth move: LEFT to (3,1) – safe.
Sixth move: LEFT to (2,1) – safe.
Seventh move: DOWN to (2,0) – safe.

Yes, each step is safe. Also, after the last move, the body doesn't block the head because the tail has moved forward, and there's space below at (2,0).

Therefore, the sequence of moves would be six LEFTs followed by one DOWN.
</think>

The snake should make seven moves: first, move left six times to get from column 8 to column 2 on row 1, then move down once to reach the apple. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Move LEFT**: From (8,1) → (7,1)
2. **Move LEFT**: From (7,1) → (6,1)
3. **Move LEFT**: From (6,1) → (5,1)
4. **Move LEFT**: From (5,1) → (4,1)
5. **Move LEFT**: From (4,1) → (3,1)
6. **Move LEFT**: From (3,1) → (2,1)
7. **Move DOWN**: From (2,1) → (2,0)

This path ensures the snake reaches the apple without colliding with its body and in compliance with movement rules.

Answer: The snake should move left six times followed by one downward move to eat the apple safely. 

The sequence of moves is six times LEFT then DOWN once. So, the answer is \boxed{\text{LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN}}
