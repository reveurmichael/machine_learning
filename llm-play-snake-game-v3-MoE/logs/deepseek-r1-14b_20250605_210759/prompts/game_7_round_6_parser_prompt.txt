<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (6,0), which is on the bottom row of the grid. The direction it's moving is "DOWN". The body cells are given as [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]. So, the snake's body starts just below the head at (6,1) and extends to the left and then slightly up.

The apple is located at (6,2). So, I need to find a path for the snake's head to move from (6,0) to (6,2) without causing any collisions and following all the movement rules.

Since the current direction is "DOWN", I can't reverse it by moving "UP" on the first move. The available directions are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. However, moving DOWN would take the head further down, which might not be helpful because the apple is above. So, perhaps moving RIGHT or LEFT makes more sense.

Looking at the body cells, if I move RIGHT from (6,0), the new head would be at (7,0). But checking the grid, the cell directly below (7,1) might have a body segment. Wait, the body starts at (6,1), so moving right to (7,0) is safe as long as it doesn't collide with any body part except possibly the tail.

Wait, the collision rule says that if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So, in this case, after moving RIGHT, the body would shift, and the tail (4,2) might not affect the new head position because it's far away.

Alternatively, moving LEFT from (6,0) would take the head to (5,0). That seems safe as well, but I'm not sure if that's the optimal path.

Wait, the apple is at (6,2), so maybe moving UP is better. But since the current direction is DOWN, can't choose UP next move because it's a reverse direction. So, first move options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Let me think about moving RIGHT:

1. Move to (7,0) in direction "RIGHT".
   - Check collision: No body parts at (7,0), and within grid bounds.
   - Then, the body updates by adding the old head (6,0) to the front of the body list. The new body becomes [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]. Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed: so the new body would be [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)].
   - Now, head is at (7,0). Next move options are RIGHT, DOWN, or LEFT, but not UP.

Wait, after moving RIGHT, the direction changes to RIGHT, so next moves can't reverse back to LEFT. But I need to reach (6,2), which is two steps above. So maybe this path isn't ideal because it's taking me further right and away from the apple.

Alternatively, if I move LEFT first:

1. Move to (5,0) in direction "LEFT".
   - Check collision: Safe.
   - Body becomes [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)] but since not eating apple, remove tail. So body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)].
   - Head is now at (5,0). Next move options are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT.

Hmm, from (5,0), I can move UP towards the apple. But since current direction after first move was LEFT, next moves can't be RIGHT because that's a reversal? Wait no: movement rules say you cannot reverse into the opposite direction of current direction. So if current direction is LEFT, next can't choose RIGHT.

Wait, in this case, my initial direction is DOWN, so after moving LEFT, the new direction is LEFT. So on the next move, I can't go RIGHT.

This might complicate things because moving towards the apple would require going UP, but let me see:

From (5,0), perhaps move UP to (5,1). But wait, (5,1) is already part of the body after the first move. So that's a collision unless it's the tail.

Wait, after the first move, the body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]. The tail is at (4,1). So moving to (5,1) would collide with BODYi which is not the tail. So that's a collision and invalid.

Hmm, so from (5,0), I can't move UP because it's blocked by (5,1). Maybe move LEFT again to (4,0):

- Move LEFT: new head (4,0).
   - Check collision: safe.
   - Body becomes [(5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] after inserting old head. Then remove tail if no apple eaten. So body is [(5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)].
   - Now, head at (4,0). Next move can't be RIGHT because direction is LEFT.

But then I'm moving away from the apple... This might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the first move should be DOWN, but that's the current direction. Wait, no: movement rules say you cannot reverse, so if current direction is DOWN, next move can't be UP.

Wait, initial direction is DOWN, and after moving in any other direction (LEFT or RIGHT), the new direction becomes that direction, which is allowed as long as it's not a reversal of the previous direction.

So perhaps the first move should be RIGHT to (7,0). Then, from there, I can try to move UP towards the apple.

But let me see:

After moving RIGHT to (7,0), next moves could be UP. But current direction is now RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT.

Wait, but after moving RIGHT once, the direction changes to RIGHT, so in the second step, I need to choose a non-reverse direction. So from (7,0) with direction RIGHT, possible directions are UP or DOWN.

If I then move UP to (7,1), that's within bounds and not colliding with any body segments except possibly the tail.

Wait, after moving to (7,0), the body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]. The next move would be UP to (7,1). Now, check collision: (7,1) isn't in the body except for the tail. Wait, the current tail is at (4,1). So moving to (7,1) is safe.

Then, after moving to (7,1), since it's not the apple position (apple is at 6,2), the tail would be removed. Body becomes [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1)] and then add old head (7,0). So body after second move: [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]. Wait no: when moving to (7,1), the new head is (7,1), so the body is updated by inserting old head (7,0) at front. Then, since not eating apple, remove tail.

So after two moves (RIGHT then UP), the snake's body would be [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)], and head at (7,1). 

But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better path.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN first isn't allowed because current direction is DOWN, but according to movement rules, you can't reverse into the opposite direction. Wait no: initial direction is DOWN, so next move cannot be UP.

Wait, in the initial state, the snake is moving DOWN, which means that on the first move, I can choose any direction except for UP (since it's a reversal). So available directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or remain DOWN.

But if I choose to continue moving DOWN, would that help? Let me see:

1. Move DOWN from (6,0) to (6,-1), but wait, y cannot be negative. That's out of bounds. So moving DOWN is invalid as it leads to death.

So first move must be either LEFT or RIGHT.

Let me try moving LEFT again to (5,0). Then, next move could be UP twice to reach the apple at (6,2). But wait, from (5,0), moving UP would take me to (5,1), but that's part of the body after first move. So collision occurs.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let's consider the snake's current position and body:

Head: (6,0)
Body: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]

So, from (6,0), moving LEFT to (5,0) is safe because none of the body parts are at (5,0). Then, after that move, the body becomes [ (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) ], and tail is removed if not eating apple.

But how do I get to (6,2) from here? Maybe by moving UP twice.

Wait, but in the second step after moving LEFT to (5,0), I can't move RIGHT because that's a reversal of current direction (LEFT). So next moves must be DOWN or UP.

If I then move UP to (5,1), collision occurs because (5,1) is part of body.

Alternatively, from (5,0), move LEFT again to (4,0):

- Move LEFT: new head at (4,0)
   - Body becomes [ (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) ]
   - Remove tail? No apple eaten.
   - So body is [ (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1) ]

Then, next move options: since direction is LEFT, can't go RIGHT. So move UP or DOWN.

If I then move UP to (4,1):

- Head at (4,1)
   - Check collision: (4,1) is the tail after first two moves? Or part of body?
Wait, after moving twice, the body would be [ (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1) ]. So (4,1) is not part of body anymore because we removed the tail.

So moving to (4,1) is safe. Then, from there, I can move UP again to (4,2):

- Move UP: head at (4,2)
   - Check collision: yes, (4,2) is part of the body after previous moves? No, because after first two moves, the tail was removed.

Wait, it's getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT twice to reach (7,0), then up towards apple:

1. Move RIGHT to (7,0)
2. Then move UP to (7,1)
3. Then move LEFT to (6,1) but that's part of body
   Or continue moving UP to (7,2), which is not the apple location.

No, this might not help because the apple is at (6,2).

Alternatively, perhaps after moving RIGHT and then DOWN, but DOWN is invalid as it would go out of bounds.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the shortest path:

From (6,0) to (6,2), need to move UP twice. But how?

But current direction is DOWN, so first move can't be UP because that's a reversal. So possible options are LEFT or RIGHT.

If I choose to move RIGHT once to (7,0), then the next moves can be UP twice without any collision:

1. Move RIGHT: head at (7,0)
   - Body becomes [ (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) ]
2. Move UP: head at (7,1)
3. Move LEFT: head at (6,1) which is part of body after step 1.

Wait, that's a collision because (6,1) is in the body.

Alternatively:

After moving to (7,0), move UP twice:

- Step 2: UP to (7,1)
- Step 3: UP to (7,2). But apple is at (6,2), so need to go left two steps and up one? Not sure.

This seems messy. Maybe the initial move should be LEFT.

After moving LEFT to (5,0):

Then:

Step 2: Move UP to (5,1) - collision with body.

No good.

Alternatively, step 2: move DOWN is invalid as it would go out of bounds.

Hmm. It's a tricky situation.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. After the first move, when I move LEFT or RIGHT, the direction changes, and then in subsequent moves, I can choose any non-reverse directions.

Let me try to plan the path:

Option 1:
Move RIGHT -> UP -> LEFT -> UP

But not sure if that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving RIGHT once, then move UP twice while adjusting the body accordingly. But ensuring no collision.

Wait, let's simulate each step carefully.

Current state:
Head: (6,0)
Body: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]
Direction: DOWN

First move options: LEFT or RIGHT.

Let's choose RIGHT:

Move 1: RIGHT to (7,0)
   - Body becomes [ (6,0) ] inserted at front. Then since not eating apple, remove tail (4,2). So body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]
   - Direction now is RIGHT.

Move 2: UP to (7,1)
   - Check collision: (7,1) is not in the body except possibly the tail. After move 1, tail is at (4,1). So moving to (7,1) is safe.
   - Body becomes [ (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1) ] after inserting old head (7,0). Then remove tail since not eating apple. Body becomes [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)].

Now, head is at (7,1). Direction is UP now because we moved from RIGHT to UP? Wait no: the direction changes based on the move. So moving from (7,0) in direction UP would change direction to UP.

So now, direction is UP.

Move 3: LEFT to (6,1)
   - Check collision: (6,1) is part of body [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]. Since it's not the tail (tail is at (6,1)), moving into (6,1) would cause collision because it's a body part except the tail. So invalid.

Hmm, can't do that.

Alternative move 3: Move DOWN to (7,0), but direction was UP, so next can't be DOWN as it's reversal? No, movement rules say you cannot reverse into the opposite direction of current direction. So from UP, next moves can't be DOWN.

So after moving UP, direction is UP, and next move can't be DOWN.

This complicates things.

Maybe another approach: after move 1 (RIGHT to 7,0), instead of moving UP in step 2, move RIGHT again:

Move 2: RIGHT to (8,0). Check collision: safe.
   - Body becomes [ (7,0) inserted at front, then old body [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] becomes [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)], and tail is removed since no apple. So body is [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]
   - Direction now RIGHT.

Move 3: UP to (8,1). Check collision: safe.
   - Body becomes [ (8,0) inserted at front, then previous body parts. Tail removed.
   - Now head at (8,1).

This seems to be taking me away from the apple. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after move 1 (RIGHT), perhaps move UP once, then adjust direction.

But this isn't leading me towards the apple quickly.

Let's consider moving LEFT first:

Move 1: LEFT to (5,0)
   - Body becomes [ (6,0) inserted at front, so body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]. Tail removed. So body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]
   - Direction now LEFT.

Move 2: can't move RIGHT because direction is LEFT.
   - Options are DOWN or UP.

If I move DOWN from (5,0) to (5,-1): invalid as out of bounds.

So must move UP to (5,1):

   - Check collision: (5,1) is part of body [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]. So moving into it causes collision unless it's the tail. But after move 1, the body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1)], so (5,1) is the last segment. So if I move into (5,1), it would be a collision with BODYi which is not the tail (since direction changed to LEFT). Wait, but in this case, after moving UP, the new head is (5,1), and the body includes (5,1) as the last part.

So when you insert the old head (6,0) at front, the body becomes [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]. Then, moving into (5,1) would mean that new head is same as the last body part. Since the tail isn't being moved yet? Wait, no: when you move, you insert the old head at front, then remove the tail if not eating apple.

So in this case, after move 2 (UP to (5,1)):

- Body becomes [ (6,0), (6,1), (5,1) ] with new head at (5,1).
   - Then, since we didn't eat apple, remove the tail. The tail was (5,1), so after removal, body is [(6,0), (6,1)].

But wait, that's not correct because moving into (5,1) would cause collision with BODYi which is part of the snake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can't move into (5,1) as it's part of body. So after moving LEFT to (5,0), next moves must be UP or DOWN, but moving UP causes collision.

So perhaps this path isn't viable either.

This is really challenging. Maybe there's no way to reach the apple without extending further?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the snake moves and grows. If the snake eats the apple, it grows by adding a segment. So in our case, we just need to find a path that allows the head to reach (6,2) without colliding with its own body.

Let me try again:

Option: move RIGHT twice, then UP twice, but ensuring no collision.

Move 1: RIGHT to (7,0)
   - Body: [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]
      (Removed tail at (4,2))
Move 2: UP to (7,1)
   - Body: [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]
Move 3: LEFT to (6,1) → collision
No good.

Alternative:

After move 1: (7,0)

Move 2: RIGHT to (8,0)
   - Body: [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]
Move 3: UP to (8,1)
   - Body: [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]
Move 4: LEFT to (7,1)
   - Body: [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)] → Moving into (7,1) which is not part of body yet.
Wait, no. After move 3, the head is at (8,1). Then moving LEFT to (7,1):

   - Insert old head (8,1) at front: [(8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0)]
   - Remove tail since not eating apple. Tail was (6,1). So body becomes [(8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0)].

Wait, this isn't helping. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Perhaps the answer is that it's impossible to reach the apple from the given position and direction without extending further. But maybe not, perhaps there's a way.

Alternatively, consider moving in a figure-eight pattern or some loop to extend the body and then maneuver into place.

Wait, but the initial body is quite long, so maybe it's possible.

Another approach: Since the snake needs to reach (6,2), which is two steps up from its current head position. But due to direction restrictions, it can't move UP immediately.

So perhaps the solution involves moving in a way that creates space above the head.

For example:

Move 1: RIGHT to (7,0) → body now [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]
Direction: RIGHT

Move 2: UP to (7,1) → body becomes [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]
Direction: UP

Now, the head is at (7,1). Next, move LEFT twice to reach (5,1):

But moving LEFT would require changing direction from UP.

Wait, movement can be in any direction except reverse. So from UP, you can't go DOWN, but can go LEFT or RIGHT or stay? Or no, in grid movement, typically you can choose any direction except the one that's opposite to current direction.

Wait, in most snake games, when moving in a certain direction, you can change direction to left, right, or continue straight, but not reverse. So from UP, you can go LEFT, RIGHT, or stay UP; just can't go DOWN.

So after move 2 (UP), head is at (7,1), direction UP.

Move 3: LEFT to (6,1)

   - Insert old head (7,1) at front → [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]
   - Remove tail since not eating apple. Tail was (5,1). So body becomes [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0)].

Now head is at (6,1).

Move 4: UP to (6,2) → this is the apple location!

Wait, but let's check:

After move 3, head is at (6,1). Then moving UP would take it to (6,2), which is where the apple is.

But we need to ensure that when the snake moves into (6,2), it doesn't collide with its body.

Current body after move 3: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]

So moving from (6,1) to (6,2):

   - Insert old head (6,1) at front → [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]
   - Remove tail since not eating apple. Tail was (6,0). So body becomes [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0)].

Wait, no: when moving, the head moves to new position, then the rest follows. But in this case, moving into (6,2) which is empty space? Or is it?

Actually, the apple is at (6,2), so when the snake's head moves there, it eats the apple and grows.

So after move 4:

- Head moves from (6,1) to (6,2).
   - Body becomes [(6,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]
But wait, no: the body segments follow. So when you insert the old head at front, but since we ate the apple, the tail isn't removed.

Wait, correction:

When the snake eats the apple, it grows by adding a segment at the end instead of removing. So in this case, moving into (6,2) would add a segment, making the body longer.

So let's correct step 4:

Move 4: UP to (6,2)

   - Since this is where the apple is, the snake grows.
   - Insert old head (6,1) at front → [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]
   - Then add new segment at end (from movement). Wait, no: when you move, each segment follows. So moving to (6,2) adds a new head there and the body follows.

Actually, I think I'm getting confused about how the snake's body updates.

Let me clarify:

In each step, the head moves in the current direction. Then, each subsequent segment moves into the position of the previous one. If food is eaten (apple), the tail isn't removed; otherwise, it is.

So for our case:

After move 3: Head at (6,1). Body segments are [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0)].

Move 4: UP to (6,2).

   - New head position: (6,2)
   - The previous head (6,1) moves to where the new head was? No.

Wait, no. When moving, each part of the body follows the one in front. So:

- Original positions after move 3:
   Head: (6,1)
   Body: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]

Move direction is UP from (6,1) → new head at (6,2).

Then, each segment follows:

- The first body part (7,1) moves to (6,1).
- Second body part (7,0) moves to (7,1).
- Third body part (6,0) moves to (7,0).

So after move 4, the body becomes:

Head: (6,2)
Body parts: [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0)]

But wait, we ate the apple at (6,2). So the snake grows by adding a segment. Therefore, instead of removing the tail, we add a new segment.

So after move 4:

- Head is at (6,2)
- Body parts are [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0)]
But since apple was eaten, the tail isn't removed; instead, a new segment is added where the head was before moving. So the previous head (6,1) becomes the next segment.

Wait, no: when you eat food, the body length increases by one. So in this case:

- Before move 4:
   - Length: 3 segments (excluding head)
- After eating apple:
   - Length: 4 segments.

But I'm getting confused about how exactly the body updates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each step precisely.

Let me try again with detailed steps:

Initial state before any moves:
Head: (6,0)
Body: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]
Direction: DOWN

Move 1: RIGHT
   - New head position: (7,0)
   - Insert at front: body becomes [(6,0)] + old body without tail.
      Old body after removing tail (which was (4,2)) is [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]
   - So new body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]
   - Direction: RIGHT

Move 2: UP
   - New head position: (7,1)
   - Insert at front: body becomes [(7,0)] + previous body without tail.
      Previous body after removing last segment (which was (4,1)) is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]
   - So new body is [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]
   - Direction: UP

Move 3: LEFT
   - New head position: (6,1)
   - Insert at front: body becomes [(7,1)] + previous body without tail.
      Previous body after removing last segment (which was (5,1)) is [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]
   - So new body is [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]
   - Direction: LEFT

Move 4: UP
   - New head position: (6,2)
   - Since this is the apple's location, we eat it and grow.
   - Insert at front: body becomes [(6,1)] + previous body without tail.
      Previous body after removing last segment (which was (6,1)) is [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]
   - So new body is [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]
   - Since we ate the apple, we add a new segment at the end. The new head is (6,2), and the previous segments shift.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it too much. Let's just focus on whether the path leads to eating the apple without collision.

The key points:

1. Move RIGHT to (7,0)
2. Move UP to (7,1)
3. Move LEFT to (6,1)
4. Move UP to (6,2) where the apple is.

At each step, we need to ensure that the new head position isn't already occupied by any part of the body except for when it's a legal move (i.e., growing after eating).

In this case:

After moving LEFT to (6,1), the body is [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]. So (6,1) is not part of the body yet.

Then, moving UP to (6,2) which is empty space (apple is there). Upon eating, the snake grows, so it's allowed.

Therefore, the answer should be that the snake can eat the apple by making these four moves: RIGHT, UP, LEFT, UP.

So the sequence of directions would be RIGHT → UP → LEFT → UP.

But let me check for any possible collisions:

- After move 1 (RIGHT): body is [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] → head at (7,0). No collision.
- After move 2 (UP): body becomes [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)] → head at (7,1). Checking if any part of the body is at (7,1)? The body after insertion is [(7,0), ...], so no.
- After move 3 (LEFT): body becomes [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)] → head at (6,1). Checking if any part of the body is at (6,1)? The last segment is (6,1) which was just moved from (5,1). Wait, no: after move 3, the body segments are [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]. So when moving LEFT to (6,1), the new head is there and the body follows. Since the apple hasn't been eaten yet, tail is removed? Or wait, in this case, since we're not eating, we remove the last segment.

Wait, no: After move 3:

- Before move 3:
   - Head at (7,1)
   - Body: [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]
   - Direction: UP

Move 3: LEFT → new head at (6,1). The body segments will follow.

So the new body after move 3 is:

[(6,1)] + previous body excluding last segment.

Wait, I think my earlier approach was wrong. Let me model it correctly.

Each move:

- Current head moves in direction.
- Each subsequent segment moves to where the previous one was.
- If food is eaten (apple), tail isn't removed; otherwise, it is.

So step-by-step:

Initial:
Head: (6,0)
Body: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]
Tail: (4,2)

Move 1: RIGHT → new head at (7,0). Body follows:

- New body segments are previous positions shifted right.

Wait, no. When moving, each segment takes the position of the one in front.

So after move 1 (RIGHT):

Head is now at (7,0).

Body parts:
Previous head (6,0) moves to where the new head was? No. The body follows:

Original body: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]

After moving RIGHT, each segment shifts:

- First body part (6,1) → becomes new position of head (7,0)? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the entire snake as a list where each element is a coordinate.

Let's represent the snake as [head, body1, body2, ..., tail].

Each move, we add a new head in the direction and remove the last segment unless food is eaten.

So:

Initial:
snake = [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]
food at (4,2)

Move 1: RIGHT
new_head = (7,0)
new_snake = [new_head] + snake[:-1]
= [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]

Check if new_head == food? No.

So snake becomes [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]
Direction: RIGHT

Move 2: UP
new_head = (7,1)
new_snake = [new_head] + snake[:-1]
= [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]

Check if new_head == food? No.

Snake becomes [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]
Direction: UP

Move 3: LEFT
new_head = (6,1)
new_snake = [new_head] + snake[:-1]
= [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]

Check if new_head == food? No.

Snake becomes [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]
Direction: LEFT

Move 4: UP
new_head = (6,2)
Check if new_head is food (yes, it's at (6,2)).

So since we eat the food, we don't remove the tail. Instead, we add a new segment at the end.

Wait, no. When you eat food, the snake grows by adding one segment to its length. So in this case, the new_snake would be:

new_snake = [new_head] + snake

Because instead of removing the last segment, we keep all segments and add the new head.

So:

snake before move 4: [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]

Move 4 direction: UP → new_head = (6,2)

Since it's food, new_snake = [new_head] + snake

= [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]

So now the snake is longer by one segment.

Thus, the snake successfully ate the apple at (6,2) without colliding with its body in any step.

Therefore, the answer is that yes, it's possible, and the sequence of moves is RIGHT → UP → LEFT → UP.
</think>

The snake can eat the apple by moving right, up, left, then up. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (6,0), body segments are [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1)], and the tail is at (4,2). The apple is located at (6,2).

2. **Move Right**: 
   - New head position: (7,0)
   - Body updates to [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]
   
3. **Move Up**: 
   - New head position: (7,1)
   - Body updates to [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]

4. **Move Left**: 
   - New head position: (6,1)
   - Body updates to [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0)]

5. **Move Up (to eat apple)**: 
   - New head position: (6,2) where the apple is.
   - Since it's the apple's location, the snake grows, and the body becomes [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0)].

This sequence allows the snake to eat the apple without colliding with its own body in any step.

**Answer**: The snake can successfully eat the apple by moving right, up, left, then up. So, the moves are \boxed{\text{RIGHT, UP, LEFT, UP}}.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 0) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (6, 2). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
