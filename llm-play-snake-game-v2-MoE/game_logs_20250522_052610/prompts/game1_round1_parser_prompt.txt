<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how the snake can move from (5,5) to eat the apple at (1,0). Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the snake's head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (1,0). The grid is 10x10, so it's a pretty big area. The current direction is NONE, which means any initial move is allowed, except that I can't reverse direction on the first move. Wait, no—rule 3 says if direction is NONE, any move is allowed. So the first move isn't restricted by previous direction.

The body cells are empty, so the snake's length is just the head plus whatever it grows when it eats the apple. But since we're planning moves before eating, I don't have to worry about the body except for potential collisions as the snake moves and grows.

I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause the snake to collide with its body or go out of bounds. Also, after eating the apple, there should be at least one legal move left to avoid traps.

The Manhattan distance from (5,5) to (1,0) is |5-1| + |5-0| = 4+5=9 steps. But that's just a heuristic; I need to find a path that avoids obstacles.

Looking at the apple position (1,0), it's on the bottom-left side. The snake needs to move left and down from (5,5). Wait, no—since (5,5) is the current head, moving to (1,0) would require going west (left) 4 units and south (down) 5 units. But wait, in terms of grid movement: since y increases as we go up, but the apple is at y=0, which is the bottom row.

Wait, according to the coordinate system, UP increases y by 1, so moving from (5,5) to (1,0) would require going down and left. Wait no—because (1,0) is lower than (5,5), both in x and y. So the snake needs to move west (left) 4 steps and south (down) 5 steps.

Wait, but from (5,5), moving left takes it towards lower x, and moving down takes it towards lower y. So total movement is 4 lefts and 5 downs. But how do I arrange that in the moves?

But also, since each move changes direction, I can't reverse direction immediately. For example, if the first move is LEFT, then the next can't be RIGHT. Similarly for other directions.

Let me think about possible paths. The apple is at (1,0). So the snake needs to get there without hitting walls or its own body.

Since the body is empty initially, I don't have to worry about that except when moving; each step adds a new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, but in this problem, we're just planning moves up to eating the apple. So after the last move, the snake's head will be at (1,0), having eaten the apple, which increases its body length by one segment. Then, after that, there must be at least one more legal move.

So I need to plan a path where the snake moves from (5,5) to (1,0) without hitting itself or walls, and then ensure that after eating, there's space to move further.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

The apple is at (1,0). The head starts at (5,5). So the path needs to go west 4 times and south 5 times. But movement can't be done in straight lines without considering direction changes.

Wait, but each move changes the direction of the snake's head, so I have to plan a path that doesn't reverse direction. Also, after each move, the body segments shift.

Hmm, maybe it's best to find a path that moves directly towards the apple, adjusting for any potential collisions.

Let me consider possible steps:

1. First, check if there are any immediate obstacles. Since the body is empty, no issues at first.

2. The goal is (1,0). So from (5,5), I need to get west and south.

3. Let's see: moving left (west) will decrease x by 1 each time. Moving down decreases y by 1.

But wait, the snake can't reverse direction immediately after NONE. Wait no—since current direction is NONE, any move is allowed first.

So for the first move, I can choose LEFT or DOWN.

If I go LEFT first, then next move can't be RIGHT. So from (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5). Then from there, maybe DOWN to (4,4), etc., until reaching (1,0).

But let me count the required steps: 4 lefts and 5 downs.

So a possible path is:

Move LEFT four times and DOWN five times. But since each move changes direction, I can't do all LEFT first then all DOWN—because that would require reversing direction after each, which isn't allowed unless it's NONE.

Wait no—the snake cannot reverse direction on the next step. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next can't be RIGHT, but could be UP or DOWN.

But in this case, since we start with NONE, any first move is possible.

So perhaps a path like: LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, etc., alternating directions as needed.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to go directly south first to clear the y-axis and then west. Let me think.

From (5,5), moving DOWN once would take it to (5,4). Then, can I move left? Since direction is now DOWN, next move can't be UP.

So from (5,4), move LEFT to (4,4). From there, direction is LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT. So move DOWN to (4,3), then LEFT to (3,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.

Wait, maybe it's better to plan a straight path since the body is empty initially.

But since each move changes direction and we can't reverse immediately, perhaps I need to alternate between moving west and south in such a way that I don't have to reverse direction.

Alternatively, could I make a U-turn? No, because after moving in one direction, say LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So to change direction, I'd have to make a 90-degree turn by moving UP or DOWN after LEFT.

Wait, perhaps it's better to go directly south as much as possible and then west.

Let me try:

Move DOWN once: (5,4)
Then LEFT: (4,4)
DOWN again: (4,3)
LEFT: (3,3)
DOWN: (3,2)
LEFT: (2,2)
DOWN: (2,1)
LEFT: (1,1)
But wait, that's not the apple. The apple is at (1,0), so I'm at (1,1) after these moves.

Then I need to move DOWN once more to reach (1,0). Let me see:

So the sequence would be:

DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN

Wait that's 8 moves. Wait no—each pair is a DOWN and LEFT, which requires direction changes.

But let's count:

Starting at (5,5).

1. Move DOWN to (5,4) → Direction: DOWN
2. Next move can't be UP. So move LEFT to (4,4) → Direction: LEFT
3. From LEFT, next can't be RIGHT. So move DOWN to (4,3)
4. From DOWN, move LEFT to (3,3)
5. From LEFT, move DOWN to (3,2)
6. From DOWN, move LEFT to (2,2)
7. From LEFT, move DOWN to (2,1)
8. From DOWN, move LEFT to (1,1)
9. Now at (1,1), need to go down once more: move DOWN to (1,0)

So that's 9 moves.

But let me check if any of these steps would cause the snake to collide with its body. Since initially, the body is empty, but after each move, the body grows unless it eats an apple.

Wait no—after moving, the head becomes the new position, and the previous positions become part of the body (except when eating). So in this case, since we're not eating until the last step, after each move except the 9th, the tail is removed because no apple is eaten yet. Wait, but the snake only grows when it eats an apple. So up to the 8th move, each time the snake moves, the tail is removed.

Wait, wait—the body cells are empty initially, so let's see:

Each move adds a new head position and removes the tail (unless an apple was eaten). Since in this case, we're only eating the apple on the last move, so up to that point, each movement shifts the body.

So for example, after the first move (DOWN to 5,4), the body is empty except for the new head. Wait no—the body cells are given as an empty list. So initially, the snake's body is just [(5,5)], and when it moves, it adds a new head and removes the tail.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

The snake's body includes all segments except the head. Each move shifts the head to the new position, then each existing segment (except the tail if no apple was eaten) becomes the next segment.

But since in this problem, we're planning moves up to eating the apple, so before that, each move causes the tail to be removed unless an apple is eaten on that step. But until the last move, no apple has been eaten yet, right?

So for each of the first 8 moves, the snake moves and the body grows by one (since it's moving without eating), but since the body was empty before, perhaps not.

Wait no—the initial body cells are empty because the problem says "body cells: [] — List of (x, y) positions occupied by the snake's body (excluding the head)." So initially, the snake is just the head at (5,5). So when it makes a move, the new head is added, and the old head becomes part of the body. But since there were no body cells before, after the first move, the body will have one cell: (5,5), and the head is now at (5,4) if moved down.

Wait, but each movement shifts all the segments. So when moving from (5,5) to (5,4), the new head is at (5,4), and the old position (5,5) becomes part of the body. Since the initial body was empty, after this first move, the body has [ (5,5) ].

Then, on the next move, say LEFT to (4,4), the new head is (4,4), and the previous head (5,4) becomes part of the body. So the body now has [ (5,5), (5,4) ]. Wait no—because after each move, the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

Wait, in normal movement without eating, each step adds a new head and removes the tail. So for example:

- Initial state: head at (5,5), body empty.
- Move DOWN: new head (5,4), body becomes [ (5,5) ] (since no apple eaten yet).
- Next move LEFT: new head (4,4), body is [ (5,5), (5,4) ], but wait—no. Because the snake's body shifts: the previous head (5,4) is now part of the body, and the tail (5,5) is removed because no apple was eaten in this move.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me refer back to the movement rules:

After each move, the new head becomes the body segment, and the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten on that step.

So initial state: head at (5,5), body empty.

1st move: DOWN → new head (5,4). Since no apple eaten yet, the old head (5,5) is added to the body, but since it's the only segment, does the tail get removed? Wait, wait—body cells after first move would be [ (5,5) ], because when you move, the new head is at (5,4), and the previous head is now part of the body. Since no apple was eaten, the tail is removed? Or is it that each step adds a new segment to the front and removes one from the end?

Wait, perhaps I should model this:

Each move, the head moves in the given direction.

- The new head position is calculated.
- If the new head collides with any part of the body (including the previous head), the snake dies.
- If it's a valid move, then:
   - The new head becomes the new head.
   - All existing body segments become shifted forward: each segment moves to the next position. So the first body cell follows the old head, and so on.
   - Unless an apple was eaten in this move, the tail is removed (the last body segment is discarded). If an apple was eaten, the body grows by one (so the tail isn't removed; it stays).

Wait no—the problem says: "Tail is removed unless apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains)." So when you eat an apple during a move, the tail doesn't get removed, thus increasing the length.

So for each move:

- New head = current head + direction
- Check if new head is valid (not in body and within grid)
- If valid:
   - Add new head to the beginning of the body list
   - If apple was not eaten, remove the last element from the body (the tail)

But wait, no—the initial description says that after moving, the head becomes a body segment, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the movement as:

- The snake's body is a list of positions, starting with the head at the front.

Each move:

1. Calculate new head position based on direction.
2. Check if new head collides with any part of the body (including itself) or goes out of bounds → die if so.
3. If valid:
   a. Prepend the new head to the body list.
   b. If an apple was not eaten in this move, remove the last element from the body (the tail). Otherwise, keep it.

Wait, but eating the apple only happens once per step. So during each movement:

- The snake moves, and if that step lands on the apple's position, then the apple is eaten, and the body doesn't lose a segment.

So for our scenario, until the last move, no apple has been eaten yet. So in each of the first 8 moves, after moving, the tail (last element) is removed because the apple hasn't been eaten.

Wait, but when you make the 9th move, which lands on the apple, then during that step, the body doesn't lose a segment.

So let's model this:

Initial state: head at (5,5), body empty. So the full snake is [ (5,5) ].

Move 1: DOWN → new head (5,4). Since no apple eaten, the tail (which was none before) isn't removed? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each move appends the new position to a list, and when an apple is not eaten, the oldest position is popped from the end (the tail).

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the snake's body as a queue:

- Each time you move without eating, you add a new head and remove the old tail.
- When you eat, you add a new head but don't remove the tail.

So let's go through each step for our 9-move plan:

1. Move DOWN from (5,5) to (5,4). Since no apple eaten yet:
   - New body: [ (5,5), (5,4) ] → but wait, since after moving, you add the new head and remove the tail? Wait, initial body is empty.

Wait, perhaps when moving, the current head becomes part of the body if not eaten. So let me model each step:

Start:
- Head: (5,5)
- Body: []

Move 1: DOWN → (5,4). Since no apple, remove tail from body? But body was empty. So new body is [ (5,5) ].

So now:
- Head: (5,4)
- Body: [ (5,5) ]

Move 2: LEFT → (4,4). No apple eaten yet.
- New head: (4,4)
- Previous body becomes [ (5,5), (5,4) ]
- Remove tail? Since no apple, the new body is [ (5,5), (5,4) ] without the previous tail. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Maybe an alternative approach is to realize that until the last move, the snake's body will be only one segment behind it, because each movement shifts the head and removes the tail unless eating.

So after the first move (DOWN):

- Head: (5,4)
- Body: [ (5,5) ]

Move 2: LEFT → (4,4). Since no apple eaten yet:
- New body is [ (5,4), (4,4) ] but with tail removal. Wait, perhaps each movement adds the new head to the front and removes the last element unless eating.

So after move 1:

- Body was empty before moving.
- After moving DOWN: head is (5,4). The old head (5,5) becomes part of the body. So body = [ (5,5) ].
- Since no apple eaten, tail is removed? But there's only one element in body, so it remains.

Wait, perhaps when you move without eating, the new position is added to the front, and the last element is popped from the back.

So:

Move 1: DOWN
- New head: (5,4)
- Body was empty before moving. So after adding, body becomes [ (5,4) ] but since no apple eaten, we remove tail which would be nothing? Or perhaps for the first move, it's just the new head.

I think I'm getting stuck on modeling the exact movement steps, so maybe instead of worrying about the body, I can plan a path that doesn't cause collision with itself until the last step when it eats the apple.

In any case, let's proceed with the initial idea:

A sequence of alternating DOWN and LEFT moves to navigate from (5,5) down along y-axis then west along x=1 to reach (1,0).

But wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe a more efficient path is possible.

Alternatively, could I move directly south 5 times to go from y=5 to y=0? That would require moving down five steps:

From (5,5) → (5,4), (5,3), ..., (5,0). Then move LEFT once to (4,0), but that's not the target.

Wait no—target is (1,0), so after reaching y=0 at x=5, moving left four times would take it to (1,0).

So total moves: 5 downs and 4 lefts → 9 moves.

But each move changes direction, which may require checking if the next move is allowed (i.e., not reversing direction).

Wait, but starting with NONE, first move can be any direction. Let's see:

Move 1: DOWN to (5,4)
Move 2: LEFT to (4,4) → can't reverse because previous was DOWN; LEFT is okay.
Move 3: DOWN to (4,3)
Move 4: LEFT to (3,3)
Move 5: DOWN to (3,2)
Move 6: LEFT to (2,2)
Move 7: DOWN to (2,1)
Move 8: LEFT to (1,1)
Move 9: DOWN to (1,0)

This seems valid.

But does this path cause any collision?

After each move except the last, the snake's body is just the previous position. So for example:

After Move 1: head at (5,4), body [ (5,5) ] → no collision.
Move 2: head at (4,4), body [ (5,5), (5,4) ]? Wait, but after moving LEFT from (5,4), the new head is (4,4). The previous positions are (5,4) and (5,5). But in this movement step, since no apple was eaten, the tail would be removed. So body becomes [ (5,5), (5,4) ] after Move 2? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each move adds the new head and the body follows, but only keeps track of all positions except the head.

But regardless, since we're not revisiting any positions until the last step, there shouldn't be a collision.

Wait, in this path:

The snake moves from (5,5) → (5,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,0).

Each new position is unique and not overlapping with any previous positions except possibly the body segments. But since each move only adds one new segment (except when eating), as long as we don't revisit a previously occupied spot, it should be safe.

So this 9-move plan seems viable.

But wait, I'm wondering if there's a shorter path possible. For example, moving west first and then south.

From (5,5):

1. LEFT to (4,5)
2. DOWN to (4,4)
3. LEFT to (3,4)
4. DOWN to (3,3)
5. LEFT to (2,3)
6. DOWN to (2,2)
7. LEFT to (1,2)
8. DOWN to (1,1)
9. DOWN to (1,0)

Same number of moves, 9 steps.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to make fewer moves by combining some directions, but I don't think so because each move changes the direction unless you continue in the same direction without reversing.

Wait, no—if you can change direction as long as it's not reversing. So for example:

Move 1: DOWN
Move 2: LEFT (allowed)
Move 3: DOWN again? Wait, but previous was LEFT; moving DOWN is allowed because it's not reversing. Or wait—can't reverse, so if the last move was LEFT, next can be UP or DOWN, except RIGHT.

Wait no—the rule is that you cannot make a U-turn, i.e., reverse direction on the next step.

So after moving LEFT, you can't move RIGHT next. But you can move UP or DOWN.

In our initial plan, we alternated between DOWN and LEFT moves, which should be allowed because they're not reverses.

Therefore, 9 moves are needed to reach (1,0) from (5,5).

But wait, perhaps another approach: since the snake starts at (5,5), can it make a diagonal-like path by moving in directions that don't require reversing? But each move is orthogonal; you can't move diagonally.

Alternatively, maybe a more efficient path exists with fewer moves. Let me think:

Each move changes direction except when continuing straight. So perhaps the minimal number of moves is 5 (down) + 4 (left) =9.

Wait, but movement requires changing directions alternately unless possible to continue in same direction without reversing.

But I don't see a way to get to (1,0) in fewer than 9 moves.

So the plan is:

Move DOWN, then LEFT, repeating until reaching (1,0).

Thus, the sequence of directions would be: [DOWN, LEFT] *4 + [DOWN], totaling 9 moves.

But let me confirm each step:

Step 1: Move DOWN from (5,5) → (5,4)
Step 2: Move LEFT from (5,4) → (4,4)
Step 3: Move DOWN from (4,4) → (4,3)
Step 4: Move LEFT from (4,3) → (3,3)
Step 5: Move DOWN from (3,3) → (3,2)
Step 6: Move LEFT from (3,2) → (2,2)
Step 7: Move DOWN from (2,2) → (2,1)
Step 8: Move LEFT from (2,1) → (1,1)
Step 9: Move DOWN from (1,1) → (1,0)

Yes, this works.

Another alternative could be to move further down before moving left, but I think it's similar in number of steps.

So the answer is that the snake can reach the food in 9 moves.
</think>

The snake starts at position (5,5) and needs to reach the food at (1,0). By systematically moving down and then left alternately, the snake can navigate without reversing direction until it reaches its destination. Each move changes direction except when continuing straight isn't possible due to the no U-turn rule.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move DOWN:** From (5,5) → (5,4)
2. **Move LEFT:** From (5,4) → (4,4)
3. **Move DOWN:** From (4,4) → (4,3)
4. **Move LEFT:** From (4,3) → (3,3)
5. **Move DOWN:** From (3,3) → (3,2)
6. **Move LEFT:** From (3,2) → (2,2)
7. **Move DOWN:** From (2,2) → (2,1)
8. **Move LEFT:** From (2,1) → (1,1)
9. **Move DOWN:** From (1,1) → (1,0)

**Answer:**

The snake can reach the food in 9 moves by alternating between moving down and left until it arrives at position (1,0). 

\boxed{9}
