========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 3 units right (x from 2→5) and 3 units down (y from 5→2). Starting with RIGHT avoids reversing the initial DOWN direction. Subsequent DOWN moves reduce the y-coordinate, while RIGHT moves increase the x-coordinate. Each step checks for collisions with the body (which shifts safely) and stays within grid bounds. After reaching the apple, the snake can move DOWN or RIGHT next, avoiding entrapment."
