Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this AI snake eat the apple without dying. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the current state:

- The head is at (3,7).
- The direction is LEFT, which means the snake was moving left before. So the next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse direction. Wait, no—rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. Since it's currently going LEFT, the next move can't be DOWN, but actually, wait: the current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be RIGHT? Or does it mean you can't switch to the opposite direction. Hmm, I think rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. So if the snake is moving LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT because that's the opposite.

Wait no, actually, the current direction is given as LEFT, so according to movement rules, the snake cannot move in the opposite direction next. The current direction is LEFT; so any move except NONE (which I think is when you're not moving). Wait, the initial direction is LEFT, so the first move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing.

Wait, no: rule 3 says if the direction is "NONE", any move is allowed. But in this case, the current direction is LEFT, so the next move cannot be DOWN? Or wait, let me check movement rules again.

Movement rules say you can't reverse direction. So if the snake is moving UP, it can't move DOWN next. Similarly, moving LEFT means the next move can't be RIGHT, and vice versa.

Wait no: Reversing would mean going in the exact opposite direction. So from LEFT, reversing would be RIGHT, so that's not allowed. From UP, reversing is DOWN; so those are forbidden next moves.

So current head position is (3,7). The apple is at (3,8), which is directly above the head. So moving UP would take the head to (3,8) and eat the apple.

But wait: Let me check the body cells. The body is [(5,7), (4,7)]. So the snake's body is behind the head. Since it's moving LEFT, the body follows in that direction. Wait, but the current direction is LEFT, so the last move was LEFT from (4,7) to (3,7). Now, the next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse.

So from (3,7), if I move UP, which is allowed because it's not reversing, then the head goes to (3,8), eat the apple. But what about the body? After moving UP, the new head is at (3,8). The old head becomes part of the body. So the body now includes (3,7) plus the previous body cells: [(5,7), (4,7)]. Wait no—the body list given is the current body excluding the head. So after moving, the tail doesn't shrink because we ate an apple.

Wait, when you eat the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't move. But in this case, since we're at (3,7), and moving UP to (3,8) would eat the apple, which is right there.

But wait, let's think about the path:

1. Current head: (3,7)
2. Direction: LEFT
3. Body cells: [(5,7), (4,7)]

So the snake's body is extending from (5,7) down to (4,7), then the head is at (3,7). So moving LEFT would take it to (2,7), but that's not necessary because the apple is above.

But if we move UP, we can reach the apple in one step. But let's check if this causes any collision with the body after moving.

When we move up, the head becomes (3,8). The new body will be [(3,7)] + previous body cells: so the body becomes [(5,7), (4,7), (3,7)]. Now, is there a collision? Well, the new head is at (3,8), and the body is from (5,7) to (3,7). So no overlap between (3,8) and the body. So that's safe.

But wait: after eating the apple, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't shrink. But in this case, since we're moving directly towards the apple, maybe it's possible.

So the moves would be just "UP". Let me check:

- Current direction is LEFT, which allows any move except RIGHT (since that would reverse). So UP is allowed.
- Moving UP takes head to (3,8), eats apple. The body becomes [(5,7), (4,7), (3,7)] but the tail doesn't shrink because we ate an apple.

But wait, after moving up, does the snake's body update correctly? Let me think:

When you move, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless you eat an apple. But in this case, since the move eats the apple, the tail stays. So after eating, the body includes all previous segments plus the new one.

So the path seems safe with just one move: UP.

But wait, could there be any issues? For example, does moving up cause a collision with any part of the body before moving?

After moving, the head is at (3,8). The body is now [(5,7), (4,7), (3,7)]. So no overlap. Also, since we're not reversing direction and within grid bounds.

Therefore, the moves would be ["UP"], and the reasoning is that moving up directly to the apple's position without any risk of collision or going out of bounds.
</think>

The snake can move directly upwards from (3,7) to (3,8) in one step, as this doesn't reverse direction and avoids collisions with its body.

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP"],
  "reasoning": "Moving UP directly leads the head to the apple at (3,8) without reversing direction or colliding with the body."
}

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:

}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the head now at (3, 7) to eat the apple at (3, 8).

RULES:
- Text at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 is less important than the text at the end.
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
