Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this snake can reach the apple at (8,3) without getting itself killed. Let's start by looking at the current state.

The head is at (0,9), and the body is a series of segments starting from (1,9) down to (5,8). The apple is at (8,3), which seems pretty far away in terms of both x and y coordinates. Since the snake can't reverse direction immediately after the first move unless it's moving "NONE" initially, I need to plan a path that doesn't require sudden 180-degree turns.

First, let me consider the current direction is LEFT. So the next move can't be RIGHT or DOWN because reversing isn't allowed except on the first move if the direction was NONE. But since the initial direction is LEFT, any subsequent move must continue in a way that doesn't reverse.

Looking at the grid, moving LEFT from (0,9) would take the snake to (-1,9), which is outside the grid. Wait, no—the x-coordinates go from 0 to 9, so moving left from (0,9) would actually be impossible because it's already on the edge. Hmm, that might not be possible. Maybe the initial direction being LEFT isn't the best idea.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. If the head is at (0,9), moving LEFT would decrease the x-coordinate, but since x can't be less than 0, moving LEFT from there would cause a collision with the grid boundary. So perhaps the snake can't move LEFT anymore because it's already on the edge.

Given that, maybe the initial direction isn't usable beyond this point. So, what other options are there? The directions allowed are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but after the first move, you can't reverse unless it's the first move and the direction was NONE.

Wait, but the current direction is LEFT, so any next move must not be a reversal. Since moving LEFT from (0,9) would cause an out-of-bounds collision, that's not possible. So perhaps the snake needs to change direction to UP or RIGHT to proceed towards the apple.

But wait, moving UP from (0,9) would take it to (0,10), which is also out of bounds. So that's no good either. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

Wait a second—maybe I should check the grid boundaries again. The coordinates are from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So, y=9 is the top edge. Moving UP from (0,9) would take it to y=10, which is indeed outside the grid.

So moving LEFT or UP from the head's current position isn't possible because it's already on the edges and those moves would cause immediate death. Therefore, the snake must move in a direction that allows it to proceed towards the apple without causing an out-of-bounds collision.

Looking at the directions again, since the current direction is LEFT, which would prevent moving RIGHT next, but we can't move LEFT or UP because of grid boundaries. So perhaps the only possible moves are DOWN and RIGHT, but I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Wait, no—the movement rules state that you can't reverse unless it's the first move with a NONE direction. Since the current direction is LEFT, moving RIGHT next would be reversing, which isn't allowed. Therefore, after moving LEFT (which isn't possible here), you can't move RIGHT in the next step.

But since moving LEFT or UP from the head's position leads to death, perhaps the snake needs to change direction initially. Wait, but the initial direction is LEFT, so changing direction on the first move might not be allowed unless it's NONE.

Wait, no—on the first move, if the current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT or DOWN as they would reverse the direction. So the only possible moves on the first turn are UP, LEFT, or NONE.

But moving LEFT from (0,9) causes a collision, and moving UP also causes a collision. So the snake has no safe move on the first turn if it's stuck with direction constraints. That seems like a problem because the snake can't proceed towards the apple without causing an immediate death.

This suggests that there is no possible way for the snake to reach the apple in this configuration. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any other options.

Wait, perhaps the snake can move DOWN from (0,9) without reversing since it's a different direction. Let me check: the current direction is LEFT, so moving DOWN would be a change in direction but not a reversal. Reversing only occurs when the direction changes from UP to DOWN or DOWN to UP, and similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So moving DOWN from (0,9) would take the snake to (0,8). Is that allowed? Yes, because it's within the grid bounds. Then, on the next move, the current direction would be DOWN, so the snake can't reverse by moving UP or LEFT again unless it's the first move.

Wait, but after the first move, the direction is now DOWN, so any subsequent moves must not reverse. So from (0,8), if the snake continues moving DOWN, it could go to (0,7), and so on, but that doesn't seem helpful because the apple is at y=3, which is below y=9.

Wait, no—the apple is at (8,3), which is in the lower part of the grid. So the snake needs to move down to reach it. Moving DOWN seems like a viable path, but I need to see if there's any collision with body segments or walls.

But wait, let me consider that after moving DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8), the new direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP. It can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If the snake continues moving DOWN, it would go to (0,7), then (0,6), etc., all the way down to y=3 at (0,3). But that's only 6 moves, but the apple is at (8,3), so the x-coordinate needs to increase from 0 to 8.

But if the snake is moving DOWN along the y-axis, it's not moving towards higher x-values. So perhaps after reaching y=3, the snake would need to move RIGHT to reach x=8, but that might cause issues with body segments or walls.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can change direction after some moves to start moving RIGHT once it's at a certain point.

But I also need to consider the body segments. The current body is [(1,9), (1,8), ..., (5,8)]. So as the snake moves down from (0,9) to (0,8), it's moving into areas that are not blocked by its own body, which is good.

However, when the snake starts moving RIGHT from (0,3), it needs to make sure that each new position doesn't collide with any part of its body, including the segments that will shift as it moves.

Also, after eating the apple, the snake's body grows, so I need to ensure that there's space for it to do so without getting trapped.

Another consideration is the initial move. Since moving LEFT or UP causes immediate death, the only safe move on the first turn is to move DOWN or NONE (if allowed). Wait, but the initial direction is LEFT, so can we choose a different direction?

According to the rules, if the current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed. But in this case, the current direction is LEFT, not NONE. So the only possible moves on the first turn are UP, LEFT, or NONE (if applicable). Since moving LEFT and UP cause immediate death, perhaps the only safe option is to do nothing? Or wait, can we choose "NONE" as a move?

Wait, no—each move must be one of the valid directions. So if the current direction is LEFT, you can't choose NONE unless it's your first turn with direction NONE. But in this case, the initial direction is LEFT, so I think moving NONE isn't allowed unless the snake hasn't moved yet.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me recheck the rules.

Rule 2: Cannot reverse direction on the first move. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT or DOWN. But since moving LEFT from (0,9) would cause death, perhaps the snake has to choose another direction that doesn't reverse.

Wait, but if you're on your first turn and direction is LEFT, any non-reversing direction is allowed. So from LEFT, you can move UP, LEFT, or NONE? Or maybe just UP or DOWN?

No—the movement rules say: "Cannot reverse direction on the first move." Reversal is defined as changing direction in a way that would make it impossible for the snake to proceed further without immediate collision.

So if current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT or DOWN next because those would require reversing. But moving UP wouldn't reverse; it's a different direction. Similarly, moving NONE isn't allowed unless it's your first move with direction NONE.

Wait, but in this case, the snake has to make a move, so it must choose either LEFT, UP, RIGHT, or DOWN, but cannot reverse. So from LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT or DOWN. So possible moves are LEFT (which is impossible as it causes death), UP (also impossible), or NONE.

Wait, but NONE isn't a direction—probably, the only directions allowed are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. So perhaps the snake cannot make any move that doesn't cause an immediate death if it's stuck with direction constraints.

This suggests that there is no safe path because moving in any direction would either cause an immediate collision or reversal, leading to certain death.

But that can't be right—surely there's a way out. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the snake doesn't have to immediately move towards the apple but can navigate around the body segments and then change direction later without reversing.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8), it can start moving RIGHT towards x=8 while also going down further. But that would require checking each step for collisions.

Let me try to map this out:

1. First move: (0,9) → (0,8). Direction is now DOWN.
2. Next moves: Continue moving DOWN to (0,7), (0,6), etc., until y=3 at (0,3).
3. Then, change direction to RIGHT to go towards x=8.

But after each step, the snake's body segments will shift, so I need to ensure that none of them block the path.

Also, when the snake reaches (5,3), it might have enough space to eat the apple at (8,3).

Wait, but moving from (0,3) to (8,3) would require 8 moves to the RIGHT, each time checking for collisions with body segments or walls.

Additionally, after eating the apple, the snake's body will grow by one segment. So I need to make sure that when it eats the apple at (8,3), there's enough space to add a new segment without causing any collisions.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to see if it's possible step by step.

First, moving DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8):

- At each step: y decreases by 1.
- Body segments at (1,9), (1,8), ..., (5,8).
- So as the snake moves down, its head is at (0,y+1), and the body follows.

After moving to (0,8), the next move would be to (0,7), but let's check if any of these positions are blocked by the body.

The snake's body is currently from (1,9) down to (5,8). So at y=8, x=1 is part of the body. As the snake moves to (0,8), it's safe because that position isn't blocked.

Similarly, moving down further:

- (0,7): Not blocked by any body segments.
- Continue until reaching (0,3).

At this point, the snake is at (0,3). Now, it needs to move RIGHT towards x=8. Let's see how many steps that would be: 8 moves from x=0 to x=8.

But in each of these steps, we need to ensure that the new position isn't blocked by any part of the snake's body or walls.

Assuming the snake moves RIGHT one step at a time:

1. (0,3) → (1,3)
2. (1,3) → (2,3)
...
8. (7,3) → (8,3)

At each of these positions, we need to check if there's any part of the snake's body that would block it.

But wait, the snake's body is at x=1 to 5, y=3? No—the body starts at (1,9) and moves down. So at y=3, their x-coordinates are from 1 to 5.

Therefore, when the head is moving along y=3 from x=0 to x=8, it will pass through positions that are not blocked by its own body because the body is on higher y-values.

But wait, after the snake has moved down to (0,3), each subsequent move to the RIGHT would add a new segment. So when the head moves to (1,3), the tail is at (5,8). There's no overlap yet.

As it continues moving right:

- At (7,3), the tail would be somewhere around y=3 - (length of body + new segments added).

Wait, this might get tricky. Let me think about how the snake's body shifts as it moves.

Each time the snake moves, its head moves in a direction, and each segment follows the one in front of it. So after moving down to (0,3), the body is from (1,9) down to (5,8). Then, when the snake starts moving RIGHT:

- The head moves to (1,3), then (2,3), etc.
- Each time, a new segment is added at the front.

After 8 moves, the head reaches (8,3). But in this case, after each move, the tail is still at some lower x-position because it's moving right. Wait, no—the tail doesn't change until the snake retracts or grows.

Wait, when the snake moves, the head goes forward, and each segment follows. So after each step to the RIGHT, the body shifts accordingly.

But I'm not sure if this would cause any collision with existing segments. It seems like as long as there's enough space, it can move right without colliding.

Additionally, at (8,3), when the snake eats the apple, it gains a new segment, which would be added to the front of its body. So now, the tail is at (8-1,3) = (7,3). But since the snake has been moving from x=0 to x=8, this might cause some issues with overlapping segments.

Wait, let's think about the positions:

Before eating the apple:

- Head is at (8,3)
- Body segments from (7,3) back to (0,3)

After eating the apple, a new segment is added at the head, making the new head at (9,3), which is within bounds. The tail moves forward one position to (7,3).

But wait, before eating, the body was at x=0 up to x=8 (head). After adding a segment, the head is at x=9, but the snake can't go beyond x=9 because that's the maximum.

Wait, no—the new head would be at (8+1,3) = (9,3), which is still within bounds. The tail moves from (0,3) to (7,3). So no collision occurs here.

Therefore, it seems possible for the snake to reach (8,3), eat the apple, and survive without causing any collisions.

So putting it all together:

1. First move: (0,9) → (0,8) [DOWN]
2. Continue moving DOWN until (0,3)
3. Then move RIGHT step by step from (0,3) to (8,3)
4. Eat the apple at (8,3), adding a new segment
5. Survive without reversing or causing collisions

This seems feasible. Therefore, there is a path for the snake to reach the apple.

But wait, let me double-check if any steps cause collisions.

When moving down from (0,9) to (0,3):

- At each y=8,7,...,4,3: No collision because body is at higher y's and lower x's.

When moving right from (0,3) to (8,3):

- Each x=1,2,...,8: No collision with the body segments that are still at y=3 and lower x's.

After eating the apple:

- New head at (9,3), which is valid.
- Tail moves from (0,3) to (7,3): So no overlap.

Yes, this seems safe. Therefore, the snake can indeed reach the apple by moving DOWN as far as possible, then RIGHT towards x=8, and finally eat the apple without reversing or causing any collisions.

So the steps would be:

1. Move DOWN from (0,9) to (0,3)
2. Move RIGHT from (0,3) to (8,3)
3. Eat the apple at (8,3)

This path avoids any immediate reversals and doesn't cause any collisions with walls or body segments.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple by moving downward along its current column until it reaches y=3, then moving rightward towards x=8, ensuring no collision occurs with its own body. After eating the apple at (8,3), it survives without issues.

**Answer:** The snake can successfully eat the apple by moving down to y=3 and then right to x=8, avoiding collisions. The final answer is \boxed{(8, 3)}.
