<think>
Alright, let's tackle this Snake problem. The head is at (9,0), which is the top-right corner of the grid, and the apple is at (5,4). I need to plan a path from (9,0) to (5,4) without the snake colliding with its body or going out of bounds.

First, let's understand the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction immediately. Since it's currently moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. Also, after each move, the head becomes part of the body, and the tail moves unless an apple is eaten.

Looking at the body cells: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)]. So the snake's body is a long line from (4,0) to (8,0). The head is at (9,0), so the body extends back towards (8,0).

The apple is at (5,4), which is above and to the left of the current head. To get there, the snake needs to move LEFT several times and then UP.

But wait, from (9,0), moving LEFT would take it into the body. So I need to make sure that when moving LEFT, the new position doesn't collide with any part of the body except for possibly the last segment if it's about to eat an apple.

Wait, but initially, the snake is at (9,0). If I move DOWN first, but wait, the current direction is RIGHT. Wait, no—the current direction is given as RIGHT. Oh no, the initial direction is RIGHT. So according to rule 3, the next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction. Because moving from RIGHT to LEFT is reversing.

Wait, no. The movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction. Reversing means if it's going UP, can't go DOWN next; same for other directions. Since current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. So the first move must be either UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But moving RIGHT again would take the head to (10,0), which is out of bounds—so that's invalid. So from (9,0), the possible moves are UP or DOWN.

But wait, let me check: current direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT. So first move options are RIGHT, but moving right would take x to 10, which is invalid. So actually, no—can't move RIGHT because it's at x=9 and moving further right goes out of bounds. So the only valid moves after direction RIGHT are UP or DOWN.

Wait, but current direction is RIGHT, so next move can be any except LEFT. Wait, rule 3 says "cannot reverse direction"—if going UP, can't go DOWN; if going LEFT, can't go RIGHT; etc. So from RIGHT, next move can be RIGHT (but that would take it out of bounds), UP, or DOWN.

But moving UP from (9,0) is possible—it's y+1 to (9,1). Or moving DOWN would take it to (9,-1), which is invalid.

So initial move options: only UP.

Wait, but moving UP is allowed because it doesn't reverse direction. So first move must be UP to (9,1).

After that, the new head is at (9,1), and the body will shift: the tail moves forward unless an apple is eaten. But in this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so the tail would move.

Wait, but in the initial state, the snake's body is [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)]. So when moving UP from (9,0) to (9,1), the new head is at (9,1). Then the body would add this as a new segment. But wait, no—each move adds the new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, correction: when you make a move, the new head is added, and the tail is removed if there's no apple eaten. If you eat an apple, the body grows by one (so tail isn't removed).

But in this case, we are trying to reach the apple at (5,4). So until we eat it, each move will cause the tail to shrink.

Wait, but when planning the path, I have to make sure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body except possibly the last segment if moving towards eating the apple.

But this seems complex. Let's try to outline a possible path:

1. Start at (9,0), direction RIGHT.
2. First move can't be LEFT (can't reverse). So possible moves: UP or DOWN. But moving DOWN would take y to -1, which is invalid. So first move must be UP.

So move 1: UP → (9,1).

Now, the body segments are updated: the head is now at (9,1), and the tail (the last segment) moves forward unless an apple is eaten. Since we haven't eaten yet, the tail would move from (8,0) to (9,0). Wait no—the snake's movement adds the new head and removes the tail each time unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, let me clarify:

- Each move: new head = current head + direction vector.
- The body segments are updated by adding the new head at the front.
- If apple isn't eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed. So the length remains the same.

So after moving UP to (9,1), the body becomes [(9,1)] + previous body except the tail.

Wait no—the body is a list of segments excluding the head. So initial body is given as [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)]. The head is at (9,0). When moving UP, the new head is (9,1).

So the new body would be [(9,1)] followed by all previous body segments except the last one? Or wait, no—each move shifts the entire body towards the head.

Wait, perhaps I should model the snake's movement step by step to avoid collisions.

Let me outline each possible move and track the body:

Current state:

Head: (9,0)

Body: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)]

Apple at (5,4).

First move must be UP because can't reverse direction from RIGHT to LEFT.

So after moving UP:

New head: (9,1)

Body becomes [(9,1)] + previous body except the last segment, but wait no. The body is all segments excluding the head. So when you move, each body segment moves forward one step towards the new head.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of the snake as a list where each part follows the next.

In this case, after moving UP from (9,0) to (9,1), the new body segments are:

The previous body is [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)]. The head was at (9,0). Now, moving UP to (9,1).

So the new body would be:

The previous segments all move one step towards the new head. Wait no—the entire snake moves by each segment following the next.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the movement as follows: after moving, the new head is added at the front, and the tail (if not growing) is removed from the end.

So initial body: [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0) ]

After moving UP to (9,1):

The new head is (9,1). The body becomes [(9,1), (4,3), (4,2), ..., (8,0)]? No, that doesn't make sense. Actually, each segment moves towards the next one.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the snake as a list where each part follows the previous. So when you move UP, all body segments follow in order.

So moving from (9,0) UP to (9,1):

The new head is at (9,1).

Each body segment moves into the position of the next segment.

So:

- The first body segment after the head was (4,3). It would move towards (9,1)? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about how the snake moves in the game:

When you move the head, each part of the body follows in sequence. So if the head is at (x,y), and it moves to (x+dx, y+dy), then each segment after that takes the position of the previous one.

So for example, with a body like [A, B, C], when moving forward, A becomes the new position of B, B becomes C, and so on. The head is added at the front, and if not growing, the tail (last element) is removed.

In our case:

After first move UP to (9,1), the body segments would be:

The previous segments are [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)]. So when moving up, each of these segments will move one step towards the new head.

Wait no—that's not how it works. Each segment moves into the position of the previous segment. So for example, if the snake is in a straight line, like [A, B], and you move forward, A takes B's place, and B is removed if not growing.

But in our case, after moving UP from (9,0) to (9,1), the body segments will each move towards the new head. So the first segment (4,3) would move to (5,3), but that doesn't make sense because it's far away.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the snake moves. The body follows in order, so each part of the body takes the position of the previous part. So if the head is at (9,1), and the next segment was at (4,3), then after moving UP, that segment would move to where the head was, which is (9,0). But that can't be right because it's a different direction.

Wait no—the body segments follow in order. So if the snake is straight, each part moves into the position of the previous part. So for example:

Head at H, then B1, B2, ..., Bn as body segments.

When moving forward, the new head is H', and each Bi becomes the position of Bi-1.

So in our initial state:

Head: (9,0)

Body segments: [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0) ]

So when moving UP to (9,1):

The new head is H' = (9,1).

Then the body segments update as follows:

B1: (4,3) → moves to (9,0)

But wait, that can't be right because it's a straight line. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps each segment in the body list is ordered from head to tail. Wait no—the initial description says "body cells" are excluding the head. So the body list is [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)], which suggests that these are in order from closest to farthest from the head.

So after moving UP, each body segment moves one step towards the new head's direction. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to realize that the snake is currently a long line starting at (4,3) down to (8,0), with the head at (9,0). So the snake is moving to the right, but the body is in a vertical line from (4,0) to (8,0).

Wait no—the initial direction is RIGHT. So the head is at (9,0), and the body extends left towards (8,0). Because when you move right, each segment follows.

So if the snake was moving right, the head is at (9,0), then (8,0) is next, then (7,0), etc., down to (4,0). Then above that, we have (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).

Wait, so the body is a vertical line from (4,3) down to (4,0), then a horizontal line from (4,0) to (8,0). So it's like an L-shape.

So when moving UP from (9,0), the head goes to (9,1). Now, the body segments will shift:

- The previous head was at (9,0), which is now part of the body.
- Each segment moves forward. So the first body segment after the head was (8,0). It would move into (9,0).
- Then (7,0) moves to (8,0), and so on.

But wait, this seems like a lot of segments moving in different directions, which could cause collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model each step carefully:

1. Current position: head at (9,0). Direction is RIGHT.

2. First move must be UP or DOWN. But can't reverse to LEFT because that would be reversing from RIGHT. So options are UP and DOWN. Moving DOWN to (9,-1) is invalid, so only UP is possible.

Move 1: UP → head at (9,1). Now, the body segments will update:

- The new head is (9,1).
- The previous body was [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0) ].
- So the body now becomes [(9,1)] plus all previous body segments except the last one, but no—because each segment moves forward.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that after moving UP, each segment shifts:

The new head is at (9,1). The previous head was at (9,0), which is now part of the body. Then the next segment was (8,0), which moves into (9,0). Then (7,0) moves to (8,0), etc.

So after moving UP, the new body segments are:

[ (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]

Wait no—that can't be right because the body list excludes the head. So after moving, the new body is:

[ (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), ..., (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]

But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to ignore the exact movement and focus on whether the new head position is safe. After moving UP, the head is at (9,1). Is this position occupied by any body segment?

In the initial state, the body segments are from (4,3) down to (8,0), so (9,1) is not among them. So it's safe.

Now, move 2: After moving UP to (9,1), what can we do next? We were moving in direction RIGHT before, but after moving UP, the direction changes? Or does the snake continue in the same direction until a key is pressed?

Wait, in most snake games, the direction remains the same unless the player presses another key. So from initial direction RIGHT, if I move UP as the first step, that would change the direction to UP.

But wait, no—usually, you can't reverse direction immediately; you have to turn left or right. But perhaps in this problem, any direction is allowed except reversing (since it's impossible to move in the opposite direction in one step).

Alternatively, perhaps each movement changes the direction unless the same key is pressed again.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that after moving UP once from RIGHT, the new direction is UP.

So now, the snake is moving UP with head at (9,1). Next move could be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, except for the opposite direction (DOWN would be reverse of UP, which may not be allowed).

But to avoid collision, we have to make sure that the next position isn't occupied by any body segment.

So let's plan a path:

Move 1: UP → (9,1). Body segments are now from (9,0) up to (4,3), but in what order?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each step and check for collisions.

After moving UP to (9,1):

- The new head is at (9,1).
- The previous body was [(4,3), (4,2), ..., (8,0)]. So after moving, the body segments become:

[ (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]

Wait, that makes sense. The head was at (9,0); moving UP to (9,1). So the body segments now are:

- The previous head (now part of body): (9,0)
- Then the next segment: (8,0) moves to (9,0)
- Wait no—each segment follows the one in front.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that after moving, each segment takes the position of the previous segment. So:

- New head: (9,1)
- Previous body segments: [B1, B2, ..., B8]

After moving, B1 becomes where the old head was (9,0). Then B2 becomes where B1 was, etc.

So after move 1:

Body segments are now [ (9,0), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0) ]

Wait no—that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the body list remains as is but each segment follows.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The goal is to move the snake from (9,0) towards (5,4). The apple is at (5,4).

So we need a path that moves the head from (9,0) up and left to reach (5,4), avoiding collision with body segments.

After moving UP once to (9,1):

Next steps could be:

Move LEFT → (8,1)

But check if any body segment is at (8,1). The body after first move is:

[ (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), ..., (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]

So (8,1) is not in the body, so it's safe.

Move 2: LEFT → (8,1)

Now, new head at (8,1). Body segments:

[ (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), ..., (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]

Wait, but after moving left to (8,1), the body segments shift again.

So new head is at (8,1). Previous head was at (9,1). Now, the body segments are:

[ (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), ..., (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]

But after moving left, each segment follows:

So previous body segments become [(9,0), (8,0), (7,0), ..., (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]

Wait no—each segment moves into the position of the previous one.

I think I'm stuck trying to model the exact positions. Maybe a better approach is to find a path that doesn't collide with itself.

The snake needs to move from (9,0) up and left to reach (5,4). The body is currently in an L-shape: vertical line at x=4 from y=0 to 3, then horizontal line at y=0 from x=4 to x=8, then the head at (9,0).

So after moving UP once, the snake turns up towards (9,1), and the body starts shifting upwards.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to make a U-turn. Since the snake is initially moving right, it can turn up or down. But turning down would go into invalid territory. So first move must be UP.

After moving UP once, then LEFT multiple times to get to x=5, then DOWN to y=4.

But let me outline step by step:

Move 1: UP → (9,1)

Now, body segments are from (9,0) up to (4,3).

Next, move LEFT to (8,1). Check if (8,1) is in the body. Body after first move includes (8,0), but not (8,1), so safe.

Move 2: LEFT → (8,1)

Body segments now are:

[ (9,0), (8,0), ..., (4,0), (4,1), ... ]

Wait no—after moving left to (8,1), the previous head (9,1) is part of body. So body includes (9,1), then (8,1). But after moving left, the segments shift.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that this approach may take too long and instead think of a possible path.

Another idea: The snake needs to move up 4 steps in y-direction and left 4 steps in x-direction. So from (9,0), move up to (9,1), then left to (5,1), then down to (5,0) is invalid because body is there? Or wait.

Alternatively:

Move 1: UP → (9,1)

Move 2: LEFT → (8,1)

Move 3: LEFT → (7,1)

Move 4: LEFT → (6,1)

Move 5: LEFT → (5,1)

Now head is at (5,1). Now need to move down to reach y=4.

But moving down from (5,1) would go into (5,0), which is part of the body. So can't do that immediately.

Alternatively, after reaching (5,1), perhaps move up further:

Move 6: UP → (5,2)

Now at (5,2). Then check again.

But this might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe a better path is to go all the way up first.

From (9,0):

Move 1: UP → (9,1)

Move 2: UP → (9,2)

Move 3: UP → (9,3)

Move 4: UP → (9,4). Now head at (9,4), which is above the apple. Then move left four times to reach (5,4).

But let's check if this path causes any collision.

After moving up four times:

Each move up would cause the body to shift upwards, so after each step, we need to ensure that the new head isn't colliding with the body.

Move 1: UP → (9,1). Body is now [ (9,0), (8,0), ..., (4,0), (4,1), ... ].

Move 2: UP → (9,2). Check if any body segment is at (9,2). Initially, no. So safe.

Body after move 2: [ (9,1), (8,0), ..., ]

Wait no—each time we move up, the previous head becomes part of the body. So after each move, the head moves up, and the body follows.

After move 4: UP → (9,4). Now, check if any collision.

Body segments would be:

From initial position, moving up four times would cause the body to extend upward while shifting.

But I'm not sure about the exact positions. However, assuming that each move is safe as long as the new head isn't on a body segment, and considering that moving straight up from (9,0) to (9,4), then left to (5,4), seems feasible.

So total moves would be 4 ups and 4 lefts: 8 moves.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try another approach.

Another idea is to move in a square path around the apple.

From (9,0):

Move UP → (9,1)

Move LEFT → (8,1)

Move DOWN → but that would go back to (8,0), which may be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe moving up and then right? No, because right is the initial direction.

Wait, perhaps it's better to make a U-turn by turning left after moving up once.

From (9,0):

Move UP → (9,1). Now direction is UP.

Then, turn LEFT (which would be towards decreasing x) to start moving left.

So move LEFT to (8,1), then continue moving left until reach x=5.

Now at (5,1). Then, need to move down to y=4. But (5,0) is part of the body.

Wait, but perhaps if we go up more first before turning.

Alternatively, after reaching (9,1), turn LEFT and start moving left until x=5, then move down.

But when trying to move down from (5,1), will it collide?

Because the body may have moved into that area.

I think the key is to find a path where the head doesn't enter any square occupied by its own body.

Given that, perhaps the minimal number of moves is 8: up 4 times and left 4 times, then down once? Or maybe more.

Wait, no—if you go straight up four times to (9,4), then move left four times to (5,4). That's 8 moves. The head would be at the apple without colliding with body.

But let me think about how the body shifts.

Each time the snake moves, the head moves and the body follows, so each segment takes the place of the one in front.

So after moving up once:

Head: (9,1)

Body: (9,0), then previous segments.

After moving up again:

Head: (9,2)

Body: (9,1), (9,0), ...

Continue until head is at (9,4). At this point, the body would be from (9,3) down to initial positions. So no collision yet.

Then move left four times:

First left move: (8,4). Safe because body hasn't reached there yet.

Second left: (7,4)

Third: (6,4)

Fourth: (5,4). Now, head is at apple.

So total moves: 4 up, 4 left = 8 moves.

But wait—when moving from (9,4) to (5,4), the body would be following. So during each move left, the head moves and body shifts.

After first left move:

Head: (8,4)

Body: (9,4), (9,3), ..., etc.

So no collision.

Therefore, 8 moves in total.
</think>

The snake needs to move from (9,0) up to (5,4). The optimal path is to move straight up four times and then left four times. Each move is safe as it avoids the body segments. Therefore, the minimal number of steps required is eight.

\boxed{8}
