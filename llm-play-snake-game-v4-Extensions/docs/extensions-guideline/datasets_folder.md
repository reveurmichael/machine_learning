## VITAL: datasets folder naming/placement

TODO: Things might have changed. It's in ongoing discussion. Make we have made a decison on this logs folder and file naming conventions. Maybe, or maybe not. You have to double check.


VITAL: THIS ONE IS VERY IMPORTANT. It's a single-source-of-truth documentation â€“ applies to **all** extensions.

IMPORTANT FILE THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER IGNORE.




The grid_size should not be fixed to 10, because generated datasets (json files/folders, csv files/folders, jsonl files/folders, etc.) will be stored in ./logs/extensions/datasets/grid-size-N. Make a clear rule and maybe write some python code (maybe OOP Abstract CLass that should be implemented by all extensions blabla-v0.0N? Config constants? Validation mechanism? do it in common folder) for enforcing your rule.

Datasets generated by the heuristics/ML/DL will be stored in ./extensions/datasets/grid-size-N/blabla_v0.0.N_timestamps folder



Check this for all heuristics extensions:
- heuristics-v0.01
- heuristics-v0.02
- heuristics-v0.03
- heuristics-v0.04

Check this for all supervized learning extensions:
- supervized-v0.01
- supervized-v0.02
- supervized-v0.03

Check this for all reinforcement learning extensions:
- reinforcement-v0.01
- reinforcement-v0.02
