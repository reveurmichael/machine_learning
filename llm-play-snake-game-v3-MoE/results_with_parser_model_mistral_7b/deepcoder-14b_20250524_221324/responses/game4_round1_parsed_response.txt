{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake can die by immediately turning around after its first move. To avoid this, we move it 2 steps right (to reach position 7) to ensure it cannot turn back without moving out of the grid. Then, we move it up twice and left once to approach the apple at (0, 0). Finally, we move down to ensure the snake doesn't collide with its own body."}
