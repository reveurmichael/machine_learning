========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this classic Snake game problem. The snake starts at position (2,1) and needs to reach the apple at (2,7). Let me break down what's given and figure out a path.

First, the snake's head is at (2,1), which is on the bottom row since y=1 in a 0-based system where top-right is (9,9). The apple is directly above it along the same x-coordinate. So moving up seems like the way to go, but I need to plan carefully.

Looking at the movement rules, the snake can't reverse direction immediately. Since it's currently facing "UP", it can't turn down on its next move unless it was previously not facing up. Wait, no—the rule says you can't reverse direction from UP, meaning you can't face DOWN if your current is UP? Or does it mean you can't change from UP to DOWN because they are opposite? Hmm, the example in the problem shows that when the snake moves right and then right again, but I think the main point is once you're facing a certain direction, you have limited choices.

The body cells given are just [(2,0)], which means the tail is at (2,0). So currently, the snake's length is 3: head at (2,1), body at (2,0) and that's it. Wait no—the body list excludes the head and goes from behind to tail. So in this case, [(2,0)] means the tail is at (2,0). So the full snake would be [head=(2,1), BODY1=(2,0)], but without any other body cells.

Wait, let me think again: the body list has [(2,0)]. So the head is followed by (2,0), which is the tail. So the snake's current length is 2: head and one segment at (2,0). Wait no—the description says "Body cells: [ (2,0) ]"—so that's only one cell after the head? Or does it include the tail? The problem states that in body cells, it goes from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the snake is longer, it would have more segments.

But here, the body list has [(2,0)], which means the next position behind the head is (2,0). So the snake's length is 3: head at (2,1), then (2,0) as the first body segment. Wait no—because if you look at the example given, S = [ (4,4), (4,3), etc. ] where each subsequent element is a step back from the head. So in our case, the snake's head is at (2,1), and then the next position behind is (2,0). But that would make it a 2-segment snake? Or maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait no—the body list excludes the head but includes all other segments from the tail. So if the snake has only one segment after the head at (2,0), then the full S is [head=(2,1), (2,0)]—so length 2? That seems too short for a normal game.

But perhaps in this problem, it's acceptable to have such a small snake. Anyway, moving forward: since the apple is directly above at (2,7). But wait no—the head is at (2,1), and the apple is at (2,7)—wait that would mean the apple is 6 units above? Because y increases as we go down.

Wait in the coordinate system given, UP is +y. So from (2,1), moving up to (2,2) is one step. To reach (2,7), which is at a higher y value than 1, that would actually be going DOWN because UP is towards increasing y and DOWN decreases y.

Wait wait no: in the problem statement, it says "UP" means (0, +1). So moving from (x,y) to (x, y+1) is UP. But since (2,7) has a higher y than (2,1), but that's only if we consider 0 as the top and increasing y going down—no, wait in grid coordinates, usually bottom-left is (0,0). Wait no: problem says "bottom-left" is (0,0) and top-right is (9,9). So moving up increases y towards 9. So from (2,1), moving UP would go to (2,2), then (2,3), etc., but the apple is at (2,7), which is higher in y—so actually it's moving DOWN because in terms of grid position, lower y is upward.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The head is at (2,1) and needs to reach (2,7). Since 7 > 1, but according to the coordinate system, UP increases y. So from (2,1), moving UP would take us closer to higher y values towards (2,9), not down.

Wait no: wait in grid terms, if bottom-left is (0,0) and top-right is (9,9), then increasing x moves rightward, decreasing x moves leftward. For y, increasing means going upward from the bottom.

So moving UP increases y by 1 each step. So from (2,1), moving UP once gets to (2,2). To get to (2,7), we need to move UP six times.

But wait, looking at the apple position given in the problem: it's actually (2,7) according to the inputs—so that is higher than the head which is at (2,1). So moving UP would be required. But let me verify with the movement example provided:

In the first example, when S = [ (4,4), (4,3), ... ] and direction RIGHT: new_head becomes (5,4). Wait no—the example says when current head is at (5,5) and moving right to (6,5).

Wait that seems contradictory. Oh wait in that movement example, the snake was moved from x=5,y=5 with a direction of RIGHT, so new_head is (5+1, 5)=(6,5). But according to the coordinate system, this would mean moving right increases x.

Yes, because "RIGHT" means adding +1 to x. So in that example, moving right was correctly handled as per coordinates.

So for our problem: head at (2,1), needs to move UP six times to reach y=7 from y=1, while keeping the same x of 2—so no lateral movement needed except if there are obstacles.

But let's check with the rules. The required path must have a number of RIGHT and LEFT moves equal to zero, since we're moving straight up. So the move list should consist solely of "UP" directions six times.

However, I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause any collision or body overlap.

Let me plan step by step:

1. Starting position: (2,1). Body is at (2,0).

So current snake length is 3? Wait no—body cells are [(2,0)], so the full S is [head=(2,1), (2,0)]. So it's a two-segment snake.

Wait that seems odd. But perhaps in this specific case, it is allowed.

For each move:

- Move UP to (2,2). Check for collision: new_head at (2,2) should not be in any body except when moving into the tail if we are eating an apple. But since we haven't eaten yet, check if (2,2) is occupied by any body segments.

Body list before move is [(2,0)]. So head moves from (2,1) to (2,2). Insert old head at front: new body list becomes [(2,1), (2,0)]. Since we're not eating the apple yet, remove tail—tail was (2,0), so after removal, body is just [(2,1)].

But wait no—if we aren't eating, then:

After inserting old head, the body becomes [new_head, ... , tail]. Then if it's not an apple move, we remove the last element—the current tail.

So initial snake: [head=(2,1), (2,0)]. When moving UP to (2,2):

- Insert (2,1) at front → [(2,1), (2,0)].
- Since no apple, remove tail → [(2,1)] becomes the new body? Wait that would make the snake length 2 again: head and one body cell.

Wait this is confusing. Maybe I should model each step more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with moving up each time and check if there are any collisions or body overlaps.

But first, let me consider possible obstacles:

The current snake occupies (2,1) and (2,0). So the next move UP would make the head at (2,2), which is empty. Then inserting (2,1) in front of [(2,0)], so the new body list becomes [(2,1), (2,0)]. Since it's not an apple move, we remove tail → [(2,1)].

Wait no—that would make the snake have only one segment again. That seems odd but maybe possible given that the snake is very short.

Continuing:

Move 1: UP to (2,2). Body becomes [ (2,2), (2,1) ] then remove tail → [(2,2)]? Wait no—that can't be right because we have two segments.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding how body updating works. The process is:

a. Insert old head at front of BODY list.
b. If not apple: remove tail.

So initial S: [ (2,1) (head), (2,0) (body) ]

Move 1:
- new_head = UP → (2,2)
- Check collision: no, as (2,2) is empty.
- Insert old head (2,1) at front of body list [(2,0)] → [ (2,1), (2,0) ]
- Since not apple move, remove tail (2,0) → new body list is [ (2,1) ]

Wait but now the snake has only one segment? That can't be right because each move appends a new head and removes a tail.

Wait no—that's impossible. The snake must have at least two segments since it starts with [(2,0)] as body cells—so including head, that would make length 3: [ (2,1), (2,0) ]? Wait but the problem says "Body cells list excludes the head"—so if there are no other cells besides (2,0), then the full snake is just two segments.

So moving step by step:

Current S = [head=(2,1), body=(2,0)]

Move UP to (2,2):
- Insert new_head (2,1) at front → [(2,1), (2,0)]
- Since it's not an apple move, remove tail (2,0). Now body is [(2,1)].

But then the snake has only one segment—so when moving again:

Next move UP to (2,3):
- Insert head=(2,1) at front → [(2,1), ... ] but since previous body was [(2,1)], inserting makes it [ (2,1), (2,1) ]? Wait no—that would mean a double segment.

Wait that's impossible; the snake cannot have two cells in the same position. So collision has occurred, which is invalid.

Therefore, moving UP directly from (2,1) to (2,2) and so on will result in overlapping segments because the body list after first move becomes [ (2,1) ] again if we remove the tail—so when moving next time, inserting head leads back to same position.

This suggests that the initial body is [(2,0)] which means the snake's length is 3: head and two body cells. Wait no—because S = [head] + body segments from behind. So in this case, if S is just [ (2,1), (2,0) ], then it's a two-segment snake.

But moving UP would require that the new_head doesn't conflict with existing positions.

Wait perhaps I made an error earlier—snake has length 3? Because body cells are given as [(2,0)], which is one cell. So head and one body segment: total of two segments?

No—if S includes all body parts from the tail backward, then if there's only one body part after head, that makes it a three-segment snake.

Wait I'm getting confused again. Maybe I should model this correctly:

The problem states:
"Body cells: [ (2,0) ] — meaning segments immediately behind the head are listed until the tail."

So for example, S = [head=5, 4; body1=5,3; body2=4,2; ... ; tail] So in our case:

If the snake has only one segment after head at (2,0), that means there's a tail as well. But perhaps the list is [(2,0)], implying that the tail is at (2,0) and the next behind is nothing—so maybe it's just two segments?

Wait no—the description says "from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail"—which includes all intermediate parts. So if body cells are [(2,0)], that means there's only one segment before the tail.

So in our case, S = [head=(2,1), (2,0)] and tail is also part of the body? Wait no—the problem says "Body cells: list from behind to tail"—so if you have a snake with head at A, then B, C,... Z—then the body cells would be [(B), ..., (Z)].

Therefore, in our case:

head = (2,1)
body = [ (2,0) ]
and since it's just one cell after head, that means there is no further body segments beyond (2,0). So perhaps the tail is at (2,0).

Wait but then if you have a two-segment snake: head and one body segment. When moving UP to (2,2), you insert (2,1) at front of [ (2,0) ] → [(2,1), (2,0)]. Then since it's not an apple move, remove tail→[(2,1)].

But then the snake becomes a single segment again. So when moving again:

new_head = UP from (2,1) to (2,2)
Insert head at front: [ (2,1), ... ]
Then remove tail → [ (2,1) ]

Which causes collision because we're trying to move into our own body.

So this suggests that starting with a two-segment snake is problematic for moving UP multiple times without overlapping itself. So perhaps the initial movement is not possible as it would cause an immediate collision unless some other condition allows it.

But wait in reality, can the snake make such a small U-turn?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that once you reach (2,7), which is at y=7 from head's current position of y=1. So 6 steps UP are needed.

So perhaps the movement sequence would be:

Move UP x times until reaching y=7.

But in order to do so without collision or self-overlapping, the snake must have enough space to move in that direction.

Is there any risk of collision?

Well, as long as (2,y) is empty for each step from y=1 up to 6. But since no other segments are present except at (2,0), and moving UP would require spaces above it—i.e., positions like (2,2), etc.—which aren't occupied.

Therefore, the snake can move straight up six times without any collision or self-overlap as long as each new head position is empty.

But according to our previous step-by-step simulation, after first move:

new_head = (2,2). Inserted at front of body list [(2,0)] → [ (2,1), (2,0) ]. Then since not apple, remove tail→[ (2,1) ]—wait that would make the snake a single segment again.

Wait this seems impossible. So how does the snake maintain its length?

Ah! I think my initial understanding of the process was incorrect. Let's re-examine:

The movement steps are:

After computing new_head:
- Insert the old head into the front of the body list.
- If it's not an apple move, remove the last element (tail).
So the snake's body is always the previous body segments plus the new head.

Wait no—the insertion adds the new head to the front. Then if you don't eat, you remove the tail—so the length remains the same as before?

No: because:

Original S = [head, B1, B2, ..., BN]

After movement:
new_head is computed.
new_S = [ new_head ] + old_S[0:-1]
Wait no—the insertion puts new_head at front of body list.

But wait in the problem statement it says:

When moving to a non-apple cell:

- Insert the head into the front.
- Remove tail.

So for each move, the snake's length remains same as before: because you're adding one segment and removing another. So if initial S is [H, B1], then after inserting H at front of [B1] → [H, B1]. Then remove tail→[H].

Wait that would make it a single segment again.

But in reality, the snake's length remains same because each move appends one head and removes one tail. So if you have N segments, you end up with N-1 + 1 = N segments? No—because you're inserting at front and removing from end, which is the same as a rotation.

Wait wait no: when moving to non-apple cell:

S becomes [new_head] followed by old body list minus last element. So if original S was length L, then after moving, it's still length L-1 + 1 = L—because you add one head and remove one tail.

So in our case, starting with S of [(2,1), (2,0)], a length of 2 segments:

Move to (2,2):

new_S becomes [ (2,1) ] after inserting at front of body list which was [(2,0)] → [ (2,1), (2,0) ]. Then remove tail→[ (2,1) ]

So new S is only one segment. But that's a problem because the snake can't have zero length.

Wait but in reality, for the initial movement step:

If you have a two-segment snake: head and body at (2,1), (2,0). You move UP to (2,2):

new_S = [ (2,2) ] + [(2,1)] → then remove tail→[ (2,2) ]

But that leaves the snake with only one segment. Which can't happen because it's moving into a new cell.

This suggests that our initial setup is invalid or perhaps my understanding of body cells is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe in this problem, the snake starts longer than I'm thinking—perhaps more segments are present beyond what's given.

But according to the problem statement: "Body cells: [ (2,0) ]". So only one cell after head. That would make the full S as:

[head=(2,1), body=(2,0)] and tail is somewhere else? Wait no—the description says "from behind the head to the tail"—so if you have a single body segment at (2,0), that must be adjacent to head—so [head= (2,1); next is (2,0); then tail].

Therefore, the full snake has three segments: H=(2,1), B1=(2,0), T= ?

Wait no—if there's only one body cell at (2,0), that would imply that the rest of the snake beyond B1 doesn't exist—so perhaps the S is:

[head=(2,1); then nothing else except tail], but I don't see where.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe it's better to approach this differently.

Assuming the initial body cells are [(2,0)], which includes all segments from behind head up to and including the tail—so for S:

If snake has two segments: H=(2,1), B1=(2,0), then there must be a tail beyond that. But since the problem only lists (2,0) as body cells, perhaps it's an oversight.

Alternatively, maybe the initial setup is such that the snake can move straight up without issues—assuming no self-overlap.

In practice, moving UP six times from (2,1) would require positions:

(2,2), then (2,3), ..., up to (2,7). Are these positions free? Since in our problem statement, it's a hypothetical scenario where the snake can make this move without any collision or block.

Therefore, perhaps ignoring self-collisions for now and assuming that moving straight is possible, the answer would be moving UP six times. However, since each move involves changing direction—perhaps turning around—is not feasible in minimal moves. But given the problem's constraints, we need to find a way.

But considering the movement step-by-step without collision:

Assuming after first move, head is at (2,2), body becomes [ (2,1) ]. Second move: UP → (2,3); body list was [(2,1)], inserting new_head gives [(2,2), (2,1)]; then remove tail→[(2,2)]. Third move: UP to (2,4); same process. So each time, after moving up and removing the tail, the snake's length remains 1? That can't be.

Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body is updated.

Perhaps when you insert at front of the body list and then remove from end, it's actually equivalent to a rotation—so the previous head becomes the new tail. So in this case:

Starting S = [H=(2,1), B=(2,0)] (length 2).

Move UP:
new_S = [H_new= (2,1), H_old=(2,1), then remove last → so [(2,1)], which is same as starting point.

Wait that can't be right. It seems like this setup is impossible—so perhaps the initial body configuration makes it impossible to move in certain directions without collision or overlapping with existing body parts.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about how the movement works for a longer snake.

Suppose the snake has more segments beyond (2,0). For example:

S = [H=(2,1), B1=(2,0), T=...], but since problem states that body cells are [(2,0)], then perhaps only two segments: H and B1. Then moving UP would require inserting new_head at front of [B1] → [new_head, B1]. Then remove tail—since it's not an apple move.

But if the snake is just two segments:

After first move:
S = [H=(2,1), B1= (2,0)] becomes after moving to (2,2):

Insert H=(2,1) at front → [ (2,2), (2,1) ]. Then remove tail→[(2,2)].

So S is now length 1: only head. But that's impossible—snake can't have zero segments.

This suggests that the initial body configuration may be such that moving in a certain direction would cause immediate collision or collapse into itself.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal number of moves isn't simply six UP steps—it might require some lateral movement to avoid overlapping with tail parts.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible only if we turn around first—like making a U-turn—but then turning would require enough space.

Given that from (2,1), moving left or right may create new opportunities.

But given the target is in y-direction at same x=2, perhaps moving UP all the way is feasible without collision as long as each step's position is empty.

Therefore, I think the minimal number of moves would be 6 steps UP. But considering that after each move except last one, the snake might collapse into itself—so it's impossible to move in a straight line if the body can't sustain the movement.

Wait but perhaps this scenario assumes that there are enough cells available for the entire movement without self-overlap—meaning the path is clear above and behind.

But according to problem statement, we don't have any other information about the grid. So maybe it's safe to assume that the snake has ample space beyond y=7 to move straight up.

In conclusion, perhaps moving UP six times would be sufficient, assuming no self-collisions or obstacles in the path.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine a sequence of moves for a snake starting at position (2,1) with its body cells given as [(2,0)]. The goal is to reach the target cell (2,7). 

### Approach
The key steps are:
1. **Understand the Movement**: The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each movement involves moving one step in a chosen direction.
2. **Body Update Rule**: After each move, if the new head position is not an apple (i.e., target cell with value 1), the snake's body segments are updated by removing the last segment (tail) and adding the new head at the front of the body list.
3. **Avoid Collision**: Ensure that moving in a direction does not cause self-collision, meaning the new head position should be empty.

Given the target is directly above the starting point on the same x-coordinate, we can move straight up without needing to change direction. Each step upwards involves:
- Moving the head one cell up.
- Updating the body by removing the tail and adding the new head at the front of the body list.
- Ensuring no collision occurs.

### Solution Code
```python
# Assuming the grid is empty except for the snake's body cells, which do not block movement upwards beyond (2,7)
moves = ['up'] * 6  # Moving up six times from y=1 to y=7

print(len(moves))
```

### Explanation
The solution involves moving the snake straight up six times. Starting at (2,1), each move takes the head one step upward until it reaches (2,7). The body segments are updated correctly by removing the tail and adding a new head segment after each move. Since no other cells on this path are occupied according to the problem setup, there is no risk of collision or self-overlap. Thus, the minimal number of moves required is six steps upwards.
