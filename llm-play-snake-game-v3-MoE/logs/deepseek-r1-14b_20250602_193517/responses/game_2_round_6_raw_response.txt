========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (9,0), which is the bottom-right corner of the grid, and the apple is at (7,5). The current direction is "DOWN", but according to the movement rules, we can't reverse our direction immediately. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. So our possible initial moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

Wait, no, actually, looking back at the problem statement: the snake's head is at (9,0), which is the bottom-left? Wait, no—the coordinates go from (0,0) as bottom-left to (9,9) as top-right. So (9,0) would be the bottom-right corner because x increases to the right and y increases upward.

So the snake's head is at the bottom-right, and the apple is at (7,5), which is somewhere in the middle of the grid but closer to the left side.

The body cells are [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)], so the snake's body extends downward from the head. That means the snake is currently a vertical line starting at (9,0) and going down to (9,5). Wait no—wait, if the head is at (9,0), then the next body cell is (9,1), which would be below it because y increases upward. So from (9,0), moving DOWN would take it towards higher y values? Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, in the coordinate system, "UP" means y+1, so moving up increases y. So (9,0) is the bottom-right corner, and moving UP would take us to (9,1), which is one step up. So the body cells are [(9,1), (9,2), etc., meaning that the snake's body is going upward from the head.

So right now, the snake is a vertical line stretching from (9,0) upwards to (9,5). The apple is at (7,5), which is two units to the left and five units up from the head. Wait, no: from (9,0) to (7,5), x decreases by 2, y increases by 5.

So the Manhattan distance between the head and the apple is |9-7| + |0-5| = 2+5=7. So we need a path that covers these steps without colliding with the body or going out of bounds.

First, let's consider the current direction: DOWN. The snake can't reverse, so it can't go UP next. But wait, no—the movement rules say you cannot choose the opposite direction. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait, the initial direction is "DOWN", and in the first move, we have to choose a direction that's not the reverse.

So from DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. Therefore, possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or perhaps NONE if allowed, but since the snake has to move towards the apple, probably moving LEFT or RIGHT is necessary.

But wait, the initial movement options: since we're at (9,0), which is the bottom-right corner, moving RIGHT would take us out of bounds because x can't exceed 9. So moving RIGHT from (9,0) is invalid—it's a collision. So our only possible first move is LEFT or DOWN? Wait, no—current direction is DOWN, so we have to choose a new direction that isn't UP.

Wait, the movement rules state that you can't reverse direction on the first move if current direction is not NONE. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next direction can't be UP. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN? Wait no—directions are only four: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

Wait, but moving in the same direction as before is allowed. Because reversing is not allowed, but continuing in the same direction is okay. So from DOWN, you can choose to continue going DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (but RIGHT would take us out of bounds).

So let's check possible first moves:

1. Moving LEFT: From (9,0), moving LEFT takes us to (8,0). Is this safe?

The body cells are [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)], so the segment immediately behind the head is (9,1). So after moving LEFT, the new head would be at (8,0). The collision check needs to ensure that this new position isn't occupied by any body cell except possibly the tail.

Wait, in the movement update rule, when checking for collisions, if the new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. So in this case, after moving LEFT, we need to check if (8,0) is part of the body cells.

Looking at the body cells: they are all along y=1 to 5 and x=9, so none of them have y=0 or x=8. Therefore, moving LEFT is safe.

So the first move could be LEFT.

But wait, after moving LEFT, we need to ensure that the body's movement doesn't cause any issues. Also, since the apple is at (7,5), which is two steps left from (9,5). So perhaps moving towards the left would help us reach the apple.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first to extend the body in a direction that can create space?

But let's think about the path. The head needs to move to (7,5) from (9,0), which is two steps left and five steps up. So we need to find a way to navigate around the current body.

If we start by moving LEFT, the new head would be at (8,0). Then, in the next step, we can consider moving UP towards the apple.

But let's plan the moves:

1. Move LEFT: from (9,0) to (8,0).
2. Next move could be UP, but we need to see if that's possible without collision.

After moving LEFT, the body would update by inserting the old head (9,0) at the front of the BODY list, which is currently [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)]. So the new BODY becomes [(9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)] because we didn't eat an apple yet.

Wait no: since after moving LEFT, we aren't eating the apple, so we would remove the tail. The initial body is length 5; moving without eating would keep it at length 5. So the new body would be [(8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)]? Wait no—wait, after the move, the head becomes (8,0). Then, the body is updated by inserting the old head (before move) at the front of the BODY list. So before moving, the BODY is [(9,1), (9,2), ..., (9,5)], which are 5 cells.

After moving LEFT:

- New head: (8,0)
- Insert old head (9,0) at front → new BODY becomes [(9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)]?
But wait, the length was 5; after moving without eating apple, we remove the tail. So initial body is 5 cells, adding the old head makes it 6, then removing the tail brings it back to 5? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, step 3 of movement update:

a. Insert old head at front → new BODY becomes [old_head] + current_body.
b. If new_head is apple, don't remove tail; else, remove last element (tail).

So in the first move, moving LEFT and not eating apple: body becomes [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ].

Wait no:

- Before move:
  - HEAD is at (9,0)
  - BODY is [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)]
- After moving LEFT:
  - New head is (8,0)
  - Insert old_head (9,0) into BODY → new_BODY = [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]
  - Since not eating apple, remove tail → new_BODY becomes [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

So the new S is [ (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ].

Wait no: the HEAD is updated to (8,0), and the BODY list after step 3a and 3b would be:

After inserting old head: [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]

Then since new_head is not apple, remove last element → [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

So the body now extends from (9,0) up to (9,4).

Wait, but that leaves the old tail at (9,5). So after moving LEFT, the body is [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ], which are five cells.

So in this case, after moving LEFT, the snake's body starts at (8,0) and then goes to (9,0), then up along x=9 from y=0 to 4. So that leaves (9,5) as an empty cell now.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Now, for the next move: after moving LEFT, we are at (8,0). We need to get towards (7,5), which is two more steps left and five up. But let's think about how to navigate around the body.

Another approach could be to move DOWN first. From (9,0), moving DOWN would take us to (9,1), but that's already occupied by the next body cell. So collision occurs; can't do that. Similarly, moving UP from (9,0) is not allowed as it's opposite direction.

So initial options are LEFT or RIGHT, but RIGHT is out of bounds, so only LEFT is possible first move.

After moving LEFT to (8,0), the next move could be UP towards (8,1). But wait, in the new body list after first move, does (9,0) become part of the body? Yes. So when we're at (8,0), our body starts with (9,0), then (9,1), etc.

So moving UP from (8,0) would take us to (8,1). Is that safe?

The collision check is whether new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell. So after first move:

BODY is [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

So (8,1) is not part of the body. Therefore, moving UP is safe.

But wait, how does the movement work? After moving LEFT to (8,0), we can then move UP from there.

Wait, but in terms of direction changes: after the first move was LEFT, our current direction becomes LEFT. So for the next move, we can't reverse, which would be RIGHT. But since we're at (8,0), and want to go up, that's allowed.

So let's outline possible moves:

1. Move LEFT → (8,0)
2. Then move UP multiple times to reach y=5
3. Then perhaps move LEFT again to reach x=7

But need to ensure that as we move up, we don't collide with the body.

Alternatively, maybe moving in a different direction after the first move.

Wait, let's try to map out the path:

- Start at (9,0)
- Move LEFT → (8,0)
- Then move UP 5 times: from (8,0) to (8,1), then to (8,2), ..., up to (8,5). But wait, y can go up to 9, so 5 steps is okay.
- Once at (8,5), we need to move LEFT again to reach x=7.

But let's check if this path would cause any collisions.

After first move: body is [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

So from (8,0), moving UP:

- After second move (UP): new head at (8,1). Body updates by inserting old_head (8,0), so body becomes [ (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ], then remove tail → [ (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3) ]

Wait no: initial body after first move is [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

After moving UP from (8,0):

- new head is (8,1)
- insert old_head (8,0) → new_body = [ (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]
- since not eating apple, remove tail: [ (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3) ]

So body is now five cells starting at (8,0).

Then, next move UP to (8,2):

- new head (8,2)
- insert old_head (8,1)
- body becomes [ (8,1), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3) ]
- remove tail: [ (8,1), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2) ]

Continuing this way, each time we move UP, the body shifts.

Eventually, when we reach y=5:

After moving UP five times from (8,0):

Positions would be (8,0) → (8,1) → (8,2) → ... → (8,5). Each step involves checking if new_head is in body except possibly the tail.

But wait, after each move, the body changes. Let's see:

After first move: head at (8,0), body [ (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

Second move: UP to (8,1), body becomes [ (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3) ]

Third move: UP to (8,2), body becomes [ (8,1), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2) ]

Fourth move: UP to (8,3), body becomes [ (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1) ]

Fifth move: UP to (8,4), body becomes [ (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), (9,0) ]

Sixth move: UP to (8,5), body becomes [ (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) ]

At this point, the body is along x=8 from y=4 down to 0.

So when we reach (8,5), can we then move LEFT to (7,5)? Let's check collision.

After moving UP to (8,5):

- new head is (8,5)
- insert old_head (8,4) → body becomes [ (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), (9,0) ]
- since not eating apple, remove tail: [ (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) ]

So the body is now from (8,4) down to (8,0). Now, moving LEFT from (8,5):

new_head would be (7,5)

Check if (7,5) is in the current body. Current body after sixth move: [ (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) ]

No overlap except perhaps the tail? Wait, no—the tail is at (8,0). So moving LEFT from (8,5) to (7,5) would be safe.

So this seems feasible. The path would be:

1. LEFT → (8,0)
2. UP × 5 → (8,5)
3. LEFT → (7,5)

But let's count the moves:

First move: LEFT

Then five UPs, then one LEFT. So total of seven moves.

But wait, after moving from (9,0) to (8,0), that's first move.

Second move: UP → (8,1)
Third: UP → (8,2)
Fourth: UP → (8,3)
Fifth: UP → (8,4)
Sixth: UP → (8,5)
Seventh: LEFT → (7,5)

So seven moves in total.

But wait, is this the most efficient path? Because the Manhattan distance is 7, which suggests that we should be able to do it in seven steps. So yes, this path works.

Another thing to consider is whether moving DOWN after some point could help, but I think the above approach is straightforward.

So the initial moves would be:

1. LEFT
2. UP (five times)
3. LEFT

Thus, the sequence of directions would be LEFT, then five times UP, then LEFT.

But wait, each move must follow from the current direction without reversing. So after moving LEFT, the next direction can't be RIGHT until we've made at least one more move in a different direction. Wait no—each time you change direction, it's allowed except for immediate reversals.

Wait, the movement rules only restrict reversing the direction on the first move if the current direction is not NONE. So after moving LEFT once, the next move can be any direction except RIGHT, which would reverse the previous move? Or does it allow changing to any direction unless you're immediately reversing?

I think that in this problem, each move's direction must not be the opposite of the previous one. So for example, if you moved LEFT, you cannot move RIGHT immediately next.

So after first move LEFT, second move can be UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT, but not RIGHT.

In our path, after moving LEFT, we then move UP five times, which is allowed because UP is neither LEFT nor the opposite direction (which would be RIGHT).

Then, from UP, when you want to move LEFT again, it's allowed because LEFT is not the opposite of UP.

So this should be okay.

Thus, the sequence would involve:

- First move: LEFT
- Next five moves: UP
- Last move: LEFT

But wait, after moving UP five times, we're at (8,5), then moving LEFT to (7,5).

Yes.

Therefore, the initial direction is LEFT, and following that with UPs and another LEFT should work without violating any movement rules.

So in terms of code or instructions, it would be:

MOVE LEFT

MOVE UP
MOVE UP
MOVE UP
MOVE UP
MOVE UP

MOVE LEFT

Thus, total moves: 7.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from the starting position (9,0) to the target position (7,5) on a grid. The movement rules dictate that the snake cannot reverse direction immediately and must avoid colliding with its own body.

### Approach
The approach involves making strategic moves to reach the target while adhering to the movement constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initial Move**: Start by moving LEFT from (9,0) to (8,0). This sets the initial direction and avoids collision as the next cell is empty.
2. **Vertical Movement**: Next, move UP five times from (8,0) to (8,5). Each upward move shifts the body of the snake upwards without causing any collisions since the target path is clear.
3. **Final Move**: After reaching (8,5), move LEFT to (7,5). This final move completes the path without reversing direction immediately.

This approach ensures that each move follows the rules and efficiently navigates the snake to the target position in seven steps, matching the Manhattan distance required.

### Solution Code
```python
# The sequence of moves is as follows:
# 1. Move LEFT from (9,0) to (8,0)
# 2. Move UP five times from (8,0) to (8,5)
# 3. Move LEFT from (8,5) to (7,5)

# This sequence ensures no immediate reversal and avoids collisions.
```

### Explanation
- **Move LEFT**: Starts at (9,0) and moves to (8,0), setting the initial direction without collision.
- **Move UP**: Each of the five UP moves shifts the snake upwards from (8,0) to (8,5). This vertical movement keeps the snake's body aligned without any immediate reversal or collision.
- **Final LEFT Move**: From (8,5) to (7,5), completing the journey to the target.

This method efficiently navigates the snake using a logical sequence of moves that adheres to the constraints and ensures safe traversal.
