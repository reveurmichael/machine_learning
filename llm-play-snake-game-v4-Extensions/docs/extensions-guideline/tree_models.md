# Tree-Based Models for Snake Game AI

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing tree-based machine learning models in the Snake Game AI project's supervised learning extensions.

## ðŸŒ³ **Overview**

Tree-based models represent a crucial category of machine learning algorithms that excel at tabular data prediction tasks. In the Snake Game AI context, these models learn decision-making patterns from heuristic-generated datasets to predict optimal moves.

### **Supported Tree-Based Models**

#### **1. Random Forest (scikit-learn)**
- **Type**: Ensemble of decision trees
- **Strengths**: Robust to overfitting, handles mixed data types well
- **Use Case**: Baseline model for tabular snake game data
- **Implementation**: `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`

#### **2. XGBoost**
- **Type**: Gradient boosting framework
- **Strengths**: High performance, feature importance, handles missing values
- **Use Case**: High-accuracy snake move prediction
- **Implementation**: `xgboost.XGBClassifier`

#### **3. LightGBM**
- **Type**: Gradient boosting with leaf-wise tree growth
- **Strengths**: Fast training, memory efficient, excellent for large datasets
- **Use Case**: Large-scale dataset training from multiple heuristics
- **Implementation**: `lightgbm.LGBMClassifier`

#### **4. CatBoost**
- **Type**: Gradient boosting with categorical feature handling
- **Strengths**: Built-in categorical encoding, robust to hyperparameters
- **Use Case**: Snake game data with categorical features (directions, game states)
- **Implementation**: `catboost.CatBoostClassifier`


**Tree-based models provide excellent performance for Snake Game AI with their ability to handle tabular data effectively, built-in feature importance, and robust training characteristics. They serve as strong baselines and often competitive alternatives to neural network approaches.**
