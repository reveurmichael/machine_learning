Okay, I'm trying to solve this Snake problem. Let's break down what's given.

The snake's head is at (3,3), and it needs to reach the apple at (9,4). The current direction is RIGHT. The body cells are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. So, the snake's body is behind the head.

First, I'll visualize the grid. The head is at (3,3). Since the direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction. Wait, no—the direction is RIGHT, so the previous move was probably RIGHT or something else? Actually, the movement rules say the snake cannot reverse direction. So if it's currently moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.

Wait, correction: The current direction is RIGHT, which means the last move was RIGHT. So the next move can't be LEFT because that would be reversing. Wait no—no, the rule says you can't reverse direction. So if the snake is moving RIGHT, it can't switch to LEFT next; similarly, if moving UP, can't go DOWN next.

So in this case, since current direction is RIGHT, the first move can't be LEFT because that would reverse. But looking at the movement rules again: "Cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If direction is NONE, any move allowed." So initial direction is RIGHT; first move can't be LEFT.

Wait no—wait, current direction is RIGHT. The next move can't be opposite of that. So the next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse. So from RIGHT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT, but not LEFT on the first step.

But wait, the constraints say: "Must not reverse direction on the first move." Oh right! So the first move cannot be the opposite of current direction. Current is RIGHT; so first move can't be LEFT.

So starting at (3,3), head is moving RIGHT now, but the next move can't be LEFT. Wait no—current direction is RIGHT, which was set by a previous move. The snake's body is behind it, so after each move, the head moves, and the tail may or may not shrink depending on whether an apple is eaten.

So first, I need to plan a path from (3,3) to (9,4), ensuring that the snake doesn't collide with its body and stays within grid bounds. Also, the path must satisfy the movement constraints.

Let me note the required number of moves based on the Manhattan distance. From (3,3) to (9,4): x increases by 6 (so right moves minus left moves = 6), y increases by 1 (up moves minus down moves =1). So overall, more rights than lefts and up moves than downs.

So in total, we need a net of 6 RIGHTs and 1 UP. The path must meet this condition.

Now, let's look at the current body: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. These are all behind the head at (3,3). So when moving forward, we have to make sure that the new head position doesn't collide with any of these body cells.

The apple is at (9,4). Let's see: the head needs to move right multiple times but also up once. However, the snake is currently facing RIGHT, so it can continue moving right but must avoid hitting its own body as it moves.

Wait, if the snake continues moving right, the next position would be (4,3), which is already part of the body. So that's a collision. Therefore, the first move can't be RIGHT because (4,3) is occupied.

So possible initial moves are UP or DOWN, but not LEFT since it's reverse direction.

Let me consider moving UP first.

If head moves up to (3,4). Check if this position is safe: body cells don't include (3,4), so it's okay. Then, the next move can be RIGHT, as long as it doesn't hit any body parts.

Wait, but after moving up, direction would change from RIGHT to UP for that move. Then, in the next step, the snake could go right again if possible.

But I need to plan a path that avoids collision and meets the movement constraints.

Alternatively, maybe move DOWN first: (3,2). But then, is (3,2) safe? The body cells include (3,2), so moving down would cause collision. So that's not allowed.

So initial moves can only be UP or RIGHT, but RIGHT leads to collision because the next cell is already part of the body. Wait no—when you move, the head moves, and then the body follows, but before movement, we check if the new head position is safe.

Wait, when moving, the new head must not collide with any existing body cells (excluding itself). So in the first step, moving UP to (3,4) is okay because that cell isn't part of the current body. Then, after moving, the snake's body will shift: the head becomes (3,4), and the tail remains unless an apple is eaten.

But since we haven't eaten the apple yet, each move shifts the body by one segment.

Wait, but for this problem, I'm just planning the moves until the head reaches the apple. So let's think step by step.

Option 1: Move UP first to (3,4). Then from there, plan a path to (9,4).

From (3,4), the direction is now UP because that was the move made. The next move can't be DOWN because that would reverse direction.

So from (3,4), possible moves are RIGHT or UP again.

If we move UP to (3,5): safe? Let's check body after first move:

After moving up from (3,3) to (3,4), the body becomes [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]—no, wait: when you move, the head moves, and each segment follows. The tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, no: in the initial state, the body cells are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. So when moving up to (3,4), the new head is at (3,4). The previous head was at (3,3); now that becomes part of the body. But wait: no—the body cells are given as [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)], which are all behind the current head.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The head is at (3,3). The body cells list doesn't include (3,3) because it's the head. So when moving to a new position, the new head becomes (new_x, new_y), and the previous positions become part of the body except for the tail if no apple is eaten.

Wait, but in this problem, we are given the current state before any moves. The body cells don't include the head's position because it's excluded.

So when moving, each step adds a new head position, which then becomes part of the body (except for the first move). Wait, perhaps I should model how the snake's body changes with each move.

But maybe that's getting too detailed. Let me think about possible paths.

Alternative approach: Since the apple is at (9,4), which is 6 steps to the right and 1 step up from the current head.

So the net movement needs to be +6 in x and +1 in y.

If I can move right as much as possible without hitting body parts, that would be efficient. But initial movement to the right leads to collision because (4,3) is part of the body.

Wait, but perhaps after moving UP once, then we can start moving RIGHT.

So let's try:

Move 1: UP to (3,4). Now, head is at (3,4), direction is UP.

Move 2: Can't go DOWN because that would reverse. So possible moves are UP or RIGHT.

If I move UP again to (3,5): safe? Let me check the body after first move. The body after first move will be [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. So moving up to (3,5) is okay because it's not in the body.

But then, from there, I need to move right 6 times. But wait, each time I move right, I have to check if the new position is safe.

Alternatively, maybe after moving UP once, change direction and start moving RIGHT.

Wait, but when you make a move, the direction changes accordingly. So moving UP first would set the direction to UP for that step, then the next move can't be DOWN.

So perhaps:

1. Move UP to (3,4). Direction is now UP.
2. Next move: can go RIGHT or UP again.

If I move RIGHT from (3,4) to (4,4): but (4,4) is part of the body after first step. So that's a collision.

Wait no—after moving UP to (3,4), the previous head at (3,3) becomes part of the body. The new body cells would be [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. Wait no—the initial body is given as [(4,4), (4,3), etc.] plus the head at (3,3). So when moving to (3,4), the new body includes all previous cells except the tail? Or does it include everything?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating. Let's think of each move step by step.

Initial state:

Head: (3,3)
Body: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]
Direction: RIGHT

First move options: can't go LEFT because it's reverse. So UP or DOWN or RIGHT.

But moving RIGHT to (4,3) is part of the body—collision. So first move can be UP or DOWN.

Wait, initial direction is RIGHT; so after moving, the new direction is whatever we choose next. Wait no—the direction changes based on the move made.

So if you're currently facing RIGHT and make a move, say, UP, then your new direction becomes UP for the next step.

But movement rules say that you can't reverse direction. So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT; but in this case, since it's the first move, and current direction is RIGHT, you can choose any other direction except LEFT.

Wait no—the constraint says "Must not reverse direction on the first move." So if current direction is RIGHT, the first move can't be LEFT. Because that would reverse.

So for the first move, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT? Wait, but moving in the same direction as before is allowed.

But wait, the initial direction is RIGHT. If I choose to continue moving RIGHT, then the next position is (4,3), which is part of the body—so collision occurs. So that's not allowed.

So first move must be UP or DOWN.

As discussed earlier:

Option 1: Move UP to (3,4). Now, direction is UP.

Next, from (3,4), can't go DOWN because that would reverse.

Possible moves: UP again or RIGHT.

If I go UP again to (3,5): body after first move includes the previous head at (3,3) as part of the body? Or does the body shift by one each time?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the snake's body after each move.

Let me try:

Initial state: Head is (3,3). Body cells are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. So the snake's path is from (2,3) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,2) → (4,3) → (4,4). Then head is at (3,3).

Wait, that seems a bit odd because the head is at (3,3), but the body starts from (4,4). Hmm.

But perhaps the snake's tail is at (2,3), then moves up to (2,2), etc. So when moving, each segment follows the previous.

In any case, when you move the head, the body cells shift: the new head becomes the first element of the body, and the last cell is removed unless an apple is eaten.

But in this problem, we are only planning moves up to eating the apple, so each move after that will add a new head position but not grow until the apple is eaten.

Wait, no—each move shifts the snake's body. Only when the apple is eaten does the tail not shrink.

So during the path towards the apple, each step adds the new head and removes the last segment (tail), unless an apple is eaten in that step.

But since we're planning moves until eating the apple, the body will grow only after eating it.

Wait no—when you eat the apple, you add a segment. So during movement steps before eating, the tail shrinks each time, but when you eat the apple, the tail doesn't shrink because the body grows by one.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating; let's get back to planning the moves.

So first move: UP to (3,4). Now, body cells after this move would be [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. Because we add the new head and remove the tail (since no apple is eaten yet).

Wait, original body was [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)], which includes 6 cells. When moving UP to (3,4), the new head is added at front, making the body now [(3,4)] + original body except last cell? Or perhaps it's the head followed by all previous body cells except the last.

Wait, I think each time you move, the head moves, and the tail is removed unless you eat an apple. So initial body is 6 cells; after moving UP, the new body would be [new_head] + original_body[0:-1], which would still have 6 cells.

But in any case, for collision detection, we only need to check if the new head position is not present in the current body (excluding itself).

So from (3,4), possible moves: UP or RIGHT.

If I move UP again to (3,5):

Body after first move is [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. So moving to (3,5) is safe because it's not in the body. Then direction becomes UP.

From (3,5), can't go DOWN next step as that would reverse.

Then move UP again to (3,6): still safe.

But this way, I'm going up 3 steps and then need to move right 6 times. But after moving up, each time I move right, I have to check if the new position is in the body.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path would be:

1. Move UP once to (3,4). Body: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) ]

Now, head is at (3,4).

Next move: can't go DOWN, so choose RIGHT.

Move RIGHT to (4,4). But wait, the body after first move includes (4,4) as the second cell. So moving to (4,4) would cause collision because it's part of the body.

So that's not allowed. So from (3,4), moving RIGHT is blocked because (4,4) is in the body.

Alternatively, perhaps move UP again to (3,5):

Body after first move: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)].

Moving to (3,5) is safe.

Then from (3,5), can't go DOWN. So next moves could be UP or RIGHT.

But moving UP again: (3,6) is okay.

Alternatively, after two UP moves:

1. Move UP to (3,4)
2. Move UP to (3,5)

Body becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]

Now, from (3,5), can I move RIGHT? Let's check: moving right to (4,5). Is that in the body?

The body is [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]. So (4,5) isn't in the body. So safe.

So move 3: RIGHT to (4,5). Direction now RIGHT.

Now, from (4,5), possible moves next step can be any except DOWN because we came from UP, but wait—no, movement direction is based on the current direction. Wait, no—the direction after moving RIGHT is now RIGHT for the next move.

Wait, let me clarify:

Each time you make a move, your direction changes to that new direction.

So in step 1: moved UP → direction is UP.
Step 2: moved UP again → direction is UP.
Step 3: moved RIGHT → direction is RIGHT.

In step 4: can't move LEFT because it would reverse from RIGHT.

Wait no—constraints are you can't reverse direction. So if your current direction is RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT.

So from (4,5), direction is RIGHT. So next moves must be FORWARD or something else that doesn't involve reversing.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rules.

The movement rule says: "You cannot reverse direction." So when you are moving in a certain direction, you can't make a move that goes back along the same line. For example, if facing RIGHT, can't go LEFT next; but can go UP or DOWN.

So from (4,5), having moved to the right, direction is RIGHT. Next move cannot be LEFT.

Wait no—the rule says you can't reverse direction. So if moving forward, you can't turn around immediately.

So in terms of movement:

- If current direction is RIGHT: next move can't be LEFT.
- Similarly for other directions.

But when changing direction, as long as it's not a direct reversal, it's allowed.

Wait, perhaps the rule is that you can't make a 180-degree turn. So from any direction, you can't immediately reverse.

So if moving RIGHT, next move can be UP or DOWN, but not LEFT.

Similarly, if moving UP, next can be LEFT or RIGHT, but not DOWN.

This makes movement planning more complex.

So back to step 3: at (4,5), direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

Options: move UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

But continuing right might lead into the body again.

Wait, from (4,5), moving RIGHT would go to (5,5). Is that in the body?

The body after step 3 is [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]. So (5,5) isn't part of the body. So safe.

But moving right further would require checking each time.

Alternatively, maybe from (4,5), it's better to move UP or DOWN to avoid potential collisions when moving right multiple times.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe a different approach: plan a path that moves UP enough so that moving RIGHT won't hit any body cells.

Let me consider:

After step 1: Move UP → (3,4). Direction UP.
Step 2: Move UP → (3,5). Direction UP.
Step 3: Move RIGHT → (4,5). Direction RIGHT.
Now, from here, each move can be to the right until reaching x=9.

But wait, the apple is at (9,4), which is 6 steps to the right and same y as current position after moving up once. Wait no—the apple is at (9,4), but in my path, I'm at (4,5). So from there, I need to move down 1 step to get back to y=4.

Wait, that might be a better idea.

So:

Step 1: Move UP → (3,4)
Step 2: Move UP → (3,5)
Step 3: Move RIGHT → (4,5)
Step 4: Move DOWN → (4,4). But is this allowed?

From step 3, direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT. So moving DOWN from (4,5) to (4,4): possible.

But does that cause a collision? Let's check body after step 3:

Body after step 3: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]

So moving DOWN to (4,4) would be the same as the fourth cell in the body. That's a collision.

No good.

Alternative plan:

Step 1: UP → (3,4)
Step 2: RIGHT → can't because body at (4,4)
Wait no—step 2, from (3,4), can move RIGHT to (4,4)? But after step 1, the body includes (4,4) as part of it.

Yes, because after moving UP to (3,4), the body becomes [(3,4), (4,4), ...]. So moving RIGHT to (4,4) would be a collision. Thus, not allowed.

So that's a problem.

Alternative idea: move UP twice and then move RIGHT once.

Wait, but earlier attempts showed issues.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN initially:

Step 1: Move DOWN from (3,3) → (3,2). Is this possible?

Current direction is RIGHT. Moving DOWN would set new direction to DOWN. Not reversing.

But after step 1, the head is at (3,2), and body cells become [(3,2), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), ...? Wait no—the initial body was [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. So moving DOWN from (3,3) to (3,2)—is that in the body?

Yes! Because after moving, (3,2) is part of the original body cells. So collision occurs.

So can't move DOWN as first step because it leads to collision.

Thus, only possible first moves are UP or RIGHT. But moving RIGHT causes collision, so only option is UP.

So back to initial plan:

Step 1: Move UP → (3,4)
Body after step 1: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]

Now, from (3,4), can't move DOWN. So options are UP or RIGHT.

If I move UP again:

Step 2: Move UP → (3,5). Body becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]

From here, can't move DOWN next step because direction is UP, so next moves can be UP or RIGHT.

Step 3: Move RIGHT → (4,5). Body becomes [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]

Now, from (4,5), direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

If I try to move DOWN:

Step 4: Move DOWN → (4,4). But (4,4) is in the body [(4,5), (3,5), ... , (4,4)] as fourth element. So collision.

Not allowed.

Alternative step 4: Continue RIGHT to (5,5). Safe?

Body after step 3: no (5,5) yet, so safe. Move to (5,5).

Step 4: Move RIGHT → (5,5)
Body becomes [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]

From here, direction is RIGHT.

Continue moving right:

Step 5: Move to (6,5)
...
Continuing until x=9, but need to reach y=4 as well. So at some point, have to move DOWN from y=5 to y=4 without colliding with body.

But this seems tricky because after each RIGHT move, the body is extending to the right, so when trying to move down, might hit the part that's now part of the body.

Alternatively, perhaps make a U-turn by moving UP and then RIGHT?

Wait, but can't reverse direction immediately. So from direction RIGHT, next moves cannot be LEFT.

This is getting too complex; maybe another approach: plan a path that moves in such a way to avoid body collisions while reaching the target.

Another idea: Since the apple is at (9,4), which is same y as original position after moving UP once, but higher x. Maybe find a path that allows moving right without having to go down into the body.

Alternatively, move further up and then spiral around?

Wait, maybe it's better to simulate each step carefully:

After step 1: (3,4), direction UP.
Body: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]

Step 2: move UP → (3,5). Direction UP.
Body: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]

Step 3: move RIGHT → (4,5). Direction RIGHT.
Body: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]

Now at (4,5), direction RIGHT. Next steps can't be LEFT.

Attempt to move right to (5,5):

Step 4: (5,5). Body: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]

From here, direction is RIGHT. Next step can't be LEFT.

Continue moving right:

Step 5: (6,5)
Body: [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ]

Step 6: (7,5)
Body: [ ... ]

Step 7: (8,5)
Body: [ ... ]

Step 8: (9,5). Now at x=9, but need to get to y=4.

So from (9,5), direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

But we're at the target x=9, so now need to move DOWN from (9,5) → (9,4).

Check if moving DOWN causes collision:

After step 8: body is [ (9,5), (8,5), ..., (3,4) ]

Wait no—the body after each right move would be the previous head followed by all previous body except last. So at step 8, the body would include up to (3,4). So moving DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4):

Is (9,4) in the current body? Let's see:

Current body after step 8: [ (9,5), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]

So (9,4) is not in this list. So safe.

Thus, step 9: move DOWN to (9,4). Reached target! But wait, the movement rules—can I move DOWN after moving RIGHT? Yes, as it's a change of direction but not a reversal.

Wait no—the current direction is RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT. DOWN is allowed because it's changing direction without reversing.

So step 9: Move DOWN → (9,4). Success!

Thus, the path would be:

1. UP
2. UP
3. RIGHT
4. RIGHT
5. RIGHT
6. RIGHT
7. RIGHT
8. RIGHT
9. DOWN

But let's count the steps correctly.

Wait, after step 3: at (4,5). Then moving right 5 more times:

Steps 4-8: moving from x=4 to x=9 on y=5.

Then step 9: move down to y=4.

So total steps: 9 moves.

But let's check each step for collision:

After step 1: (3,4) safe.
Step 2: (3,5) safe.
Step 3: (4,5) safe.
Steps 4-8: moving right each time—safe because the new position isn't in body.
Step 9: move down to (9,4)—safe.

Thus, this path works.

Alternatively, is there a shorter path?

Another approach:

After step 1: UP → (3,4)

From here, can we make a series of moves that go right and up alternately without collision? Not sure.

But the earlier plan seems to work with 9 steps.

So, I think this is the solution.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting position (3, 3) to the target position (9, 4) on a grid while avoiding collisions with our own body. The movement rules state that we cannot reverse direction immediately after moving in another direction.

### Approach
The approach involves strategically moving up and then right to avoid colliding with the snake's body, which grows as we move. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Move Up**: From (3, 3) to (3, 4). This gets us closer to the target in terms of the y-coordinate.
2. **Move Up Again**: From (3, 4) to (3, 5). This further increases our y-coordinate, providing more space to move right without collision.
3. **Move Right**: From (3, 5) to (4, 5), then continue moving right all the way to (9, 5).
4. **Move Down**: Finally, from (9, 5) down to (9, 4), reaching the target.

Each move is checked for collisions with the snake's body, ensuring we do not reverse direction immediately and maintain a safe path.

### Solution Code
```python
def find_path(start, end):
    # Directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
    directions = ['UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT']
    
    current_pos = start
    path = []
    body = []  # This will track the snake's body
    
    # Initialize with starting position
    body.append(current_pos)
    
    while current_pos != end:
        next_pos = None
        
        # Try moving UP
        candidate = (current_pos[0], current_pos[1] + 1)
        if not any(c == candidate for c in body):
            next_pos = 'UP'
        
        # If UP is blocked, try DOWN
        if next_pos is None:
            candidate = (current_pos[0], current_pos[1] - 1)
            if not any(c == candidate for c in body) and candidate[1] >= 0:
                next_pos = 'DOWN'
        
        # If still blocked, try RIGHT
        if next_pos is None:
            candidate = (current_pos[0] + 1, current_pos[1])
            if not any(c == candidate for c in body):
                next_pos = 'RIGHT'
        
        # Last resort: LEFT, but need to check it's not reversing direction
        if next_pos is None:
            candidate = (current_pos[0] - 1, current_pos[1])
            # Check if moving LEFT would reverse the last movement
            if len(body) > 1 and body[-2][0] == body[-1][0]:

### Explanation
The solution involves a series of moves that first navigate upwards to create space and then move right towards the target. Each movement is checked against the snake's body to ensure no collisions, adhering to the rule of not reversing direction immediately. This approach efficiently navigates from (3, 3) to (9, 4) in 9 steps without any self-collisions.

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the head now at (3, 3) to eat the apple at (9, 4).

RULES:
- Text at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 is less important than the text at the end.
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
