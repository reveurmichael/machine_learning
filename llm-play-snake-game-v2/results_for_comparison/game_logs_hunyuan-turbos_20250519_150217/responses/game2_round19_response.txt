  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move left to decrease the x-coordinate from 1 to 0 and up to increase the y-coordinate from 7 to 8. The first move is LEFT to avoid reversing direction, followed by UP to approach the apple. Subsequent moves continue to prioritize reaching the apple while avoiding collisions."
