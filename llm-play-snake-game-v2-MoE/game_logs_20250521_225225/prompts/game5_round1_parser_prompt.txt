You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from its current position at (5,5) to the apple at (2,6). The snake's head is at (5,5), and it can't reverse direction on the first move. Right now, the snake only has its head because the body list is empty. That means the snake is just a single segment right now.

First, I need to think about the movement rules. The snake can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. It can't reverse direction immediately, so if it moves LEFT first, next time it can't move RIGHT. But since there's no body yet, moving isn't blocked by the body unless the head goes outside the grid or collides with the body after moving.

The goal is to reach (2,6). Let me calculate how many steps I need in each direction. From (5,5) to (2,6), the x-coordinate decreases by 3, so I need more LEFT moves than RIGHT by 3. The y-coordinate increases by 1, so I need one more UP move than DOWN.

Since there's no body yet except the head, moving isn't blocked by that until the snake grows after eating the apple. So initially, the only constraints are grid boundaries and not reversing direction on the first move.

I should plan a path where each move is safe. Let me consider starting with LEFT because I need to decrease x by 3. If I move LEFT three times:

1. Move LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5)
2. Then again LEFT to (3,5)
3. Then another LEFT to (2,5)

Wait, that's only moving in x from 5 to 2 with three LEFT moves. But the y needs to increase by 1 to reach 6. So maybe after moving LEFT three times, I should move UP once.

But wait, can I do that? Let me check:

First move: LEFT → (4,5). Now direction was LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT. Next move could be another LEFT or something else except RIGHT.

Second move: LEFT → (3,5).

Third move: Can't reverse from LEFT to RIGHT, but can move LEFT again? No, because if I'm at (3,5) and moving LEFT would take me to (2,5), which is valid. So third move: LEFT → (2,5).

Now, since direction was LEFT for the first three moves, next move cannot be RIGHT unless it's allowed now.

But from (2,5), I need to go up to (2,6). Let's see:

Fourth move: Can't reverse direction if previous was LEFT. So can I move UP? Yes, because after three LEFTs, the next direction is free except for the first move constraint.

So fourth move: UP → (2,6).

This seems like a possible path: [LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP]. Let me check grid boundaries:

Each step goes from 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 in x. Then up to 6 in y. All positions are within the 10x10 grid.

Wait, but after moving LEFT three times and then UP once, does that reach (2,6)? Yes.

But wait, when moving RIGHT is not allowed after three LEFTs? No, because only consecutive reversals are forbidden. The snake can move in other directions as long as it's not reversing from the previous direction.

Wait, but in this case, all moves except the last were LEFT, so no reversal until the fourth move where we switch to UP, which is fine.

So that seems safe. Also, since there's no body yet, none of these moves will cause collision with the body (since body is empty).

But let me make sure:

After each move, the snake's head would be at:

1. (4,5) - valid
2. (3,5)
3. (2,5)
4. (2,6)

All within grid bounds.

No collision with body since it's only the head moving into new cells that are empty.

Therefore, this path seems safe and direct. But wait, according to the problem statement, after eating the apple, there should be at least one legal move afterward. In this case, when we reach (2,6), does the snake still have a way to move?

After eating the apple, the body grows by 1 segment. So from the head being at (2,6), the next moves would require moving without reversing immediately.

From (2,6), possible directions could be RIGHT or something else as long as it's not LEFT if previous was UP. Wait, no: last move before eating was UP, so next can't be DOWN? Or is it that after the apple is eaten, direction is allowed to change except for the initial reversal.

Wait, the rules say the snake cannot reverse direction on the first move regardless of whether the apple has been eaten. So if I reach (2,6) in one move and then have another move, can't immediately go back.

But actually, when you eat the apple, the body length increases by 1, so next moves might be blocked by the new body segments unless they are at least two cells away.

Wait, but since we were moving from (2,5) to (2,6), and after that the snake has grown to have a body segment at (2,6). So when planning the move after eating the apple, you can't step on any existing body segments except for your own head's next position.

So if I'm about to move from (2,6) again, say UP is not possible because it would go beyond grid. Maybe RIGHT or something else.

But in our initial plan, we reached the target in four moves: three LEFT and one UP. So after eating the apple, the snake's body is longer by one segment at (2,6), but as long as there are other empty cells to move into, it can do so without immediate reversal.

So perhaps this path is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe another path could be more efficient, but in this case, moving LEFT three times and then UP once seems straightforward and safe.

I think that should work. So the sequence would be:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. UP

Each move is valid, doesn't reverse direction unless necessary, and reaches the target without stepping on itself or going out of bounds.
</think>

To reach the target position (2,6) from (5,5), you can follow a path that involves moving three times to the left followed by one move up. This sequence ensures each move is valid according to the movement rules.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** Start at (5,5). The snake has only its head, so no body blocks your way.
2. **First Move:** Move LEFT to (4,5). Previous direction was none, so moving LEFT is allowed.
3. **Second Move:** Move LEFT again to (3,5). Last move was LEFT, but since you're not reversing, it's acceptable for the second consecutive LEFT.
4. **Third Move:** Move LEFT once more to reach (2,5). Now only two LEFTs in a row; next cannot be RIGHT yet.
5. **Fourth Move:** Switch direction and move UP from (2,5) to (2,6), which is your target.

**Result:**
After these four moves, you have reached the position (2,6) without violating any movement rules or stepping outside the grid boundaries. Additionally, upon reaching the apple, there are still valid moves available for future gameplay.

WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (2, 6).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
