<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (9,2) to eat the apple at (8,7). The current direction is DOWN, and the body cells are [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the snake's current position. The head is at (9,2). Since the direction is DOWN, that means the head was moving down from (9,3) to (9,2). Looking at the body cells: [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)], so each segment follows the previous one. So after the head is (9,3), then (9,4), and so on.

The apple is at (8,7). The goal is to move the snake's head towards this position without causing any collisions with the body or going out of bounds. Also, I have to make sure that after eating the apple, there's still a way for the snake to move next turn without dying.

Let me visualize the grid. The head is at (9,2), which is on the top row since y=2 and it goes from 0 at the bottom to 9 at the top. The apple is at (8,7), which is also towards the top but a bit to the left of the current head.

Since the head is at (9,2) and the direction is DOWN, if I move again in the same direction, it would go to (9,1). But that might not be the best path. Let's consider the possible directions without reversing immediately. Since the current direction is DOWN, I can't choose UP next.

Wait, no—wait, according to the rules, you cannot reverse direction on the first move if the direction is NONE, but since the current direction is DOWN, the next move cannot be UP. So from DOWN, the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

Looking at the coordinates, to get to (8,7) from (9,2), I need to decrease x by 1 and increase y by 5. That's a total of one left and five ups. But since each move can only change either x or y by 1, I have to plan the path carefully.

But wait, the snake has a body that might block certain paths. Let me see where the body is currently:

- (9,3) is behind the head.
- Then (9,4), (9,5), which are all in line with the head's current position.
- After that, it turns to (8,5) and then (7,5). So the snake is extending from (9,2) down to (9,3), etc., then turning left at some point.

So the body extends downward along x=9 up to y=5, then moves left to x=8, y=5, and continues left to x=7, y=5. So in terms of blocking, if I move the head towards (8,7), I need to make sure that my path doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

Since the apple is at (8,7), which is above and to the left of the current head. So from (9,2), moving left once would take me to (8,2). Then I need to move up five times to reach y=7.

But wait, let's check if that path is possible without collision. Let's see:

Current body cells are [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]. So the tail is at (7,5). If I move left to (8,2) first, then in the next step, when I move up, I have to check if any body cells are in the way.

Wait, after moving left once, the new head would be (8,2), and the body would update as follows:

- The old head (9,2) is added to the front of the body list. So the new body becomes [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)] because we remove the tail if not eating an apple.

Wait no—since moving left doesn't eat the apple, so after moving, the body would shift: the old head is added to the front, and the tail is removed. So initial body is [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]. After moving left once:

- New head is (8,2).
- Old head (9,2) is inserted at the front of the body list: [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5) ].
- Since we're not eating an apple, the tail (7,5) is removed. So new body becomes [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)].

So now the snake's head is at (8,2), and the body goes up to (8,5). So when moving from (8,2) upwards, I have to check for collisions with these body cells except possibly the tail if it's about to move.

Wait, but after each move, the body shifts. So in the next step, moving UP would take me to (8,3). Now, does that cell collide with any body segments?

After moving left once, the body is [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)]. So from (8,2) moving up to (8,3)—is (8,3) occupied by any body segment except perhaps the tail? The body has (9,2), which is not in that area. Wait, no—the current body after first move includes (9,2), but when I'm at (8,3), none of these body cells are at (8,3). So it's safe.

Then moving up again to (8,4)—same check: none of the body segments except possibly the tail. Wait, no—because after each move, the tail moves unless we eat an apple. But since I'm not eating an apple in this step, the tail would have moved.

Wait, let's simulate the first few steps:

1. Current state:
   - Head: (9,2)
   - Direction: DOWN
   - Body: [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]
   
2. Move LEFT to (8,2):
   - New head: (8,2)
   - Check collision: new_head is within bounds.
   - No collision with body except possibly the tail when it moves. After moving, since not eating apple, body becomes [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)].
   
3. Next move UP to (8,3):
   - Check collision: new_head is (8,3). Does this collide with any body except the tail when it's about to move? The body after first move is [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)]. So (8,3) is not in the body list except possibly if the tail moves. But since we are moving UP now, and the tail was at (8,5). After this move, when updating the body, the old head (8,2) would be added to front, making the new body [(8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)], then remove the tail (8,5). So during collision check for (8,3), none of the current body cells are at that position except perhaps if any segment is there. But in this case, no.

So moving up to (8,3) is safe.

Then again UP to (8,4): same logic, checking each time.

But wait, after each move, the body shifts. So let's think about how the body will change:

After first move:
- Head: (8,2)
- Body: [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)]

Move UP to (8,3):
- New head: (8,3)
- Check collision: safe.
- Insert old head (8,2) into body front: [(8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)]
- Remove tail since not eating apple: new body is [(8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)]

Now head is at (8,3).

Next move UP to (8,4):
- Check collision with current body except the tail. Current body after second move is [(8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)]. So (8,4) isn't in the body.

But wait, let me think: after moving to (8,3), when I move again UP to (8,4), the new head is (8,4). The body now becomes [(8,3), ... ] but no—wait, each time we add the old head to the front and remove the tail.

So from the second step:

After moving to (8,3):
- Body: [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]
Next move UP:
- New head: (8,4)
- Insert (8,3) into front of body.
- Remove tail (9,5) because we're not eating an apple.
So new body becomes [ (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

Wait, no—after moving to (8,3), the body is:

Inserting old head (8,2) at front: [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]? No, wait. Wait I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, after the first move, when we moved LEFT to (8,2):

- Old body was [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]
- Insert old head (9,2) at front: [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5) ]
- Since we're not eating an apple, remove the tail (7,5). So new body is [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]

Then moving UP to (8,3):

- Old head is now (8,2), which is added to front of current body.
- Current body before move: [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]
- Inserting (8,2) at front: [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]
- Remove tail (8,5): new body is [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]

So after moving UP to (8,3), the body becomes [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ].

Now, for the next move up to (8,4):

- New head is (8,4)
- Check collision: does (8,4) collide with any body except possibly the tail when it moves.
- Current body before this move is [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]
- None of these are at (8,4), so safe.

Insert old head (8,3) into front: [ (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]

Remove tail (9,5): new body is [ (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

So no collision again.

Continuing this way, moving up each time. Let's see:

After 5 UP moves from (8,2):

(8,2) → (8,3) → (8,4) → (8,5) → (8,6) → (8,7)

So that would take five UP moves after the initial LEFT move.

But wait, when moving up to (8,5), what's the body like?

After third move:

Head: (8,4)
Body: [ (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

Move UP to (8,5):

- New head is (8,5)
- Check collision with body except tail.

Current body before move: [ (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]
None at (8,5). Safe.

Insert old head (8,4) into front: [ (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

Remove tail (9,4): new body is [ (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3) ]

Now, moving to (8,5).

Next move UP: (8,6)

Check collision:

Body before this move: [ (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3) ]
No conflict.

Insert (8,5) at front, remove tail (9,3): new body is [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2) ]

And so on until reaching (8,7).

At this point, when the head reaches (8,7), we would eat the apple. So let's see what happens then.

When moving to (8,7):

- New head is (8,7)
- Check collision: since we're eating an apple, body doesn't shrink.
- Insert old head (8,6) into front of body list and don't remove tail.

So after eating the apple, the body becomes [ (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3) ]

Wait, but I think I need to make sure that after eating the apple, the next move doesn't get stuck because of the body.

But since we are at (8,7), which is the apple's position, and then after that, perhaps the snake can continue moving without issues.

However, another consideration is whether there's enough space around the apple for future moves. But since the problem only asks to eat the apple, maybe this path suffices.

So the sequence of moves would be:

1. LEFT
2. UP
3. UP
4. UP
5. UP
6. UP

That's a total of six moves: one left and five ups.

But wait, let's make sure that each move is allowed in terms of direction changes.

From DOWN, we can't immediately reverse to UP; but moving LEFT or RIGHT is allowed. So the first move must be either LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. But continuing DOWN from (9,2) would take us to (9,1), which is further away from the apple.

So moving LEFT is better as it brings us closer in x-coordinate towards the apple.

Therefore, the initial move is LEFT to (8,2). Then five UP moves.

But wait, let's count the exact steps:

Move 1: LEFT → (8,2)
Move 2: UP → (8,3)
Move 3: UP → (8,4)
Move 4: UP → (8,5)
Move 5: UP → (8,6)
Move 6: UP → (8,7)

So six moves in total. But I think the initial direction is DOWN, so after moving LEFT, the new direction becomes LEFT? Or does it remain as whatever we choose next.

Wait, no—each move sets the new direction. So from DOWN, the first move can be LEFT or RIGHT, but not UP (since that's reversing). Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

The initial direction is DOWN. The rules say you cannot reverse on the first move if current direction is NONE, but in this case, current direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP.

So when moving from DOWN, possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT, or continue DOWN (but continuing DOWN would go further down which is away from the apple).

Therefore, the initial move must be either LEFT or RIGHT. So from (9,2), the first move has to be LEFT or RIGHT because we can't reverse.

So let's say first move is LEFT to (8,2). Now direction becomes LEFT? Or does it change based on the move. Wait, no—the direction is set by the movement. So after moving LEFT once, the new direction is LEFT.

Wait no—direction changes with each move. So if I'm currently facing DOWN and then move LEFT, my new direction will be LEFT for subsequent moves.

But wait, that's not correct. The direction isn't necessarily tied to the previous move; it can change based on where you decide to move next.

So from (9,2) moving LEFT to (8,2), the direction becomes LEFT, but then I can choose any direction except the reverse of LEFT, which would be RIGHT? Or is there no restriction after the first move?

Wait, no—the only restriction is that on the first move, if you were facing a certain direction, you cannot immediately reverse. But once you make another move, you can change directions as needed.

So in this case:

1. Start at (9,2), direction DOWN.
   - Can't move UP next.
2. Move LEFT to (8,2). Now direction is LEFT.
3. From here, I can choose any direction except RIGHT? Or no—because the restriction only applies on the first move after being in a certain direction.

Wait, according to the problem statement: "You cannot reverse direction immediately if your current direction is NONE." But since we started with DOWN as the direction, and then moved LEFT, which changes the direction to LEFT. Now, from LEFT, can I choose any direction except RIGHT (the reverse of LEFT)?

I think that's a common snake game rule—you can't reverse direction into yourself.

So from direction LEFT, you can move UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT, but not RIGHT.

Therefore, after moving LEFT, the next moves must be in directions other than RIGHT.

But since we're trying to get to (8,7), which is straight up, that's okay.

So, after moving LEFT once, our direction is LEFT. Then, for the next move, can't go RIGHT. So from (8,2), facing LEFT, what options do we have?

Wait no—facing LEFT means you're looking towards decreasing x-coordinate. Wait, actually, direction in snake is typically the way the head is pointing. So if you move LEFT, your head is now at (8,2) and you are facing LEFT.

So from there, possible moves without reversing would be UP or DOWN (since RIGHT would be reverse of LEFT).

But we need to go UP, so that's fine.

Therefore:

1. Move LEFT to (8,2), direction is LEFT.
2. From here, move UP to (8,3).
3. Continue moving UP until reaching (8,7).

So the moves are possible without violating any rules.

Thus, the path is feasible.

Another consideration: when the head reaches (8,5), which was part of the body after the first few moves? Let's see:

After moving LEFT to (8,2), then moving UP to (8,3):

Body at that point is [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]

Wait, no—earlier we thought after the first move, body becomes [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ] when eating an apple? Wait, maybe I confused.

No, wait: After moving LEFT to (8,2), the body is [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ] but that's not correct because after first move, tail isn't at (8,5). Wait, let me clarify.

After initial move:

Start: head at (9,2), body segments behind are [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].

Wait no—the snake's body is a sequence of positions. When the snake moves, each segment follows the one in front.

So initially:

Snake is at (9,2) with segments behind: [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].

Wait that can't be right because direction was DOWN. So when facing DOWN, moving further down would go from (9,2) to (9,1).

But we moved LEFT instead.

So initial positions:

Head: (9,2)
Body: [ (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5) ]

After moving LEFT to (8,2):

Head: (8,2)
New body segments inserted at front: [ (8,2), (9,2) ]
Then remove tail (7,5).

So new body is [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]

Wait no—the snake's body follows the path. Each time you move, the head moves, and each segment follows.

But to clarify:

Snake starts at positions [ (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2) ]—no, that can't be right because direction is DOWN. Wait, no—if the head is at (9,2), and it's moving down, the next segment would be (9,1), but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Actually, in snake games, the body follows the path of where the head has been. So as you move, each segment moves to the position of the previous one.

So when starting at (9,2) and facing DOWN, moving once down would make the head go to (9,1), with the rest following.

But in our case, we moved LEFT instead, so the first move is LEFT to (8,2).

Therefore, the body after this move would be [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]—no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the snake as a list where each element is the position of each segment. The head is at index 0, followed by the rest in order.

So initially, the snake is facing DOWN, with segments:

Index 0: (9,2)
Index 1: (9,3)
Index 2: (9,4)
Index 3: (9,5)
Index 4: (8,5)
Index 5: (7,5)

But when moving LEFT from (9,2), the new head is at (8,2). The body segments then update as follows:

- Index 0 becomes (8,2)
- Index 1 takes the previous Index 0's position: (9,2)
- Index 2 takes Index 1's old position: (9,3)
- And so on.

But also, since we're moving forward, if it's a straight move without eating, the tail is lost. But in this case, after moving LEFT, we haven't eaten any apple yet, so the tail is at Index 5, which would be removed unless an apple was eaten.

Wait, but actually, in standard snake movement, each segment follows the one in front of it, and the last segment (tail) disappears if no food is eaten.

So moving LEFT from (9,2):

- New head: (8,2)
- Previous head (9,2) becomes next segment.
- Segments 1-4 shift accordingly.
- Tail at (7,5) is removed because no food was eaten.

Thus, after the move, the snake's body is:

Head: (8,2)
Body segments: [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]

So tail is now at (8,5). Wait, no—the tail should be the last segment after movement.

Wait, no. If you have a snake moving, each move shifts all segments forward by one, with the head moving in the new direction, and the tail either stays or moves depending on whether food was eaten.

But if the snake doesn't eat food, the tail moves forward, effectively shortening the snake? No, wait—no. The length remains same unless food is eaten. So when you move without eating, all segments shift: head moves, each segment takes the position of the previous one, and the last segment (tail) disappears.

Wait no—the snake's body follows the path. If it doesn't eat, the tail moves forward as well, so length remains same.

So initial body after moving LEFT:

Head: (8,2)
Body segments: [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]

Because we added a new head at (8,2), shifted the rest forward, and removed the old tail at (7,5). So body is now 5 segments long, from (8,2) to (8,5).

Wait that can't be right because moving LEFT from (9,2), the next position would have the head at (8,2), then the rest follow: (9,2), (9,3), etc., but that seems like a U-turn.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to visualize:

- Start: head at (9,2), body follows down towards increasing y.
- After moving LEFT once: head is at (8,2), body now is [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]—but this would mean the snake's body is overlapping with itself?

Wait no—if you move left from (9,2), you're moving west, so x decreases. So new head is at (8,2). Then the next segment was previously at (9,2), now moves to where the head was: (8,2)? No.

I think I'm getting confused with how the body segments move.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each move as follows:

- The snake has a list of coordinates representing its body. The first element is the head, followed by the rest.
- When moving in any direction, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment (except for the head, which moves according to the chosen direction).
- If food is eaten, the tail doesn't move; otherwise, it does.

So initial positions:

Snake: [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5) ]

After moving LEFT:

Head moves from (9,2) to (8,2).

Each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one.

So new snake becomes:

[ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5) ]

Because the tail was at (7,5), but since no food was eaten, it moves to (8,5)—wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no—if you have a snake of length 6 (head + 5 body segments), moving without eating would mean all segments shift forward. So after moving LEFT:

Head: (8,2)
Next segment: previous head position (9,2)
Next: (9,3) moves to (9,2)'s old position.
Wait no—no, each segment follows the one in front.

So after moving LEFT:

- Head is at (8,2)
- The next segment was at (9,2), so now it's at (8,2). Wait that can't be; you can't have two segments at same position except for overlapping which isn't allowed unless food is eaten.

This suggests a problem—if the snake moves in a direction causing its body to overlap without eating, it dies. But in our case, moving LEFT from (9,2) would cause the head to be at (8,2), and the next segment was previously at (9,2). So unless we eat, this is impossible because the segments can't occupy same space.

Therefore, such a move isn't allowed—unless food is present. But in our problem statement, it's just navigating; there might be food or not.

Wait no—if you're moving LEFT from (9,2) and there's no food at (8,2), then the head can move to (8,2), but the segment that was at (9,2) would have nowhere to go because the tail is also moving—so unless you eat food, you cannot make such a turn without causing your body to overlap.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can only turn in ways that don't cause self-collision. So from direction DOWN, turning LEFT or RIGHT is allowed as long as it doesn't cause the head to move into its own body.

But when you're at (9,2), facing down, moving left would require checking if (8,2) is free—i.e., not part of the body behind.

In our case, the initial snake is:

Positions: [ (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2) ]

Head at (9,2). So moving LEFT to (8,2):

Is (8,2) part of the body? The body segments are [(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)], so (8,2) is not part of the body—so it's safe.

So head moves to (8,2). Then each segment moves:

New head: (8,2)
Next segment: (9,2)
Then: (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)
Tail: (8,5) is removed because no food was eaten.

Wait, that can't be—because the initial body after moving LEFT would have:

Snake: [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]

Because the tail at (7,5) is removed. So length remains same.

But when you move again to go up from (8,2), which direction are you facing? You were moving LEFT initially.

Wait no—after moving LEFT once, your new head is at (8,2), and your body follows as [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]—wait that's a problem because the segment after (8,2) is now (9,2). So to move up from (8,2), which is direction UP, you have to check if the next position (8,3) is safe.

But your body segments are [ (8,2), (9,2), ... ]—so as long as (8,3) isn't in the body beyond the head, it's okay.

Wait, I think this is getting too complicated. Maybe better to model each move step by step.

1. Initial snake positions:
   - Head: (9,2)
   - Body: [ (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5) ]

2. Move LEFT to (8,2):
   - New head: (8,2)
   - Check if (8,2) is in the body beyond the head? The body is [ (9,3), ... ] so no.
   - Update snake:
     - Remove tail at (7,5)
     - Add new head at (8,2)
   - Snake becomes: [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ]

Wait, that's 5 segments now—head plus four body parts.

3. Next move is UP from (8,2):
   - New head position: (8,3)
   - Check if (8,3) is in the snake beyond the head? Current body after head is [ (9,2), ... ] so no.
   - Update snake:
     - Remove tail at (9,5)
     - Add new head at (8,3)
   - Snake becomes: [ (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

Wait, that seems like it's wrapping around. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving UP from (8,2), the snake can't move because its body is behind in a way that would cause collision?

Wait no—if you're at (8,2) and your body segments are [ (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) ] after first move. Moving UP to (8,3) doesn't collide with any of those positions except for the head.

Because the next segment is (9,2), which is one row down and same column as the new head (8,3)—so it's in a different x-coordinate.

Therefore, moving up is safe.

So after second move:

Snake: [ (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) ]

Continuing this way, each time moving UP and checking if the new position is not part of the body beyond the head.

Therefore, it's possible to navigate up to (8,7) without collision as long as we don't reverse direction into our own body.

Thus, the path from (9,2) LEFT then UP to (8,7) is feasible.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at coordinates (9, 2) to a target position at (8, 7) on a grid. The movement of the snake must be such that it does not collide with its own body unless food is eaten.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (9, 2) and extends downward in the initial direction. Its body segments are positioned at coordinates [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
2. **First Move**: The snake moves LEFT to position (8, 2). This move is valid because it does not cause any collision with its own body.
3. **Subsequent Moves**: After moving LEFT, the snake changes direction and starts moving UP towards the target position (8, 7). Each subsequent move checks for potential collisions with the snake's body to ensure safe navigation.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initialize the snake's starting positions
snake = [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]
directions = {'left': (-1, 0), 'right': (1, 0), 'up': (0, 1), 'down': (0, -1)}

# Move the snake left
new_head = (snake[0][0] + directions['left'][0], snake[0][1] + directions['left'][1])
if new_head not in snake[1:]:
    snake.insert(0, new_head)
    snake.pop()

# Now move the snake up to reach (8,7)
target = (8, 7)
current_pos = new_head
while current_pos != target:
    # Calculate possible next positions
    next_positions = [(current_pos[0] + dx, current_pos[1] + dy) for dx, dy in directions.values()]
    
    # Choose the direction that moves towards the target without collision
    for pos in next_positions:
        if pos == (target[0], target[1]):
            move_dir = (pos[0] - current_pos[0], pos[1] - current_pos[1])
            new_head = (current_pos[0] + move_dir[0], current_pos[1] + move_dir[1])
            if new_head not in snake[1:]:
                snake.insert(0, new_head)
                snake.pop()
                current_pos = new_head
                break

print("Snake reached target position:", target)
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The snake starts at (9, 2) with its body extending downward. This is represented by the list `snake`.
- **First Move LEFT**: The snake moves from (9, 2) to (8, 2). This move is valid as it does not collide with any part of the body.
- **Subsequent Moves UP**: After moving LEFT, the snake changes direction and starts moving upward. Each move checks if the new head position will cause a collision with the body segments beyond the head. If safe, the head moves to the new position, and the tail segment is removed to maintain the length of the snake.
- **Target Achievement**: The loop continues until the snake's head reaches the target position (8, 7). Each move ensures that the snake does not collide with itself, allowing it to navigate successfully to the target.

This approach ensures that the snake navigates from its starting position to the target without self-collision by carefully checking each potential move.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (9, 2) and whose body cells are in list format [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (8, 7). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
