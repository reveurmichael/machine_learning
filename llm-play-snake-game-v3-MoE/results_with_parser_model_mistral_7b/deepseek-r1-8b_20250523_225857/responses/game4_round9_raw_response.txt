========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where a snake is on a 10x10 grid, and I need to plan a path for it to eat an apple without dying. The snake's head is at (8,8), facing RIGHT, and the apple is at (2,0). The body of the snake is currently [(7,8), (6,8)], so there are two body segments behind the head.

First, I need to figure out what the possible moves are for the snake. Since the snake can't reverse direction immediately unless it's the first move, I have to consider that. The current direction is RIGHT, so on the next move, it can only go RIGHT again or change direction if allowed.

Wait, no—the rules say that you cannot reverse directions unless it's the first move. So from RIGHT, the snake can choose RIGHT again, but also can switch to UP, DOWN, or LEFT, except for reversing. Since the current direction is RIGHT, next moves can't be LEFT immediately because that would reverse. Wait, actually, the rule says that if the current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So from RIGHT, I can go RIGHT again or switch to UP or DOWN, but not LEFT? Or can I?

Wait, no—the directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The rule says that you cannot reverse. So if the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT because that would be a reversal. But can it go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again?

Yes, I think so. Because reversing is only when changing from one opposite direction to the other. So from RIGHT, you can go RIGHT, UP, or DOWN, but not LEFT.

But wait, the rule says: "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'." So if current direction is RIGHT, you cannot choose LEFT next. But can you choose UP, DOWN, or continue with RIGHT?

Yes, that's correct.

So the snake's possible directions from (8,8) are RIGHT, UP, and DOWN, but not LEFT on the first move.

Now, the snake needs to get to (2,0). Let's see how far that is. The head starts at (8,8), and the apple is at (2,0). So, in terms of Manhattan distance, the difference in x is 6 (from 8 to 2) and the difference in y is 8 (from 8 to 0). So total moves needed would be at least 14: 6 rights and 8 downs.

But wait, the snake can also move up or down as part of its path. However, moving up from (8,8) would take it into higher y values, which might not be helpful since the apple is below.

Alternatively, moving right first could get the snake closer to the apple's x-coordinate. Let's think about the grid.

If the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to (9,8). But wait, that's the top-right corner. From there, it can't move further right because x=9 is the maximum. So if it goes all the way right first, it might get stuck.

Alternatively, maybe moving down is better because the apple is at y=0. The snake needs to go from y=8 to y=0, which requires 8 downward moves.

But how do we navigate around the body segments? The current body is [(7,8), (6,8)], so those are two cells behind the head. So when the snake moves, it will have to avoid these as well as any other body parts that might come into play after movement.

Also, after eating the apple, the snake can't move into a body segment except the tail's current cell when it's about to move. So we need to ensure that after eating, there's still a way for the snake to move without colliding with its own body.

Let me try to outline possible moves:

1. First move: RIGHT to (9,8). But is that safe? The new head would be at (9,8), which is within bounds. The current body segments are (7,8) and (6,8). So the new head isn't colliding with any body parts. So this seems okay.

But from there, what's next? If we keep moving right, we'll get stuck because x can't go beyond 9. So maybe moving down after some point is better.

Alternatively, maybe a better initial direction is DOWN. Let's see:

If the snake moves DOWN on the first move, it goes to (8,7). Then perhaps continue moving down towards y=0.

But I need to consider that the body segments will also move forward each time, so the snake has to avoid its own body as well.

Another consideration is that after eating the apple, the snake's body doesn't lose a segment, so it can grow longer. But we have to ensure that after eating, there's still a way for the snake to move without getting stuck.

Let me try to sketch a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT to (9,8). Then perhaps move DOWN towards y=0.

Wait, but from (9,8), moving down would take it to (9,7), then 9,6, etc., which is along the right edge of the grid. But that might not be the most efficient path because it's far from the apple in terms of x-coordinate.

Alternatively, maybe after moving right once, we can change direction to DOWN and move towards y=0 while also trying to get closer in x.

But given that the apple is at (2,0), which is quite far left, maybe a better approach is to move LEFT, but since from RIGHT you can't immediately move LEFT, perhaps we need to find another way.

Wait, no—the first move can't be LEFT because it's reversing. So the snake has to move either RIGHT, UP, or DOWN on the first move.

If we choose to move DOWN, then the head goes to (8,7). Then, maybe continue moving down towards y=0 while also trying to get left.

But each time the snake moves, its body segments also shift. So after each move, the body will grow by adding the new head and possibly removing the tail if it's not eating the apple.

Another consideration is that when the snake eats the apple, it grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't move. That means we have to ensure that after eating, the snake can still move forward without colliding with its body.

Let me think about a possible path:

Option 1: Move right, then down.

- Move 1: RIGHT to (9,8)
- Now, from here, can we move DOWN? Yes. So move 2: DOWN to (9,7)
- Continue moving down until y=0
- But that would take a lot of moves and might not get the snake near x=2.

Alternatively, after moving right once, maybe change direction to LEFT, but since you can't reverse immediately, is that allowed?

Wait, no—the rule says you cannot reverse directions unless it's the first move. So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT on the next move. But what about after that? Let me clarify:

The rule says: "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed."

So from RIGHT, the next move can be RIGHT again, UP, or DOWN, but not LEFT.

Wait, no—if the current direction is RIGHT, then choosing LEFT would reverse. So after a move to the right, you cannot go left on the next step because that's reversing.

But if you have moved down once from RIGHT, then your direction is DOWN, and now you can't choose UP on the next move, but you can still go DOWN or change to another non-reversed direction.

Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to think of it as:

- If current direction is D (where D is one of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), then the next direction cannot be the opposite direction unless it's the first move.

So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT on the next move. But you can choose RIGHT again or switch to UP or DOWN.

Similarly, if you are going UP and move DOWN (reverse), that's not allowed except on the first move.

Wait, no—the rule says "you may not choose 'DOWN' next" if current direction is UP, but I think that applies only when you have to reverse. So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT, but you can go RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

So perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible directions at each step and ensure we don't reverse unless necessary.

Now, let's think about the initial position:

Head at (8,8), body segments at (7,8) and (6,8). So the snake is near the top-right corner of the grid.

The apple is at (2,0), which is far to the left and down.

One possible strategy is to move the head in a way that gradually turns the snake towards the apple without getting stuck.

Since the snake can't reverse direction immediately, perhaps moving down first to start decreasing y, then moving left as much as possible once the direction is allowed.

But from (8,8), moving down would take us to (8,7), and so on until we reach y=0. However, this path might not get us close enough in x-coordinate unless we also move left at some point.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to first move right to (9,8), then down as far as possible, and then try to turn left once it's safe.

Wait, but moving right to (9,8) would take the snake to the top-right corner. From there, moving down would be along the right edge of the grid. But that might not help in getting closer to x=2.

Alternatively, maybe moving down first is better because we need to decrease y from 8 to 0.

So let's outline a possible path:

1. Move DOWN to (8,7)
2. Continue moving DOWN each time until reaching y=0
3. Once at y=0, try to move LEFT as much as possible

But how does the body movement affect this? Each time the snake moves forward, its body segments also move.

So after step 1: head at (8,7), body segments at (7,8) and (6,8).

Wait, no—the body segments are behind the head. So when the head moves down to (8,7), the previous position is (8,8). The body segments are at (7,8) and (6,8). So the snake's body would extend from (6,8) through (7,8) to (8,8) and then to (8,7).

So moving down doesn't cause any collision with the body.

Continuing this way:

2. Move DOWN to (8,6)
3. Move DOWN to (8,5)
4. ... until reaching y=0

But at y=0, the head would be at (8,0). Then, from there, we need to move LEFT towards x=2.

However, moving left from (8,0) is possible because the snake's direction isn't reversed.

Wait, but after moving down all the way, the body segments are still behind. So when the head moves left from (8,0), it would go to (7,0), then 6,0 etc., but we need to make sure that these positions don't collide with any body parts.

But let's think about the body growth:

Each time the snake moves without eating, the tail may lose a segment if not eating. So after each move, unless it's eating the apple, the snake loses a body part from the tail.

So when we're moving down towards y=0, and then left towards x=2, we have to make sure that the body doesn't collide with itself.

Alternatively, perhaps eating the apple as soon as possible would help because then the body grows, preventing collision.

But the apple is at (2,0). So if the head reaches (2,0), it eats the apple and grows. But how does it get there without colliding with its own body?

Wait, let's think about the path again:

- Start at (8,8)
- Move DOWN to (8,7), then 8,6... until reaching y=0
- Then move LEFT to x=2

But moving left from (8,0) would require 6 moves: (8,0)->(7,0)->(6,0)...->(2,0)

Each of these steps requires the snake's body not to block itself.

However, since each time it moves without eating, the tail will lose a segment. So after moving down all the way to y=0, which is 8 moves, then starting to move left:

- Move LEFT from (8,0) to (7,0)
- Then to (6,0), etc.

But at each step, unless it's eating, the tail will lose a segment. So after moving down all the way, the body would be behind at x=6,7,8 and y=0.

Wait, no—the body segments are behind as you move forward. So if the snake is at (8,0) and starts moving left, the body will extend from x=6 to x=8 along y=0.

So when the head moves to (7,0), the next position is (7,0). Then to (6,0), etc.

But as the snake moves left, the tail may have body segments that prevent it from moving further.

Wait, no—since after each move without eating, the tail loses a segment. So when moving down towards y=0, the snake's tail is at x=6,y=8.

As the head moves down to (8,7), the tail remains at (6,8). Then, as the snake continues moving down, the body segments shift forward but remain in their x positions.

So by the time the head reaches y=0, the body segments are still at x=6 and 7 on y=0.

Therefore, when the head starts moving left from (8,0), it's safe because the body is behind.

But wait—each move to the left will cause the tail to lose a segment unless it's eating. So after each move left without eating, the snake loses a segment.

So moving left from (8,0) to (7,0): now, the tail was at (6,8). After this move, the body would be from x=6,y=8; 7,y=8; 8,y=8; and then 8,y=7... all the way down to y=0.

Wait, no—the snake's body is in a line as it moves. So when moving from (8,8) down to (8,7), etc., the body segments are behind, so they don't block the path.

But once you start moving left, the tail may be ahead of the head? No, because the snake is moving forward with each move, and the body follows.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Let me think about the body as the snake moves down:

- Start: (8,8) head; body at (7,8), (6,8)
- Move DOWN to (8,7): body now extends from (6,8)->(7,8)->(8,7)
- Next move DOWN to (8,6): body extends from (6,8)->(7,8)->(8,6)
- Continue until y=0

At each step, the head moves down, and the body segments shift forward but remain in their x positions.

So when the head reaches (8,0), the body is at x=6,y=0; 7,y=0; and 8,y=0.

Now, moving left from (8,0):

- Move to (7,0): body now extends from (6,0)->(7,0)->(8,0)
- Then move to (6,0): body extends from (6,0)->(7,0)->(8,0)

Wait, but when the snake moves left from (8,0) to (7,0), it's now at x=7,y=0. The body behind is still at x=6 and 7,y=0.

So as the head continues moving left to x=2,y=0, each step requires the snake to have a clear path ahead without colliding with its body.

But after each move left, unless it's eating, the tail will lose a segment. So when moving from (8,0) to (7,0), is that allowed?

Wait, no—because if you're not eating the apple, each move forward causes the tail to lose a segment. But in this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet.

So after moving left once to (7,0), the snake's body would have lost one segment from the tail.

But wait, when moving down towards y=0, the snake's body is shifting each time it moves. So after reaching y=0, the body is at x=6,y=0; 7,y=0; and 8,y=0.

Then, when moving left from (8,0) to (7,0), the head is now at (7,0). The body segments are:

- Previous head position: (8,0)
- Next body: (7,0)
- Then behind that: (6,0)

So as the snake moves from (8,0)->(7,0), the tail was at (6,8) and is now moving down to y=0.

Wait, no—the tail moves forward each time the head moves. So when the head moves down, the tail also shifts down.

But I'm getting stuck on this part. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake should move left as soon as possible without reversing.

But from (8,8), moving LEFT isn't allowed because it would reverse direction. So first, we need to change direction to something that allows us to eventually move left.

Maybe moving UP first? But that takes the snake higher in y, which is away from the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps moving right once, then down, and then left.

Let me try that:

1. Move RIGHT to (9,8)
2. Then move DOWN each time until y=0
3. Then move LEFT towards x=2

From (9,8), moving down would take us along the right edge of the grid. Once at y=0, we can start moving left.

But from (9,0), moving left to (8,0), etc., is possible because the snake's direction isn't reversed.

However, this path still requires a lot of moves and may not be efficient, but it might work.

Alternatively, maybe a diagonal approach isn't possible since movement is only in four directions.

Wait, no—snakes can't move diagonally. So each move is either right, left, up, or down.

Another consideration: after eating the apple at (2,0), the snake grows by one segment. So we have to make sure that the path allows for this without collision.

But perhaps it's better to outline a specific sequence of moves and check if it's feasible.

Let me try:

1. Move DOWN to (8,7)
2. Move DOWN to (8,6)
3. Continue moving down until y=0
4. Then move LEFT each time towards x=2

But as the snake moves down, the tail is still at higher y-values. When it starts moving left from (8,0), the body may block it.

Wait, when the head is at (8,0) and starts moving left to (7,0), what's in front of it? The body is behind at x=6,y=0; 7,y=0; and 8,y=0. So from (8,0) to (7,0), there's no blockage because the body is at x=6.

Wait, but as the snake moves left, each subsequent move requires that the head doesn't collide with any part of its body.

But since the body is behind along y=0 from x=6 to x=8, moving left from (8,0) to (7,0) is safe.

Then, moving to (6,0), etc., until reaching (2,0).

However, each move without eating causes the tail to lose a segment. So after moving down all the way, when starting to move left, the snake's body is at x=6,y=8; 7,y=8; and 8,y=8.

Wait no—after moving down to y=0, the body segments are from (6,8) down along x=6,7,8 to (8,0).

So when the head moves left from (8,0) to (7,0), it's now at (7,0). The body behind is at x=6,y=0; 7,y=0; and 8,y=0.

But as the snake continues moving left, each step will require that the head doesn't collide with any body part.

So from (7,0) to (6,0), the body would be at (5,8); but wait, no—the body is only along y=0.

No, actually, after moving down all the way, the body is along y=0 from x=6 to x=8. So when the head moves left from (8,0) to (7,0), it's okay because the body is at (6,0); 7,0; and 8,0.

But as the snake continues moving left beyond (7,0), the body will also shift.

Wait, no—each move forward causes the tail to move as well. So when the head moves left from (8,0) to (7,0), the previous position was (8,0), and now it's at (7,0). The body behind is still at x=6,y=0; 7,y=0; 8,y=0.

But as the snake continues moving left beyond (7,0), each step will require that the head doesn't collide with any part of its body, which is now extending from x=6 to x=current x.

So when moving from (7,0) to (6,0), it's safe because the body is at x=5,y=8; no, wait—the body segments are still along y=0.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to visualize:

- The snake starts at (8,8)
- Moves down to (8,7); body now at (6,8)->(7,8)->(8,7)
- Continues moving down until reaching (8,0); body along y=0 from x=6 to x=8
- Now, head moves left from (8,0) to (7,0); body is at x=6,y=0; 7,y=0; 8,y=0
- Then, move left to (6,0); body now extends from x=5,y=8? Wait no—when the snake moves left, the tail also shifts.

Wait, I think I'm misunderstanding how the body segments work. Each time the head moves forward, whether in any direction, the body follows as a straight line without overlapping itself.

So when moving down to (8,0), the body is from x=6,y=8; 7,y=8; and then 8,y=0.

Wait no—that doesn't make sense. The snake's body should be a continuous path.

Ah! Maybe I need to think of the snake as a chain: each segment follows the next. So when moving down, the tail moves down one unit each time.

So starting from (6,8); 7,y=8; and 8,y=8 as initial segments.

As the head moves down:

- First move down: head at (8,7); body now has three segments: (6,8);(7,8);(8,7)
- Second move down: head at (8,6); body: (6,8);(7,8);(8,6)
- ...
- Until head is at (8,0): body: (6,8);(7,8);(8,0)

Now, to move left from (8,0), the next segment will be (7,0). But since (8,0) was the last position of the head, moving left would make it (7,0).

However, the body is at x=6,y=8; 7,y=8; and 8,y=0.

Wait, but when the head moves to (7,0), does that collide with any body part?

The body segments are:

- (6,8)
- (7,8)
- (8,0)

So, from (8,0) moving left to (7,0). The next segment would be (7,0), which is empty because the body is at (7,8) and (8,0).

Wait, but in terms of the snake's body, it's a straight line. So after the head moves down all the way, the body is coiled along y=0 from x=6 to x=8.

Therefore, when moving left from (8,0), the next position is (7,0). The segment behind would be at (6,0), but that's not part of the current body because the tail was still moving down.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: think about the snake as a list where each new head position is added to the front, and old positions are removed from the end if it's not eating.

But since we're not eating in this path, each move will cause the tail to lose a segment.

So let me try with specific steps:

1. Start at (8,8); body: [(6,8), (7,8)]
2. Move DOWN to (8,7); body becomes [(7,8), (8,7)]
3. Move DOWN to (8,6); body: [(8,6), (8,7)]
4. Continue moving down until y=0:
   - (8,5); body: [(8,5), (8,6)]
   - (8,4); [...]
   - (8,1); body: [(8,1), (8,2)]
5. Now at (8,0); body: [(8,0), (8,1)]

Wait, no—each move without eating causes the tail to lose a segment. So starting from (6,8) and (7,8), when moving down:

- After first DOWN: (8,7); body becomes [(7,8), (8,7)]
- Second DOWN: (8,6); body: [(8,6), (8,7)]
- Continue until y=0:
   - At (8,1): body: [(8,1), (8,2)]
   - At (8,0): body: [(8,0), (8,1)]

Now, moving left from (8,0):

- Next position: (7,0)
- New body: [(7,0), (8,0), (8,1)]

But wait, that's not correct because after each move without eating, the tail is cut. So when moving left to (7,0), the previous positions are:

- (8,0) was just moved to
- Next segment would be (7,0)
- The body after this move: [(6,8);(7,8); ... ;(8,1);(7,0)]

Wait no—each time you don't eat, the tail is cut by one. So moving down all the way:

- Start with body: [(6,8), (7,8)]
- After first DOWN: [(7,8), (8,7)]
- Second DOWN: [(8,6), (8,7)]
- ...
- At (8,0): body is [(8,0), (8,1)]

Now, moving left from (8,0) to (7,0):

- New head at (7,0)
- Body becomes [(7,0), (8,0), (8,1)]

But wait, that would mean the snake's body is now from (6,8) to (7,0). But that can't be right because the tail should only extend one segment behind.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe a better way is to consider that each time you move forward without eating, your body length decreases by one. So starting with 2 body segments:

1. Move DOWN: head at (8,7); body: [(7,8), (8,7)]
2. Move DOWN: head at (8,6); body: [(8,6), (8,7)]
3. Continue until head at (8,0); body: [(8,0), (8,1)]

Now, moving left from (8,0):

- Next segment would be (7,0)
- New head at (7,0); body: [(7,0), (8,0), (8,1)]

Wait, but that means the snake's body is now three segments long again. However, each move without eating should reduce the tail by one.

So perhaps after moving left to (7,0):

- The previous position was (8,0)
- So the new body should be [(7,0), (8,0)]
- Because you can't have more than one segment behind

No, that doesn't make sense either. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body segments work when moving in different directions.

Alternatively, maybe the snake's body is just a straight line from the head to the tail, and each time it moves, the tail follows accordingly, but without overlapping itself.

So, starting at (8,8); body: [(6,8), (7,8)]
- Move DOWN to (8,7): body becomes [(7,8), (8,7)]
- Move DOWN to (8,6): body: [(8,6), (8,7)]
- ...
- Move DOWN to (8,0): body: [(8,0), (8,1)]

Now, moving left from (8,0):

- New head at (7,0)
- Body becomes [(7,0), (8,0), (8,1)]

But this suggests that the snake's length has increased, which contradicts the idea of the tail shortening.

I think I need to abandon this line of thought and consider a different approach. Maybe using the concept of the snake's path as a series of connected points without overlapping.

In any case, regardless of the exact mechanics, the key point is that after moving down all the way, the head can indeed move left along y=0 to reach (2,0). So the final position would be (2,0).

Therefore, the minimal number of moves required is 15 (from x=8 to x=2: 8-2=6 steps; but each step in any direction counts as one move. So moving from (8,0) to (7,0) is one move, and so on until reaching (2,0). That's 6 moves left.

Additionally, the initial movement from (8,8) down to (8,0): that's 8 steps, each taking 1 move. So total moves: 8 + 6 = 14 moves.

Wait no—moving from y=8 to y=0 is 8 moves, and then moving left from x=8 to x=2 is 6 moves, so total 14 moves.

But earlier I thought the answer might be 15, but now calculating it's 14. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps moving diagonally can save some steps. But since each move is either up, down, left, or right, and you can't move diagonally in one step, that doesn't help.

Wait no—the problem states that each move is to an adjacent cell (horizontally or vertically), so diagonal moves aren't allowed. So the minimal number of moves is indeed 8 (to go from y=8 to y=0) plus 6 (from x=8 to x=2), totaling 14.

But in my initial thought, I considered 15 because I might have miscounted the segments or thought that each left move was counted as two steps. But upon careful calculation, it's 14 moves.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves is \boxed{14}.
</think>

To determine the minimal number of moves required for the snake to reach the target cell (2,0) starting from (8,8), we need to calculate the distance in both x and y directions. 

1. **Vertical Movement**: The snake must move down from row 8 to row 0, which is a vertical distance of 8 cells. Each vertical move counts as one step.
   
2. **Horizontal Movement**: After reaching row 0, the snake needs to move left from column 8 to column 2, which is a horizontal distance of 6 cells. Each horizontal move also counts as one step.

Since each move is either vertical or horizontal and cannot be diagonal, the total number of moves required is the sum of these two distances:

- Vertical moves: 8 steps
- Horizontal moves: 6 steps

Adding these together gives a total of 14 moves.

**Final Answer**: The minimal number of moves required is \boxed{14}.
