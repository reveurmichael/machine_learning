# Web Scraping Tutorial: Extracting Quotes from quotes.toscrape.com

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the `llm_selenium_agent` package to scrape quotes from [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/). By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a functional script that extracts quotes, authors, tags, and can navigate through multiple pages.

## Introduction to Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. It allows you to gather structured data from web pages that can be saved and analyzed. There are many use cases for web scraping, including:

- Data mining for research or business intelligence
- Price monitoring and comparison
- Content aggregation
- Social media monitoring
- Market research
- Lead generation

While web scraping is powerful, it's important to use it responsibly and ethically. Always check a website's terms of service and robots.txt file before scraping, and be mindful of the load your scraper puts on the server.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- The `llm_selenium_agent` package installed (follow the installation instructions in the README.md)
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Basic understanding of HTML/CSS (we'll cover the essentials as we go)
- A modern web browser (Chrome recommended as we'll be using ChromeDriver)

## Setting Up the Environment

First, make sure you've completed the setup for the `llm_selenium_agent` package. Run the first-time setup command if you haven't already:

```bash
llm_selenium_agent_first_time_setup
```

This will install the necessary WebDrivers for Chrome and Firefox browsers. You can verify the installation by running the Streamlit app:

```bash
llm_selenium_agent_streamlit_app
```

## Web Scraping Fundamentals

Before diving into the specifics of our quotes scraper, let's understand some fundamental concepts of web scraping using Selenium.

### What is Selenium?

Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. Originally developed for testing web applications, it has become popular for web scraping because it can:

1. Execute JavaScript and interact with dynamic content
2. Fill in forms and click buttons
3. Handle authentication
4. Navigate between pages
5. Capture screenshots

Unlike simple HTTP request-based scrapers (like those using Requests and BeautifulSoup), Selenium actually opens a browser and interacts with websites just like a human would.

### Key Selenium Concepts

#### WebDriver

The WebDriver is the core component that controls the browser. In this tutorial, we'll use ChromeDriver to control Google Chrome. The `llm_selenium_agent` package handles the WebDriver setup for you.

#### Locating Elements

To interact with elements on a web page, you first need to locate them. Selenium provides several methods to find elements:

- **By ID**: Find an element by its `id` attribute
- **By Name**: Find an element by its `name` attribute
- **By Class Name**: Find an element by its CSS class
- **By Tag Name**: Find an element by its HTML tag
- **By CSS Selector**: Find an element using CSS selectors
- **By XPath**: Find an element using XPath expressions
- **By Link Text**: Find a link by its text
- **By Partial Link Text**: Find a link by part of its text

Here's a quick example of how these locators work:

```python
# Finding an element by ID
element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "login")

# Finding an element by Class Name
element = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "quote")

# Finding an element by CSS Selector
element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.quote span.text")

# Finding an element by XPath
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@class='quote']/span[@class='text']")
```

#### Waiting for Elements

Web pages often load content dynamically or take time to render. Selenium provides mechanisms to wait for elements to appear:

- **Implicit Waits**: Tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find any element
- **Explicit Waits**: Wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding

We'll use explicit waits in our scraper:

```python
# Wait for an element to be present
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "quote"))
)
```

#### Interacting with Elements

Once you've located an element, you can interact with it in various ways:

- Click it
- Send keys (type text)
- Clear text
- Get its text or attribute values
- Check if it's displayed or enabled

#### Navigating Between Pages

Selenium can navigate between pages using:

- `driver.get(url)` to load a URL
- `driver.back()` to go back
- `driver.forward()` to go forward
- `driver.refresh()` to refresh the page

Now that we understand the basics, let's dive into our quotes scraper!

## Understanding the Website Structure

Before we start coding, let's analyze the structure of [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/). This step is crucial for any web scraping project as it helps us identify the HTML elements we need to target.

### HTML and CSS Basics for Web Scraping

If you're new to web development, here's a quick primer on HTML and CSS, which is essential for web scraping:

#### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It uses elements (tags) to define the structure and content of a web page. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text</p>
    <div class="container">
      <span id="special-text">This is special</span>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Key points about HTML:

- Elements are defined by tags like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`
- Tags usually come in pairs with an opening `<tag>` and closing `</tag>`
- Elements can have attributes like `id`, `class`, `href`, etc.
- Elements can be nested inside other elements, creating a hierarchical structure

#### CSS Selectors

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling web pages, but CSS selectors are extremely useful for locating elements when scraping. Here are some common CSS selectors:

- `element`: Selects all elements of that type (e.g., `div` selects all `<div>` elements)
- `.class`: Selects elements with a specific class (e.g., `.quote` selects all elements with `class="quote"`)
- `#id`: Selects an element with a specific id (e.g., `#login` selects the element with `id="login"`)
- `element.class`: Selects elements of a specific type with a specific class (e.g., `div.quote` selects all `<div>` elements with `class="quote"`)
- `parent > child`: Selects direct child elements (e.g., `div > span` selects all `<span>` elements that are direct children of `<div>` elements)
- `ancestor descendant`: Selects all descendants (e.g., `div span` selects all `<span>` elements inside `<div>` elements, regardless of depth)
- `element[attribute=value]`: Selects elements with a specific attribute value (e.g., `a[href="https://example.com"]` selects all `<a>` elements with that specific href)

#### The DOM (Document Object Model)

The DOM is the programming interface for HTML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. When we use Selenium, we're interacting with the DOM.

### Inspecting the Quotes Website

Now, let's examine the structure of quotes.toscrape.com. Open the website in your browser and use the browser's developer tools (Right-click > Inspect or F12) to explore the HTML.

Looking at the page, we can see:

1. The website has a simple structure with quotes displayed in a list format
2. Each quote is contained within a `<div class="quote">` element
3. Inside each quote div, we find:
   - The quote text in a `<span class="text">` element
   - The author name in a `<small class="author">` element
   - A link to the author's page in an `<a>` element
   - Tags in `<a class="tag">` elements within a `<div class="tags">` container
4. At the bottom of the page, there's a navigation section with "Next" and "Previous" links

Here's a simplified version of the HTML structure for a single quote:

```html
<div class="quote" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">
    <span class="text" itemprop="text">"The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking."</span>
    <span>by <small class="author" itemprop="author">Albert Einstein</small>
    <a href="/author/Albert-Einstein">(about)</a>
    </span>
    <div class="tags">
        Tags:
        <a class="tag" href="/tag/change/page/1/">change</a>
        <a class="tag" href="/tag/deep-thoughts/page/1/">deep-thoughts</a>
        <a class="tag" href="/tag/thinking/page/1/">thinking</a>
        <a class="tag" href="/tag/world/page/1/">world</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

For pagination, we need to look at the navigation section at the bottom:

```html
<nav>
    <ul class="pager">
        <li class="next">
            <a href="/page/2/">Next <span aria-hidden="true">â†’</span></a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

Understanding this structure is crucial for writing our scraper, as we'll use these CSS selectors to locate and extract the data we need.

### XPath: An Alternative Way to Locate Elements

While CSS selectors are powerful, XPath is even more flexible for complex element selection. XPath is a language for finding information in an XML or HTML document. Here are some examples of XPath expressions equivalent to the CSS selectors we'll use:

- CSS: `.quote` | XPath: `//div[@class='quote']`
- CSS: `.quote .text` | XPath: `//div[@class='quote']/span[@class='text']`
- CSS: `.quote .author` | XPath: `//div[@class='quote']/span/small[@class='author']`
- CSS: `.quote .tag` | XPath: `//div[@class='quote']//a[@class='tag']`
- CSS: `li.next > a` | XPath: `//li[@class='next']/a`

In this tutorial, we'll primarily use CSS selectors as they're generally more readable, but it's good to know that XPath is an option for more complex scenarios.

## Creating the Scraper Class

Now that we understand the structure of the website, let's create a Python class that extends `BaseSeleniumChrome` from the `llm_selenium_agent` package. This class will handle the browser automation and data extraction.

```python
from llm_selenium_agent import BaseSeleniumChrome
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
import csv
import time

class QuoteScraper(BaseSeleniumChrome):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.url = "https://quotes.toscrape.com/"
        self.quotes_data = []
    
    def login(self):
        # No login required for this site, but method is required by BaseSelenium
        pass
```

## Extracting Quotes from a Single Page

Now that we have our scraper class set up, let's add a method to extract quotes from the current page. This is where we'll use Selenium's capabilities to interact with the page elements.

### Understanding the Extract Quotes Method

The `extract_quotes_from_page` method is responsible for:
1. Waiting for the quotes to load on the page
2. Finding all quote elements
3. Extracting the text, author, and tags from each quote
4. Storing the data in our `quotes_data` list

Let's break down the method and understand each part:

```python
def extract_quotes_from_page(self):
    """Extract all quotes from the current page."""
    # Wait for quotes to load
    WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "quote"))
    )
    
    # Find all quote elements
    quote_elements = self.driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "quote")
    
    # Process each quote
    for quote_element in quote_elements:
        # Extract text
        text = quote_element.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "text").text
        # Remove quotation marks from the beginning and end
        text = text[1:-1] if text.startswith('"') and text.endswith('"') else text
        
        # Extract author
        author = quote_element.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "author").text
        
        # Extract tags
        tags = [tag.text for tag in quote_element.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "tag")]
        
        # Add to our data list
        self.quotes_data.append({
            'text': text,
            'author': author,
            'tags': tags
        })
        
    print(f"Extracted {len(quote_elements)} quotes from the current page.")
```

#### Waiting for Elements

```python
WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "quote"))
)
```

This line is critical. It tells Selenium to wait up to 10 seconds for at least one element with the class "quote" to appear on the page. This is an example of an **explicit wait**, which is a best practice in Selenium automation. The advantages of explicit waits include:

- Making your scraper more robust against slow-loading pages
- Reducing the chance of "ElementNotFound" errors
- Allowing the page to fully render dynamic content

The `EC` (Expected Conditions) module provides many conditions you can wait for, such as:
- `presence_of_element_located`: Element exists in the DOM
- `visibility_of_element_located`: Element exists and is visible
- `element_to_be_clickable`: Element is visible and enabled
- `text_to_be_present_in_element`: Element contains specific text

#### Finding Multiple Elements

```python
quote_elements = self.driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "quote")
```

This line finds all elements with the class "quote" on the page and returns them as a list. Notice the plural `find_elements` (as opposed to `find_element`), which returns multiple matches. If no elements match, it returns an empty list rather than raising an exception.

#### Extracting Data from Elements

For each quote element, we extract three pieces of information:

1. **The quote text**:
   ```python
   text = quote_element.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "text").text
   ```
   This finds the element with class "text" within the current quote element and gets its text content. The `.text` property returns the visible text of an element.

2. **Cleaning the data**:
   ```python
   text = text[1:-1] if text.startswith('"') and text.endswith('"') else text
   ```
   This line performs data cleaning, removing the quotation marks that surround the quote. Data cleaning is a common step in web scraping, as we often need to process the raw data to make it more usable.

3. **The author name**:
   ```python
   author = quote_element.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "author").text
   ```
   Similar to the quote text, we find the element with class "author" and get its text.

4. **The tags**:
   ```python
   tags = [tag.text for tag in quote_element.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "tag")]
   ```
   This is a list comprehension that gets all elements with class "tag" and extracts their text. The result is a list of tag strings.

#### Storing the Data

```python
self.quotes_data.append({
    'text': text,
    'author': author,
    'tags': tags
})
```

Finally, we store the extracted data in our `quotes_data` list as a dictionary. Using a dictionary makes the data more organized and easier to work with later.

### Advanced Element Interactions

In our simple example, we're only extracting text from elements. However, Selenium can do much more:

#### Getting Attributes

Besides text, you can get any attribute of an element:

```python
# Get the href attribute of a link
author_url = quote_element.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "a").get_attribute("href")
```

#### Checking Element State

You can check if an element is displayed, enabled, or selected:

```python
# Check if an element is visible
is_visible = element.is_displayed()

# Check if a form element is enabled
is_enabled = element.is_enabled()

# Check if a checkbox is selected
is_selected = checkbox.is_selected()
```

#### Taking Screenshots

You can take a screenshot of an element for debugging:

```python
# Take a screenshot of a specific element
element.screenshot("element.png")
```

## Handling Pagination

Many websites display data across multiple pages. To scrape all the data, we need to handle paginationâ€”the process of navigating from one page to the next. Let's add methods to check for a next page and navigate to it:

### Checking for a Next Page

```python
def has_next_page(self):
    """Check if there is a 'Next' page button."""
    try:
        next_button = self.driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "li.next > a")
        return True
    except:
        return False
```

This method checks if there's a "Next" button on the page. We use a CSS selector `"li.next > a"` which targets an `<a>` element that is a direct child of an `<li>` element with class "next". If the element is found, we return `True`; otherwise, we catch the exception and return `False`.

Using a try-except block is a common pattern when checking for the presence of an element that might not exist. An alternative approach would be to use `find_elements` and check if the result list is empty:

```python
def has_next_page_alternative(self):
    """Alternative way to check if there is a 'Next' page button."""
    next_buttons = self.driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "li.next > a")
    return len(next_buttons) > 0
```

### Navigating to the Next Page

```python
def go_to_next_page(self):
    """Navigate to the next page."""
    next_button = self.driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "li.next > a")
    next_button.click()
    
    # Wait for the page to load
    WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "quote"))
    )
    time.sleep(1)  # Add a small delay to ensure page is fully loaded
```

This method clicks the "Next" button and then waits for the next page to load. Notice that we:

1. Find the next button using the same CSS selector as in `has_next_page`
2. Call the `click()` method on the button element, which simulates a user clicking it
3. Wait for the quotes to load on the new page
4. Add a small delay to ensure the page is fully loaded

The `time.sleep(1)` line is a simple way to add a delay, but in production code, you might want to use more sophisticated waiting mechanisms. This delay helps prevent rate limiting and reduces the load on the server.

### Understanding Element Interaction Methods

Selenium provides several methods for interacting with elements:

- `click()`: Clicks the element
- `send_keys("text")`: Types text into the element
- `clear()`: Clears text from the element
- `submit()`: Submits a form (similar to pressing Enter)

Let's explore how we can use these methods with examples:

#### Clicking Elements

```python
# Click a button
button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "submit-button")
button.click()

# Click a link
link = driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "Next")
link.click()
```

#### Entering Text

```python
# Enter text in a search box
search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")
search_box.clear()  # Clear any existing text
search_box.send_keys("selenium tutorial")  # Type new text
```

#### Submitting Forms

```python
# Find the form element
form = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "form")

# Submit the form
form.submit()

# Alternatively, you can press Enter in a form field
search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")
search_box.send_keys("selenium tutorial")
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)  # Press Enter/Return key
```

## Scraping All Pages

Now that we have methods to extract quotes from a page and navigate to the next page, let's create a method to scrape all pages:

```python
def scrape_all_pages(self, max_pages=None):
    """
    Scrape quotes from all pages or up to max_pages.
    
    Args:
        max_pages: Maximum number of pages to scrape. None for all pages.
    """
    page_num = 1
    
    self.navigate_to_url()
    
    while True:
        print(f"Scraping page {page_num}...")
        self.extract_quotes_from_page()
        
        # Take a screenshot of the current page
        self.capture_screenshot()
        
        # Check if we reached the maximum pages
        if max_pages and page_num >= max_pages:
            print(f"Reached maximum pages ({max_pages}). Stopping.")
            break
        
        # Check if there's a next page
        if self.has_next_page():
            self.go_to_next_page()
            page_num += 1
        else:
            print("No more pages to scrape.")
            break
    
    print(f"Scraping completed. Total quotes scraped: {len(self.quotes_data)}")
```

This method:
1. Starts by navigating to the website's URL
2. Extracts quotes from the current page
3. Takes a screenshot for reference (useful for debugging)
4. Checks if we've reached the maximum number of pages (if specified)
5. Checks if there's a next page, and if so, navigates to it
6. Repeats until there are no more pages or we've reached the maximum

The `max_pages` parameter is useful during development or testing when you don't want to scrape the entire website.

### Understanding the Loop Structure

The loop structure in `scrape_all_pages` is a common pattern in web scraping:

```python
while True:
    # Process the current page
    
    # Check if we should stop
    if condition_to_stop:
        break
    
    # Move to the next page
    if has_next_page:
        go_to_next_page()
    else:
        break
```

This pattern works well for websites with pagination, as it:
- Processes each page
- Checks for stopping conditions (like reaching a maximum page count)
- Tries to move to the next page, stopping if there isn't one

It's a robust approach that works with different pagination implementations.

## Saving Data to CSV

Once we've scraped the data, we need to save it in a usable format. CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a popular format because it's simple and compatible with many tools, including Excel and data analysis libraries.

```python
def save_to_csv(self, filename="quotes.csv"):
    """Save the scraped quotes to a CSV file."""
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        # Create a CSV writer
        fieldnames = ['text', 'author', 'tags']
        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        
        # Write the header
        writer.writeheader()
        
        # Write the data
        for quote in self.quotes_data:
            # Convert tags list to a string
            quote_to_write = quote.copy()
            quote_to_write['tags'] = ', '.join(quote_to_write['tags'])
            writer.writerow(quote_to_write)
    
    print(f"Data saved to {filename}")
```

### Understanding CSV Writing in Python

The `save_to_csv` method uses Python's built-in `csv` module. Let's break it down:

1. **Opening the file**:
   ```python
   with open(filename, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
   ```
   This line opens a file for writing (`'w'`) with UTF-8 encoding to support international characters. The `newline=''` parameter ensures consistent line endings across different operating systems.

2. **Creating a CSV writer**:
   ```python
   fieldnames = ['text', 'author', 'tags']
   writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
   ```
   We use `DictWriter` because our data is in dictionary format. The `fieldnames` list specifies which fields to include and in what order.

3. **Writing the header**:
   ```python
   writer.writeheader()
   ```
   This writes a header row with the field names.

4. **Writing the data**:
   ```python
   for quote in self.quotes_data:
       # Convert tags list to a string
       quote_to_write = quote.copy()
       quote_to_write['tags'] = ', '.join(quote_to_write['tags'])
       writer.writerow(quote_to_write)
   ```
   For each quote, we create a copy of the dictionary, convert the tags list to a comma-separated string, and write it as a row in the CSV file.

### Handling Different Data Types

In our example, we needed to convert the tags list to a string because CSV files store data as text. When working with different data types, you might need similar conversions:

- **Lists**: Convert to a delimiter-separated string (e.g., `', '.join(my_list)`)
- **Dictionaries**: Convert to a string representation or JSON
- **Dates and times**: Format to a standard format like ISO 8601
- **Boolean values**: Convert to 'True'/'False' or '1'/'0'

## Saving Data to JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is another popular format for storing structured data. It's especially useful when the data has a hierarchical or nested structure. Let's add a method to save our data as JSON:

```python
def save_to_json(self, filename="quotes.json"):
    """Save the scraped data to a JSON file."""
    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        json.dump(self.quotes_data, file, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
    print(f"Data saved to {filename}")
```

### Understanding JSON Writing in Python

The `save_to_json` method uses Python's built-in `json` module:

1. **Opening the file**:
   ```python
   with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
   ```
   Similar to CSV, we open a file for writing with UTF-8 encoding.

2. **Writing the data**:
   ```python
   json.dump(self.quotes_data, file, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
   ```
   This line serializes `self.quotes_data` to a JSON formatted string and writes it to the file. The `ensure_ascii=False` parameter allows non-ASCII characters, and `indent=4` makes the output pretty-printed with a 4-space indentation.

### Advantages of JSON over CSV

JSON has several advantages over CSV for certain use cases:

- **Preserves data types**: Numbers stay as numbers, booleans as booleans, etc.
- **Supports nested structures**: Objects within objects, lists within objects, etc.
- **No need for special handling of lists**: Lists are a native construct in JSON
- **Standardized format**: Widely used in web APIs and applications

For our quotes data, JSON can represent the tags as a native array instead of converting them to a string:

```json
{
    "text": "The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.",
    "author": "Albert Einstein",
    "tags": [
        "change",
        "deep-thoughts",
        "thinking",
        "world"
    ]
}
```

## Data Analysis with Pandas

Once we've scraped the data, we often want to analyze it. The pandas library is perfect for this task. Let's add a method to convert our data to a pandas DataFrame:

```python
def generate_pandas_dataframe(self):
    """Generate a pandas DataFrame from the quotes data."""
    # Convert the data to a format suitable for a DataFrame
    quotes_for_df = []
    for quote in self.quotes_data:
        quote_copy = quote.copy()
        quote_copy['tags'] = ', '.join(quote_copy['tags'])
        quotes_for_df.append(quote_copy)
    
    # Create the DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(quotes_for_df)
    return df
```

And a method to perform some basic analysis:

```python
def analyze_data(self):
    """Perform basic analysis on the scraped data."""
    if not self.quotes_data:
        print("No data to analyze.")
        return
    
    # Create a DataFrame for easier analysis
    df = self.generate_pandas_dataframe()
    
    # Count quotes by author
    author_counts = df['author'].value_counts()
    print("\n=== Quotes by Author ===")
    for author, count in author_counts.items():
        print(f"{author}: {count} quotes")
    
    # Analyze tags
    all_tags = []
    for tags_str in df['tags']:
        all_tags.extend([tag.strip() for tag in tags_str.split(',')])
    
    tag_counts = pd.Series(all_tags).value_counts()
    print("\n=== Most Common Tags ===")
    for tag, count in tag_counts.head(10).items():
        print(f"{tag}: {count} occurrences")
    
    # Quote length analysis
    df['quote_length'] = df['text'].apply(len)
    avg_length = df['quote_length'].mean()
    min_length = df['quote_length'].min()
    max_length = df['quote_length'].max()
    
    print("\n=== Quote Length Statistics ===")
    print(f"Average quote length: {avg_length:.2f} characters")
    print(f"Shortest quote: {min_length} characters")
    print(f"Longest quote: {max_length} characters")
```

### Understanding Data Analysis with Pandas

This method performs several types of analysis:

1. **Counting quotes by author**:
   ```python
   author_counts = df['author'].value_counts()
   ```
   This counts how many quotes each author has in our dataset.

2. **Analyzing tags**:
   ```python
   all_tags = []
   for tags_str in df['tags']:
       all_tags.extend([tag.strip() for tag in tags_str.split(',')])
   
   tag_counts = pd.Series(all_tags).value_counts()
   ```
   This extracts all tags from the comma-separated strings, then counts how often each tag appears.

3. **Analyzing quote length**:
   ```python
   df['quote_length'] = df['text'].apply(len)
   avg_length = df['quote_length'].mean()
   min_length = df['quote_length'].min()
   max_length = df['quote_length'].max()
   ```
   This calculates the length of each quote, then computes statistics like the average, minimum, and maximum lengths.

### Example Analysis Output

The analysis might produce output like:

```
=== Quotes by Author ===
Albert Einstein: 3 quotes
J.K. Rowling: 2 quotes
Jane Austen: 2 quotes
...

=== Most Common Tags ===
inspirational: 8 occurrences
life: 5 occurrences
humor: 4 occurrences
...

=== Quote Length Statistics ===
Average quote length: 95.6 characters
Shortest quote: 21 characters
Longest quote: 156 characters
```

This type of analysis provides insights into the data that might not be immediately obvious from looking at individual quotes.

## Running the Scraper

Now, let's put everything together and run the scraper:

```python
def main():
    """Run the quote scraper."""
    scraper = QuoteScraper()
    
    try:
        scraper.prepare_environment()
        scraper.scrape_all_pages(max_pages=3)  # Limit to 3 pages for this example
        scraper.save_to_csv()
    finally:
        scraper.terminate_webdriver()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This main function:
1. Creates an instance of our `QuoteScraper` class
2. Prepares the environment (initializes the WebDriver)
3. Scrapes quotes from up to 3 pages
4. Saves the data to a CSV file
5. Ensures the WebDriver is terminated, even if an error occurs

The `try/finally` block is particularly important as it ensures we always clean up our resources (the WebDriver) regardless of whether the scraping succeeds or fails. This is a good practice to prevent browser processes from hanging around after the script finishes.

## Advanced Features

Now that we have a basic scraper working, let's explore some advanced features that can make our scraper more powerful and versatile.

### Filter Quotes by Author

You might want to find all quotes by a specific author. We can add a method to filter the scraped quotes:

```python
def filter_quotes_by_author(self, author_name):
    """Filter and return quotes by a specific author."""
    return [quote for quote in self.quotes_data if quote['author'].lower() == author_name.lower()]
```

This method uses a list comprehension to filter the quotes, comparing the author names in a case-insensitive manner.

### Filter Quotes by Tag

Similarly, we might want to find all quotes with a specific tag:

```python
def filter_quotes_by_tag(self, tag_name):
    """Filter and return quotes with a specific tag."""
    return [quote for quote in self.quotes_data if tag_name.lower() in [t.lower() for t in quote['tags']]]
```

This method is a bit more complex because each quote has multiple tags, so we need to check if the tag name is in the list of tags for each quote.

### Extract Additional Information

The quotes website also has pages with detailed information about each author. Let's add a method to scrape these details:

```python
def get_author_info(self, author_url):
    """
    Navigate to an author's page and extract their information.
    
    Args:
        author_url: URL to the author's page
    
    Returns:
        Dict containing author's information
    """
    # Save the current URL to come back later
    current_url = self.driver.current_url
    
    # Navigate to the author's page
    self.driver.get(author_url)
    
    # Wait for the author information to load
    WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "author-details"))
    )
    
    # Extract information
    author_name = self.driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "author-title").text
    born_date = self.driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "author-born-date").text
    born_location = self.driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "author-born-location").text
    description = self.driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "author-description").text
    
    # Navigate back to the original page
    self.driver.get(current_url)
    
    return {
        'name': author_name,
        'born_date': born_date,
        'born_location': born_location,
        'description': description
    }
```

This method:
1. Saves the current URL
2. Navigates to the author's page
3. Extracts the author's information
4. Navigates back to the original page
5. Returns the extracted information as a dictionary

Now we can add a method to collect information for all authors:

```python
def collect_all_author_info(self):
    """Collect detailed information for all authors."""
    # Get unique authors and their URLs
    unique_authors = {}
    for quote in self.quotes_data:
        if quote['author'] not in unique_authors:
            unique_authors[quote['author']] = quote['author_url']
    
    # Collect details for each author
    print(f"Collecting information for {len(unique_authors)} authors...")
    for author_name, author_url in unique_authors.items():
        print(f"Getting info for {author_name}...")
        self.authors_data[author_name] = self.get_author_info(author_url)
    
    print(f"Collected information for {len(self.authors_data)} authors.")
```

This method:
1. Creates a dictionary of unique authors and their URLs
2. Iterates through the authors and calls `get_author_info` for each one
3. Stores the results in the `authors_data` dictionary

### Handling the Login Page

While quotes.toscrape.com doesn't require login for most features, it does have a login page that we can use to demonstrate how to handle authentication:

```python
def login_to_site(self, username, password):
    """
    Login to the quotes.toscrape.com website.
    
    Args:
        username: Username to use
        password: Password to use
    
    Returns:
        Boolean indicating success or failure
    """
    # Navigate to the login page
    self.driver.get("https://quotes.toscrape.com/login")
    
    # Wait for the login form to load
    WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "username"))
    )
    
    # Enter username and password
    username_field = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "username")
    password_field = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "password")
    
    username_field.send_keys(username)
    password_field.send_keys(password)
    
    # Submit the form
    password_field.submit()
    
    # Check if login was successful (look for the logout link)
    try:
        WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.LINK_TEXT, "Logout"))
        )
        return True
    except:
        return False
```

This method:
1. Navigates to the login page
2. Waits for the login form to load
3. Enters the username and password
4. Submits the form
5. Checks if the login was successful by looking for the "Logout" link

### Handling AJAX and Dynamic Content

Modern websites often load content dynamically using AJAX. While quotes.toscrape.com doesn't use AJAX, it's worth understanding how to handle it:

For AJAX-loaded content, you'll need to:

1. Wait for the content to load after an action (like clicking a button)
2. Sometimes interact with "Load More" buttons to reveal additional content
3. Possibly deal with infinite scrolling

Here's an example of how you might handle a "Load More" button:

```python
def handle_load_more_button(self):
    """Click the 'Load More' button repeatedly until all content is loaded."""
    while True:
        try:
            # Find the 'Load More' button
            load_more_button = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 5).until(
                EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "load-more-button"))
            )
            
            # Click the button
            load_more_button.click()
            
            # Wait for new content to load
            time.sleep(2)
            
        except:
            # If the button is not found or not clickable, we're done
            print("No more content to load or button not found.")
            break
```

And for infinite scrolling:

```python
def scroll_to_bottom(self, scroll_pause_time=1.0, max_scrolls=None):
    """Simulate scrolling to the bottom of the page to load all content."""
    scrolls = 0
    
    # Get initial scroll height
    last_height = self.driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
    
    while True:
        # Check if we've reached the maximum number of scrolls
        if max_scrolls and scrolls >= max_scrolls:
            print(f"Reached maximum scrolls ({max_scrolls}). Stopping.")
            break
        
        # Scroll down to the bottom
        self.driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")
        
        # Wait for new content to load
        time.sleep(scroll_pause_time)
        
        # Calculate new scroll height and compare with last scroll height
        new_height = self.driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
        
        # If heights are the same, we've reached the bottom
        if new_height == last_height:
            break
        
        last_height = new_height
        scrolls += 1
```

## Selenium Best Practices

When working with Selenium, following these best practices can make your scraper more robust and efficient:

### 1. Use Explicit Waits Instead of Implicit Waits

Explicit waits are more flexible and precise:

```python
# Good: Explicit wait
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "my-element"))
)

# Avoid: Implicit wait
driver.implicitly_wait(10)
```

### 2. Use CSS Selectors or XPath for Complex Selection

For complex element selection, CSS selectors or XPath are more powerful than basic locators:

```python
# Good: CSS selector
element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.quote span.text")

# Good: XPath
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@class='quote']/span[@class='text']")
```

### 3. Handle Exceptions Gracefully

Always handle potential exceptions to make your scraper robust:

```python
try:
    element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "my-element")
    # Process element
except NoSuchElementException:
    # Handle missing element
except TimeoutException:
    # Handle timeout
except Exception as e:
    # Handle other exceptions
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### 4. Clean Up Resources

Always clean up resources (like the WebDriver) when you're done:

```python
try:
    # Do scraping
finally:
    driver.quit()
```

### 5. Add Delays Between Requests

To be polite and avoid being blocked, add delays between requests:

```python
import time

# Add a random delay between 1 and 3 seconds
import random
time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))
```

### 6. Rotate User Agents

Some websites block or behave differently based on the user agent. Rotating user agents can help:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

options = Options()
options.add_argument("user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36")
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
```

### 7. Use Headless Mode for Production

For production, you can run Selenium in headless mode (without a visible browser window):

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

options = Options()
options.add_argument("--headless")
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
```

### 8. Save Screenshots for Debugging

Taking screenshots can help you debug issues:

```python
driver.save_screenshot("debug.png")
```

## Error Handling and Debugging

Web scraping can be fragile because websites change, network issues occur, and unexpected content appears. Good error handling makes your scraper more robust.

### Common Exceptions

Here are some common exceptions you might encounter with Selenium:

1. **NoSuchElementException**: Thrown when an element is not found
2. **TimeoutException**: Thrown when an explicit wait times out
3. **StaleElementReferenceException**: Thrown when an element is no longer attached to the DOM
4. **ElementNotInteractableException**: Thrown when an element is present but not interactable
5. **WebDriverException**: Base class for all WebDriver exceptions

### Debugging Techniques

Here are some techniques for debugging Selenium scrapers:

#### 1. Use Print Statements

Simple but effective. Add print statements to track the flow of your program:

```python
print(f"Found {len(quote_elements)} quote elements")
```

#### 2. Take Screenshots

Capture screenshots at key points to see what the browser is seeing:

```python
driver.save_screenshot(f"page_{page_num}.png")
```

#### 3. Use Try-Except with Detailed Error Reporting

Catch exceptions and print detailed information:

```python
try:
    element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "non-existent")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error type: {type(e).__name__}")
    print(f"Error message: {str(e)}")
    print(f"Current URL: {driver.current_url}")
    driver.save_screenshot("error.png")
```

#### 4. Print the HTML Source

Sometimes it's helpful to see the HTML source:

```python
print(driver.page_source)
```

#### 5. Use Selenium's Built-in Logging

Enable Selenium's logging for more detailed information:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Handling Different Types of Errors

Let's look at how to handle some common scraping scenarios:

#### 1. Element Not Found

```python
def safe_find_element(self, by, value, timeout=10):
    """Safely find an element, returning None if not found."""
    try:
        return WebDriverWait(self.driver, timeout).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((by, value))
        )
    except (NoSuchElementException, TimeoutException):
        print(f"Element not found: {by}={value}")
        return None
```

#### 2. Stale Element Reference

When elements become stale (detached from DOM), you need to re-find them:

```python
def click_with_retry(self, by, value, max_attempts=3):
    """Click an element with retry logic for stale elements."""
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            element = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
                EC.element_to_be_clickable((by, value))
            )
            element.click()
            return True
        except StaleElementReferenceException:
            if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                print(f"Stale element, retrying... (attempt {attempt+1})")
            else:
                print(f"Element still stale after {max_attempts} attempts.")
                return False
```

#### 3. Network Errors

For network errors, it can be helpful to retry the entire operation:

```python
def navigate_with_retry(self, url, max_attempts=3):
    """Navigate to a URL with retry logic for network errors."""
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            self.driver.get(url)
            WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
                lambda d: d.execute_script("return document.readyState") == "complete"
            )
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                print(f"Error navigating to {url}: {e}. Retrying... (attempt {attempt+1})")
                time.sleep(2)  # Wait before retrying
            else:
                print(f"Failed to navigate to {url} after {max_attempts} attempts.")
                return False
```

## Ethical Considerations in Web Scraping

Web scraping is a powerful technique, but it must be used responsibly. Here are some ethical considerations:

### 1. Respect Robots.txt

The `robots.txt` file specifies which parts of a website can be crawled by robots. Though it's not legally binding, respecting it is considered good etiquette:

```python
def check_robots_txt(self, url):
    """Check if scraping is allowed by robots.txt."""
    from urllib.robotparser import RobotFileParser
    
    rp = RobotFileParser()
    rp.set_url(f"{url}/robots.txt")
    rp.read()
    
    # Check if our user agent is allowed to access the URL
    return rp.can_fetch("*", url)
```

### 2. Rate Limiting

To avoid overloading the server, implement rate limiting:

```python
def rate_limited_get(self, url, min_interval=2.0):
    """Navigate to a URL with rate limiting."""
    current_time = time.time()
    elapsed = current_time - getattr(self, 'last_request_time', 0)
    
    # If we've made a request recently, wait
    if elapsed < min_interval:
        sleep_time = min_interval - elapsed
        print(f"Rate limiting: Sleeping for {sleep_time:.2f} seconds")
        time.sleep(sleep_time)
    
    # Navigate to the URL
    self.driver.get(url)
    
    # Update the last request time
    self.last_request_time = time.time()
```

### 3. Identify Your Scraper

It's good practice to identify your scraper by setting a custom user agent:

```python
def set_identifying_user_agent(self):
    """Set a user agent that identifies your scraper."""
    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    options.add_argument("user-agent=My Web Scraper (contact@example.com)")
    self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
```

### 4. Check Terms of Service

Always check a website's terms of service before scraping. Some websites explicitly prohibit scraping.

### 5. Use Public APIs When Available

If a website offers an API, it's usually better to use that instead of scraping.

### 6. Respect Copyright

Be aware that the content you scrape may be copyrighted. Make sure your use complies with copyright laws, which vary by country.

### 7. Minimize Server Load

Only request the pages you need, and avoid making too many requests in a short time:

```python
def scrape_all_pages(self, max_pages=None, delay_between_pages=2.0):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    while True:
        # ... existing code ...
        
        # Add a delay between pages
        time.sleep(delay_between_pages)
        
        # ... existing code ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### 1. StaleElementReferenceException

**Error**: `StaleElementReferenceException: Message: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document`

**Cause**: This occurs when the DOM element is no longer attached to the page, often after a page navigation or DOM update.

**Solution**: 
- Re-find the element after page navigation
- Use explicit waits to ensure the page is fully loaded
- Implement retry logic as shown in the error handling section

```python
def safe_interaction_with_retry(self, by, value, action, max_attempts=3):
    """Perform an action on an element with retry for stale elements."""
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            element = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
                EC.presence_of_element_located((by, value))
            )
            if action == "click":
                element.click()
            elif action == "text":
                return element.text
            # Add more actions as needed
            return True
        except StaleElementReferenceException:
            if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                print(f"Stale element, retrying... (attempt {attempt+1})")
            else:
                print(f"Element still stale after {max_attempts} attempts.")
                return False
```

#### 2. NoSuchElementException

**Error**: `NoSuchElementException: Message: no such element: Unable to locate element`

**Cause**: The element doesn't exist on the page, either because it hasn't loaded yet, the selector is incorrect, or the page structure has changed.

**Solution**:
- Check if your selector is correct
- Use explicit waits to ensure the page is fully loaded
- Print the page source to see what's actually there
- Take a screenshot to see what the browser is seeing

```python
def debug_element_not_found(self, by, value):
    """Debug an element that can't be found."""
    print(f"Element not found: {by}={value}")
    print("Current URL:", self.driver.current_url)
    print("Page title:", self.driver.title)
    
    # Save a screenshot
    self.driver.save_screenshot("debug_not_found.png")
    
    # Print part of the page source
    source = self.driver.page_source
    print("Page source excerpt:")
    print(source[:500] + "..." if len(source) > 500 else source)
```

#### 3. TimeoutException

**Error**: `TimeoutException: Message: timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer`

**Cause**: An explicit wait timed out because the expected condition wasn't met within the specified time.

**Solution**:
- Increase the timeout duration
- Check if your condition is correct
- Check if the page is loading correctly
- Check for network issues

```python
# Increase the timeout duration
WebDriverWait(self.driver, 20).until(  # Increased from 10 to 20 seconds
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "quote"))
)
```

#### 4. ElementClickInterceptedException

**Error**: `ElementClickInterceptedException: Message: element click intercepted`

**Cause**: The element is covered by another element (like a popup or overlay).

**Solution**:
- Use JavaScript to click the element
- Dismiss the overlaying element first
- Use a different element that's related to the one you want to click

```python
def click_with_javascript(self, element):
    """Click an element using JavaScript, bypassing overlays."""
    self.driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", element)
```

#### 5. InvalidSelectorException

**Error**: `InvalidSelectorException: Message: invalid selector`

**Cause**: The selector syntax is incorrect.

**Solution**:
- Check your selector syntax
- Try a different selector type (e.g., CSS instead of XPath)
- Use browser developer tools to verify your selector

```python
# Instead of this invalid XPath
# driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@class=quote]")  # Missing quotes around attribute value

# Use this correct XPath
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@class='quote']")
```

#### 6. WebDriverException: Chrome not reachable

**Error**: `WebDriverException: Message: chrome not reachable`

**Cause**: The Chrome browser process crashed or was terminated unexpectedly.

**Solution**:
- Create a new WebDriver instance
- Add error handling to catch and recover from browser crashes
- Use a more stable browser version

```python
def recover_from_browser_crash(self):
    """Recover from a browser crash by creating a new WebDriver."""
    try:
        self.driver.quit()
    except:
        pass  # Browser might already be closed
        
    print("Recovering from browser crash...")
    self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    self.driver.get(self.url)
```

### Debugging Tips

#### 1. Enable Verbose Logging

Enable detailed Selenium logs to see what's happening behind the scenes:

```python
import logging
from selenium.webdriver.remote.remote_connection import LOGGER

# Set the logger level
LOGGER.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

#### 2. Use a Debug Decorator

Create a decorator to log method calls and handle exceptions:

```python
def debug_method(func):
    """Decorator to log method calls and handle exceptions."""
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        try:
            result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
            print(f"{func.__name__} completed successfully")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in {func.__name__}: {type(e).__name__} - {str(e)}")
            self.driver.save_screenshot(f"error_{func.__name__}.png")
            raise
    return wrapper

# Usage:
@debug_method
def extract_quotes_from_page(self):
    # Method implementation
```

#### 3. Chrome DevTools Protocol

For advanced debugging, you can connect to Chrome DevTools Protocol:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

options = Options()
options.add_argument("--remote-debugging-port=9222")
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
```

Then open `chrome://inspect` in another Chrome window and connect to the debugging session.

#### 4. Conditional Breakpoints

Add conditional breakpoints in your code to pause execution when a problem occurs:

```python
def extract_quotes_from_page(self):
    # ... code ...
    
    quote_elements = self.driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "quote")
    
    if len(quote_elements) == 0:
        # This is like a breakpoint - it will raise an exception if no quotes are found
        # allowing you to inspect the state at this point
        raise Exception("No quote elements found - debugging pause")
        
    # ... rest of the code ...
```

#### 5. Use the Python Debugger

Insert the `pdb` debugger at strategic points:

```python
import pdb

def extract_quotes_from_page(self):
    # ... code ...
    
    quote_elements = self.driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "quote")
    
    if len(quote_elements) == 0:
        # Start the debugger
        pdb.set_trace()
        
    # ... rest of the code ...
```

Then, when the debugger activates, you can inspect variables, call methods, and step through the code.

### Fixing Specific Issues

#### Website Structure Changes

Websites change over time, which can break scrapers. To make your scraper more resilient:

1. **Use multiple selectors**: Try different ways to identify the same element
   ```python
   def find_with_fallbacks(self, selectors):
       """Try multiple selectors until one works."""
       for by, value in selectors:
           try:
               return self.driver.find_element(by, value)
           except NoSuchElementException:
               continue
       return None
       
   # Usage
   element = self.find_with_fallbacks([
       (By.ID, "quote-id"),
       (By.CLASS_NAME, "quote"),
       (By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div[itemtype='http://schema.org/CreativeWork']")
   ])
   ```

2. **Regular testing**: Run your scraper periodically to detect issues early

3. **Version your scrapers**: Keep old versions to compare behavior when issues arise

#### Handling Anti-Scraping Measures

Some websites implement measures to prevent scraping:

1. **Add delays**: Randomize the time between requests
   ```python
   import random
   time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 5))  # Random delay between 1 and 5 seconds
   ```

2. **Rotate user agents**: Use different user agent strings
   ```python
   user_agents = [
       "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36",
       "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.1 Safari/605.1.15",
       "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0"
   ]
   
   options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
   options.add_argument(f"user-agent={random.choice(user_agents)}")
   driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
   ```

3. **Use proxies**: Rotate IP addresses
   ```python
   options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
   options.add_argument(f"--proxy-server=http://your-proxy-address:port")
   driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
   ```

4. **Solve CAPTCHAs**: For sites with CAPTCHA protection, you might need services like 2Captcha or Anti-Captcha

#### Browser Compatibility Issues

If your scraper works inconsistently across environments:

1. **Specify browser version**: Lock to a specific browser version
   ```python
   from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
   
   driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager(version="91.0.4472.101").install())
   ```

2. **Use Docker**: Containerize your scraper to ensure consistent environment
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9
   
   # Install Chrome
   RUN wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add - \
       && echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list \
       && apt-get update \
       && apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable
   
   # Install Python dependencies
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Copy scraper code
   COPY . .
   
   CMD ["python", "quotes_scraper.py"]
   ```
