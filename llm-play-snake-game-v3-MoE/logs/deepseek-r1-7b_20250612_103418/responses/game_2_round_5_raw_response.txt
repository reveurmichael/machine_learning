========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to help this user with their Snake game problem. They've given me a specific scenario where the snake's head is at (3,4), moving right. The body cells are [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)], and the apple is at (6,1). My goal is to plan a safe path for the snake's head to reach the apple without colliding with walls or its own body.

First, I'll map out the current grid based on the given information. The head is at (3,4), which means it's in the middle-bottom part of the 10x10 grid. The body cells are behind and below the head, stretching from (2,6) up to (2,4). So, the snake currently looks something like this:

- Head: (3,4)
- Body1: (2,4)
- Body2: (2,5)
- Body3: (2,6)

The apple is at (6,1), which is way to the right and near the top-left corner. The snake needs to move towards the apple without getting stuck or colliding.

I should consider the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction immediately, so since it's moving RIGHT, its next move can't be LEFT. Also, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move left, so I need to ensure that when the snake eats the apple, it doesn't block itself completely.

The Manhattan distance from head to apple is 3 in x (from 3 to 6) and 3 in y (from 4 to 1). So, ideally, moving RIGHT three times and DOWN three times. But I need to visualize how the body will follow without colliding.

Looking at the current body positions, [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)], when the snake moves right, the head will go to (4,4). Then, the body segments shift forward: (3,4) becomes the new head, and each segment follows. But I need to check if any of these movements would cause a collision with walls or other parts of the body.

If I move RIGHT again from (4,4), the next head position is (5,4). Then, inserting the old head at the front: [ (4,4), ... ] and pushing others back. But wait, after moving right once, the snake's head would be at (4,4). The next move can't reverse to LEFT because it just moved RIGHT.

Wait, no—each move is a step in a direction. So first, from (3,4) to (4,4) when moving RIGHT. Then, for the next move, since it's already moved RIGHT once, it can't move LEFT this time. It could move RIGHT again or choose another direction like UP or DOWN.

But moving directly towards the apple is still the best bet because that will cover Manhattan distance faster and leave room to maneuver if needed later. So from (3,4) → (4,4), then (5,4), etc., up to 6 in x, while adjusting y accordingly.

However, I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause the head to overlap with any body segments except when growing after eating the apple.

Looking at the current body positions [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)], moving RIGHT once would place the new head at (4,4). The existing bodies are from x=2 down to 6 in y. So (4,4) is empty; no collision yet.

Next move, can't go LEFT because just went RIGHT. So next possible moves could be RIGHT again or maybe DOWN or UP.

Moving right each time seems safest. Let's outline the path:

1. Move RIGHT: head to (4,4)
2. Next direction? Still RIGHT, but after this step, we might have space to turn if needed.
3. Continue moving RIGHT until x=6.
But wait, from (5,4), moving RIGHT would take us to (6,4). Then y is still 4, and the apple is at (6,1), which requires going down.

Wait, that's only part of the path. Let me think again.

The head needs to go from (3,4) → ... → (6,1). So moving RIGHT three times would get us to x=6 but still need to go DOWN 3 steps. But each movement must be planned carefully because the body segments will follow, and I don't want to collide with them.

Alternatively, perhaps a diagonal approach isn't possible since the snake can only move in four directions. So moving right three times and down three times is necessary, but we need to ensure that during these moves, the body doesn't block itself.

But given the current body positions [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)], if I move RIGHT once:

- New head: (4,4)
- Body becomes [(4,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]

Wait, no. The process is to insert the old head at the front of the body list and remove the tail unless it's eaten.

So after moving RIGHT once:

1. Old head: (3,4) → becomes new body1
2. Current body is [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ]
3. Insert old head at front: [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ]
4. Since no apple eaten, remove last element: tail becomes (2,5). So new body is [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]

Now the snake's position is [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should re-examine how the body shifts.

The correct process is:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check for collision.
3. Update body by inserting old head at front and removing last element unless apple eaten.
4. Set new_head as current head.

So initial state:
Head: (3,4)
Body: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]

Move RIGHT:

1. new_head = (4,4)
2. Check collision: is (4,4) in body? Body is [ (2,4), ... ] so no collision.
3. Insert old head at front of body:
   new_body = [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) ]
4. Since not eating apple, remove last element: tail becomes (2,5)
   So updated body is [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ]

Now the snake's head is at (4,4), and the body follows.

Next move options:

- Can't go LEFT because just went RIGHT.
- Possible moves: RIGHT again or DOWN/UP.

If I move RIGHT again from (4,4):

1. new_head = (5,4)
2. Check collision: not in current body [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ]
3. Insert old head at front:
   new_body = [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ]
4. Remove last element because no apple eaten: tail is now (2,4)
   So body becomes [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]

Now the snake's head is at (5,4). Next move can't be LEFT.

If I continue moving RIGHT:

1. new_head = (6,4)
2. Check collision: not in body [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]
3. Insert old head:
   new_body = [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]
4. Remove tail: now body is [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]

Now the snake's head is at (6,4). But we need to get down to y=1.

Next move can't be LEFT or RIGHT since it just moved RIGHT again? Wait no—last direction was RIGHT, so next move cannot be LEFT. So possible directions: UP or DOWN.

Wait, movement rules say you cannot reverse direction on the first move if current is RIGHT, but after that, maybe it's allowed unless it's an immediate reversal?

No, rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": if current direction is RIGHT, you may not choose LEFT next; similarly for other directions. So moving from RIGHT to RIGHT again is okay.

But now at (6,4), the body is [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]. Next move options:

If I try to go DOWN: new_head = (6,5). But apple is at (6,1), so it's moving away. Maybe better to move left?

Wait no, because current direction was RIGHT, and you can't choose LEFT now unless allowed.

No, rule 2 says "Cannot reverse": if current direction is RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT; similarly for other directions.

So after a sequence of RIGHT moves, the snake can't make a LEFT turn until it's not necessary. So to get down from (6,4) to (6,1), perhaps moving DOWN three times would work.

But need to see if that's possible without collision.

Let me simulate:

Current position: head at (6,4). Body is [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]

Move DOWN once:

new_head = (6,5)
Insert old head (6,4) at front:
new_body = [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ]
No apple eaten; remove tail: body becomes [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Now snake's position is head at (6,5). Next move can't be UP because it just went DOWN. So possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT.

But current direction was DOWN, so next cannot reverse to UP; but the rule says you can't reverse direction on any step if previous was same? Wait no—it's more about not reversing immediately after a certain direction.

Wait, rule 2 is "Cannot reverse": meaning that once moving in a direction, you can't go back. So from RIGHT, next can't be LEFT; from LEFT, next can't be RIGHT; but directions like UP and DOWN don't restrict each other? Or do they?

This needs clarification.

Looking at the rules again: rule 2 says "you cannot reverse the direction of movement except if it's your first move". So perhaps after moving RIGHT, you can't move LEFT immediately unless it's a different axis. Wait no—it just says that when moving in a certain direction, you cannot reverse to the opposite on that axis.

Wait maybe not: the exact wording is "you cannot reverse the direction of movement except if it's your first move." So for example, if you're moving RIGHT, you can't go LEFT next; but you could still move UP or DOWN as needed. Similarly, after moving LEFT, you can't move RIGHT next.

So from (6,5), since last moved was DOWN, the next move can be any except LEFT? Wait no—last direction was DOWN, which is a different axis. So perhaps it's allowed to move in other directions again.

Wait I think rule 2 says that if current movement is RIGHT, you cannot choose LEFT as your next move; but for other movements like UP or DOWN, their reverses (DOWN and UP) might be allowed unless they are same direction?

No, let me read the exact wording:

"you cannot reverse the direction of movement except if it's your first move."

So perhaps moving from RIGHT to LEFT is a reversal on the same axis. But moving from RIGHT to UP or DOWN isn't a reversal.

Therefore, after moving RIGHT once (from (3,4) → (4,4)), next can't go LEFT but can go any other direction including RIGHT again.

Similarly, if you move RIGHT twice in a row, that's allowed because it's the same axis; only immediate reversals on the same axis are prohibited.

So back to simulation:

Current head: (6,5). Body is [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Possible next moves without reversing on RIGHT:

- RIGHT again? But x=6+1=7 would be beyond current body; but perhaps that's possible.

But wait, if I move RIGHT from (6,5):

new_head = (7,5)
Insert old head at front:
new_body = [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]
No apple eaten; remove tail: body becomes [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ]

But now the snake's head is at (7,5). Next move can't be LEFT.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP or DOWN could help get closer to the apple without extending too far.

From (6,5), if I move DOWN:

new_head = (6,6)
Insert old head:
new_body = [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]
Since not eating apple, remove tail: body becomes [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ]

Wait, but then moving DOWN from y=5 to 6 is going away from the apple at y=1. That's counterproductive.

Alternatively, if I move LEFT once:

new_head = (5,5)
Insert old head:
new_body = [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]
Remove tail: body is now [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ]

Now the snake's head is at (5,5). Next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait this seems like a dead end. The apple is too far down, and moving up from current y=5 would require going back towards 1, but how?

Alternatively, maybe after some initial moves to the right, I should start moving DOWN earlier.

But let me think about an alternative path.

Instead of moving all the way to x=6 first, perhaps move diagonally? But no—snake can only move in four directions each step, not diagonally.

Wait another approach: from (3,4), maybe go LEFT once, but that would be against rule 2 since current movement is RIGHT. So I can't do that unless it's my first move after a different direction.

But perhaps going DOWN before moving too far to the right could allow better positioning for getting down later.

Wait no—head is at (3,4), and body cells are behind and below. Moving LEFT isn't allowed now because last moved was RIGHT.

So initial moves must be either RIGHT or another non-reversing direction like UP or DOWN?

But moving UP from y=4 would take us to y=5; but apple is at y=1, which is much lower. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let's try a different strategy: instead of going all the way right first, perhaps move in a serpentine pattern.

From (3,4):

1. Move RIGHT → (4,4)
2. Then move DOWN → (4,5)
Wait no—head was at (4,4), moving RIGHT again would take to (5,4). But I thought about that earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps from (3,4)→(4,4), then next move can be UP or DOWN. Let's try:

Move RIGHT: head → (4,4)
Next move can't be LEFT; so possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

If we choose to move DOWN:

new_head = (4,5)
Insert old head at front:
body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ] after step 1
Wait no—step by step again.

Initial state: head is (3,4); body is [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]

Move RIGHT to (4,4):

- new_body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ] after removing tail

So now snake's position is:

Head: (4,4)
Body: [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ]

Next move can be RIGHT again or DOWN/UP.

If I choose to move UP from y=4→y=3?

new_head = (4,3)
Check collision with current body [(3,4), ... ] no collision.
Insert old head at front:
new_body becomes [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ]
Remove tail: new body is [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]

Now snake's head is at (4,3). Next move can't be RIGHT because just moved RIGHT again?

Wait no—if the last movement was RIGHT, next can only not be LEFT; other directions are allowed. So from (4,3), I could move UP to y=2.

new_head = (4,2)
Insert old head:
body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) ]
Remove tail: body is now [ (4,3), (4,4) ]

Wait but the apple is at (6,1). So moving down from y=3→y=2, etc., would bring us closer.

But also, our x position is 4. To reach x=6, we need to move right twice more.

So maybe a plan:

From (4,3), next moves: RIGHT, then RIGHT again, then DOWN thrice.

Wait let's simulate:

1. Move from (4,3) → RIGHT → (5,3)
2. Check collision with current body [ (4,3), ... ]? No.
   Insert old head at front:
   new_body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) ]
   Remove tail: body is [ (4,3), (4,4) ]

Wait no—actually:

After moving RIGHT from (4,3):

new_head = (5,3)
Insert old head at front:
body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), ... ] Wait initial body after previous step was [(4,4), (3,4)]. So inserting (5,3) would be:

Wait no—this is getting confusing. Let me use the correct process.

Each time:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check collision with current body except apple eaten position.
3. Insert old head at front of body and remove last element unless eating apple.
4. Set new_head as head for next step.

So let's reconstruct from (4,3):

Current snake: [(4,3), (3,4), (2,5)]
Wait no—earlier steps got messy. Maybe a better approach is to use code-like pseudocode:

snake = [head, body1, body2, ... ]
apple_pos

while not at apple:
    for direction in possible_directions where can_move_without_reversing:
        move_step()
        if reached apple: break
        check collision with snake's body except head
        reset step and try next direction
    else:
        # stuck, need to find another path

But without coding, maybe a better way is to think of the minimal steps required.

The snake needs to go from (3,4) to (6,1). It can move RIGHT twice to get to x=5, then RIGHT again? No, because body blocks would interfere. Alternatively, perhaps alternate directions.

Wait another thought: in some games like Snake, you have to manage the growing tail and avoiding self-collision. So maybe the minimal path is not straightforward.

But given that this is a problem with specific starting positions and apple location, I need to find the exact movement sequence.

Alternatively, maybe visualize the grid:

Current snake head at (3,4). Body behind is [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]. Apple at (6,1).

Visualizing:

Row y=4: snake head at x=3
Rows below:
y=5 and above have body on left.

Apple is far to the right and down.

So possible moves from head are RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN. But LEFT isn't allowed since we were moving RIGHT last time? Wait no—if starting position is (3,4), first move can be any direction except reversing previous if it was a same axis reverse.

Wait actually, initial movement has no previous except default—so for the first step from head at (3,4), possible directions are right, left, up, down—all allowed because there's no previous move. So maybe start moving DOWN or LEFT initially.

But perhaps starting with RIGHT is better to get closer in x direction.

So plan:

1. Move RIGHT → (4,4)
2. Next can't move LEFT.
   - Options: RIGHT again, UP, or DOWN.

Let's try moving RIGHT twice first.

From (3,4)→(4,4): as before
Then from (4,4), next move can be RIGHT to (5,4)

But then need to get further right. Alternatively, after two Right moves:

1. Move RIGHT: (4,4)
2. Move RIGHT again: (5,4)
Now snake's body is [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5)] → no, wait.

Wait step by step for first two moves:

Move 1:
head from (3,4) to (4,4). Body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) ]

Move 2: can't move LEFT. So options: RIGHT, UP, DOWN.
If we move RIGHT again:
new_head = (5,4)
insert old head at front:
body becomes [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), ... ] but original body was [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]
Wait no—each move:

After Move 1: new body is [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]
Move 2: moving RIGHT → (5,4)
Insert old head at front:
new_body = [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ] after removing tail

So now snake's position:

Head at (5,4), body is [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]

Now Move 3: can't move LEFT. So options: RIGHT again would take to x=6.

Check collision with body? Body has (4,4) and others—so moving RIGHT to (6,4):

new_head = (6,4)
Insert old head at front:
body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ] after removing tail

Now snake's position: head at (6,4), body is [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]

Move 4: can't move LEFT. So options: RIGHT again would be beyond x=6? No—snake moves in same grid. Alternatively, move DOWN.

Move DOWN to y=3:

new_head = (6,3)
Insert old head:
body becomes [ (5,4), (6,4), ... ] Wait let me do it step by step.

Current snake after Move 3: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]

Move 4: move DOWN → y=3

new_head = (6,3)
insert old head at front:
body becomes [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ] after removing tail

Wait no:

After inserting new_head (6,3) at front, the body is now [(6,3), (5,4), (4,4)]

Then remove last element if not eating apple. Since we didn't eat apple yet.

So snake's position: head at (6,3), body is [ (5,4), (4,4) ]

Now from here:

Move 5: can't move LEFT, same as before. So options: RIGHT again would be x=7 which may not exist, or other directions.

Alternatively, move UP to y=2?

new_head = (6,2)
Check collision with body? Body is [(5,4), (4,4)], so no collision.
Insert old head at front:
body becomes [ (6,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Wait wait: current snake after Move 4:

head was moved to (6,3)
so when moving up from y=3→2, the new_head is (6,2)

Then insert old head which was at (6,3) → no, wait.

No—each step is:

From position x,y:
1. compute new_head
2. check collision with body except apple's pos.
3. if not colliding, update snake by inserting new_head at front and removing last element unless ate apple.

So after Move 4: head at (6,3), body was [ (5,4), (4,4) ]

Now in Move 5:

Trying to move DOWN from y=3→y=2 is actually moving UP? Or maybe confusion between coordinate system—assuming y increases downwards or upwards. Typically, in grid systems, higher y is down.

So if apple is at (6,1), which has lower y than head's current position of 3, so to reach it, the snake needs to move DOWN from current position.

Wait I think my previous assumption was wrong—if the coordinate system is such that y increases as you go up, then moving UP would decrease y. So apple at (6,1) has higher x and lower y than head's initial position of 3,4? Wait in any case, it depends on how grid coordinates are defined.

But perhaps to make progress: Let's assume the coordinate system is standard where higher y means going down.

So current head is at (6,3). To get to apple at (6,1), need to move DOWN twice.

Let me check if that works without collision.

Move 5: from (6,3) → DOWN to (6,2)
Check for collision with body [(5,4), (4,4)]: no.
Insert old head (6,3) at front:
body becomes [ (6,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Then remove tail: body is now [ (6,3), (5,4) ]

Move 6: from (6,2) → DOWN to (6,1)
Check for collision with current body [(6,3), ... ]? Wait no—body after Move 5 was [ (6,3), (5,4) ], so moving to y=1 won't collide.

Wait but apple is at (6,1). So does this cause a collision?

If we move from (6,2)→(6,1):

Check if the new_head would be overlapping with any part of body except head. Current body after Move 5: [ (6,3), (5,4) ]

So moving to (6,1): is that on any of these? No.

But wait—the body was at y=3 and 4 before—so moving down two steps from y=2 would reach the apple.

Wait no—if you are at (6,2), moving DOWN once takes you to (6,1)—which is where the apple is. So that's a collision?

No because the apple is at (6,1). Wait wait—the condition for eating apple is when new_head == apple_pos. So in this case, yes—if I move from (6,2)→(6,1), and if apple is there, it would be eaten.

But according to the rules: "when you reach a position with an apple." So assuming that (6,1) has an apple, moving down from (6,2) to (6,1) would cause collision? Or perhaps not—it's just movement towards the apple. Wait no—apple is considered as part of the snake's body once eaten.

Wait actually, when you move into the apple's position, that makes you eat it, so your head moves there and then grows? Or does moving to a cell with an apple cause you to grow?

Actually, in Snake-like games, eating the apple (or food) causes the snake to grow—usually by adding a new body segment at the front. But for this problem, perhaps when moving into apple's position, it's considered as reaching.

But in any case, if we have:

Move 5: head is at (6,3), body is [ (6,2) ] after step?

Wait I'm getting confused because of multiple steps and how the snake's body updates each move. Maybe need a better approach—listing out each step with current positions.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path that doesn't require going all the way to x=5 then 6 and so on.

Maybe another initial direction could lead to a quicker route.

Alternative plan:

From (3,4), instead of moving RIGHT twice first, move DOWN initially.

Move 1: from (3,4)→DOWN to (3,3)
Then check for collision—body is empty. Eat apple if possible.
Current position after Move 1: head at (3,3)

But apple is still at (6,1)—need further steps.

Move 2: can move any direction except LEFT? Wait initial movement was DOWN, so next step can be RIGHT, LEFT, or UP.

Let's say we go RIGHT:

new_head = (4,3)
Check for collision with current body—none.
Insert head at front:
body becomes [ (3,3), ... ]?

Wait no: starting from (3,4)→DOWN to (3,3). So first move was DOWN.

Second move is RIGHT to (4,3):

new_head = (4,3)
old_head is now (3,3)

So insert new_head at front:
snake becomes [ (4,3), (3,3) ]
But wait, no—the body after Move 1 was empty except head. So when moving from (3,4) to (3,3):

After step, snake's body is [ (3,3), ... ]?

Wait initial state: snake is just head at (3,4). After first move DOWN:

new_head = (3,3)
body becomes [ (3,3) ]

But since it's the initial step, I think after moving, the new head is followed by an empty tail? Or does it add to a body?

Wait maybe more accurately: snake's position is represented as a list where first element is current head and subsequent are body segments. So starting with just [ (3,4) ]

After Move 1: DOWN → (3,3). Body becomes [ (3,3), ... ]? Or does it add the new head to front?

Wait no—each move adds the new head at front.

So initial snake is [(3,4)]

Move 1: DOWN→(3,3)

Snake becomes [ (3,3) ]

But since there's only one segment, no body. So next move can be any direction except previous if same axis reverse.

Wait but for first step, the movement doesn't have a prior—it was initial.

So Move 2: from (3,3), options:

Can go RIGHT to (4,3)
Can go LEFT back to (2,3) which would create collision with self
Or UP to (3,2)

But UP is moving towards higher y if y increases downward. So maybe going DOWN again.

Wait no—if current position is (3,3), and apple at (6,1)—so need to move down? Or wait—no—the snake's head is at (3,4) initially, which has higher x than the apple's 6; but if we go left from there, it might reach.

Wait this approach may not be working. Maybe initial right movement was better.

Alternatively, perhaps a spiral pattern would help—moving RIGHT as much as possible to increase x, then DOWN when necessary, and so on.

But without getting stuck in the weeds, maybe try another path:

1. (3,4) → RIGHT→(4,4)
2. (4,4) → RIGHT→(5,4)
3. (5,4) → RIGHT→ can't go beyond x=6? Or perhaps it's allowed.
Wait grid size isn't specified—assume it's large enough.

But moving to (6,4). Now apple is at (6,1), so need to move DOWN from here.

So step 3: (5,4) → RIGHT→(6,4)

Now step 4: (6,4) → DOWN→(6,3)
Step 5: (6,3) → DOWN→(6,2)
Step 6: (6,2) → DOWN→(6,1)—apple!

So total steps:

From (3,4):

1. RIGHT to (4,4)

2. RIGHT to (5,4)

3. RIGHT to (6,4)

4. DOWN to (6,3)

5. DOWN to (6,2)

6. DOWN to (6,1)

Wait but moving from step 2→3: the body after step 2 is [(5,4), (4,4)]

In step 3: move RIGHT to (6,4). Check for collision with body—body was at x=5 and 4; so no collision.

Insert new_head (6,4) at front. Body becomes [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Then remove tail if not eaten apple—in step 3: head moves to 6,4; body is [(5,4), (4,4)]

In step 4: move DOWN from (6,4)→(6,3). Check for collision with current body—body at y=4. So no.

Insert new_head (6,3) at front: body becomes [ (6,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Step 5: move DOWN to (6,2): same logic; insert head→ [ (6,2), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Step 6: move DOWN to (6,1). Now check for collision with body.

Current body is [(6,2), ... ], so moving to (6,1)—which may be empty if that position isn't occupied by the body. But apple is at (6,1); so when you step there, it's a terminal point—so no need to worry about self-collision beyond previous steps.

Thus, this path seems feasible without collision.

So total steps: 5 movements after initial step? Wait no:

Wait moving from head position each time. So the number of moves is equal to the number of times you change direction or move forward.

From (3,4):

1. Move RIGHT→(4,4)

2. Move RIGHT→(5,4)

3. Move RIGHT→(6,4)

Now need to start moving DOWN:

4. Move DOWN→(6,3)

5. Move DOWN→(6,2)

6. Move DOWN→(6,1)—apple!

So total of 6 moves.

But wait in the initial steps, are there any self-collisions?

After step 3: body is [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]

Step 4: move DOWN to (6,3): current body after step 3 was [ (6,4), ... ]. So moving down to y=3 won't collide with the body at y=4.

Similarly steps are safe.

So yes, this path is feasible without collision and reaches apple in 6 moves.
</think>

The snake can move right twice to reach x=6, then three times downward towards y=1. This path ensures it doesn't self-collide as each subsequent move shifts further down or right from its current position.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Move RIGHT from (3,4) to (4,4).
2. Move RIGHT again to (5,4).
3. Move RIGHT once more to (6,4).
4. Move DOWN to (6,3).
5. Move DOWN to (6,2).
6. Move DOWN finally to (6,1), where the apple is located.

This sequence of six moves safely navigates the snake to the apple without self-colliding.
