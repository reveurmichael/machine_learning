{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP"], "reasoning": "To reach the apple located at position (9, 9) from the initial position (7, 7), follow these steps: Move Right to (8, 7). Then move Right again to (9, 7). Subsequently, move Up to (9, 8) and finally move Up once more to (9, 9). Each move changes direction only when necessary and avoids reversing directions, ensuring a collision-free path."}
