 {
    "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN"],
    "reasoning": "To reach the apple at (5,9) from the current position (5,5), we first move 'DOWN' twice as it has the smallest Manhattan distance to the apple. This ensures that the snake stays safe by not reversing direction and avoids hugging walls unnecessarily."
