<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (7,6) to the apple at (5,4). 

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (7,6), and the body follows as [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. So the snake is moving downward along column 6 from row 6 down to 2. 

The current direction is "RIGHT". Wait, no—the direction is given as "RIGHT", but looking at the body, it seems like the head is at (7,6) and the next segment is (6,6), which suggests that the snake was moving left before. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial state.

Wait, the head is at (7,6). The body list starts with (6,6), which would be to the left of the head. So if the current direction is "RIGHT", then perhaps this indicates a problem because the body is in front? Or maybe the direction is about the movement after this step.

Wait no—the direction is the current direction the snake is moving. So if the snake's body starts behind the head and goes to (6,6), that suggests the snake is currently moving left (from 7,6 to 6,6). But according to the input, the current direction is "RIGHT". That seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The body cells are [(6,6), (6,5), ...], which means after the head at (7,6), the next segment is (6,6)—so moving left. But the direction is given as "RIGHT", which would mean the head is moving right from (7,6) to (8,6). Hmm, that doesn't seem possible because then the body can't follow in front.

Wait a second, perhaps there's an error in my understanding. Let me think again: The body cells are ordered from the segment immediately behind the head. So if the head is at (7,6), and the first body cell is (6,6), that suggests the snake is moving left because the head is to the right of the body segment.

But the current direction is "RIGHT", which would imply that the next move should be towards the right. However, this might not align with the body's position unless there's a turn in the movement.

Wait no—the current direction could have changed after the last move. So perhaps the snake was moving left before, but now it's supposed to change direction to "RIGHT".

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to visualize the grid:

Head is at (7,6). Body cells are [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. So the snake is a vertical line from (7,6) down to (6,2). Wait no—because the body starts with (6,6), which is directly left of the head. Then the next segment is (6,5), which is below (6,6). So the snake's body is moving downward along x=6, from y=6 down to 2.

So the current direction must be "DOWN". But according to the input, it's "RIGHT", which is confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the movement just happened. For example, if the snake was previously moving right and now is changing direction. Or maybe the direction refers to the next intended move, not the current state of the body.

This is a bit tricky. Let me proceed with what I have.

The apple is at (5,4). So from the head's position (7,6), we need to reach (5,4). The x decreases by 2 and y decreases by 2, so we need to move left twice and down twice.

But considering that moving in a straight line would require the snake to change direction appropriately without colliding with its body.

Given that the current direction is "RIGHT", but the head is at (7,6) and the next segment is (6,6), perhaps the snake was moving left before, and now the intended move is to turn right—wait, no. If the snake is moving right from (7,6), it would go to (8,6), but that's outside the grid because x can only go up to 9, so maybe not an issue.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the direction. Let me try to proceed with planning a path regardless.

The head needs to move left twice and down twice. The shortest path would be two LEFTs and two DOWNs in some order—like LDD or DLL or DLDL, etc. But we need to ensure that each movement doesn't cause collision with the body and stays within bounds.

But looking at the current position of the snake: the body is along (6,6) down to (6,2). So if the head moves left from (7,6), it would go into (6,6), which is occupied by the first body segment. That's a collision unless that part of the body has moved.

Wait no—after moving, the body will shift. The rules state that when you move, the old head becomes the new BODY1, and then the tail may be removed or not depending on whether an apple was eaten.

So if I'm at (7,6) and choose to move LEFT, the new head would be (6,6). Then, we need to check for collisions. The body is [(6,6), ...], so in this case, after moving, the old head becomes part of the body. So the new head would be colliding with BODY1 before it's moved.

Thus, moving LEFT first is not possible because that would immediately cause a collision.

So I need to find another direction. Let's see:

Current direction is "RIGHT", so the next move cannot be "LEFT" as per rule 2 (cannot reverse). Wait no—the current direction is "RIGHT", which means you can't choose "LEFT". So from RIGHT, you can only choose UP or DOWN.

Wait, according to movement rules: You cannot reverse. If current direction is "UP", you can't choose "DOWN"; same for LEFT and RIGHT. So if the current direction is RIGHT, the next move cannot be LEFT; but can it be any other direction, including NONE?

Wait no—the current direction is given as "RIGHT". The movement rules say that you cannot reverse. So from "RIGHT", next move can't be "LEFT", but can be UP or DOWN.

So in this case, the first move must be either UP or DOWN.

Looking at the apple's position (5,4), which is to the left and down from the head (7,6). So moving directly down might help. Alternatively, moving up or down could change the path.

Wait, perhaps moving DOWN is better because it would take us closer to the apple in y-coordinate, but we need to decrease x as well.

But considering that moving in a straight line may be blocked by the body. Let me see:

If I choose DOWN first. New head would be (7,5). Then check for collision: the new head is not part of the body except possibly after movement.

Wait, the body before any move is [(6,6), (6,5), ...]. So after moving to (7,5), we need to check if this new position is in the current body. The new head would be at (7,5). Current body cells are [(6,6), (6,5), etc.] so (7,5) is not present, which is safe.

So moving DOWN first is possible.

Next move: Now, after moving to (7,5), the direction can change. Since the previous direction was RIGHT, and we moved DOWN, the next direction cannot be UP because that would reverse DOWN→UP.

Wait no—the previous movement was DOWN, so next direction cannot be UP. So from DOWN, you can't choose UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait no—directions are only "UP", "DOWN", etc., and you can't reverse.

So after moving DOWN, the new current direction is DOWN. Thus, next move cannot be UP.

Wait, no: The direction changes based on the chosen move. So if I'm currently moving RIGHT, and choose to move DOWN, then the new direction becomes DOWN for the next step.

So in this case:

Step 1: Direction is RIGHT, so possible moves are UP or DOWN (can't go LEFT).

I choose DOWN: head moves from (7,6) → (7,5). Safe because body is at [(6,6), ...].

Then, after moving, the body updates. The old head (7,6) becomes the new BODY1.

So body becomes [ (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) ].

Wait no—the body list is updated by inserting the old head at front and then possibly removing tail. Since in this case, we didn't eat an apple, the tail will be removed. So new body is [ (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) ] because the previous body was length 5, after moving it becomes 5 as well—wait no.

Wait, initial body list is [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] which has 5 elements. So when moving normally, the new head is added to front, and tail is removed if not eating apple.

So after moving to (7,5):

BODY becomes [ (6,6) ]? Wait no: Let me retrace.

Wait, initial state:

Head: (7,6)

Body: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]

After moving to (7,5):

New head is (7,5).

Old head (7,6) becomes the new BODY1.

Then, body list is [ (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) ]—but since we didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. So it's now [(7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)].

Wait no—the original body list was 5 elements. When moving, the old head becomes new BODY1, so adding one more element to front, making it 6. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, remove tail, ending up with 5 again: [(7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)].

Hmm, not sure about this part.

In any case, after moving down to (7,5), the next move can be either LEFT or RIGHT, but considering that current direction is now DOWN. So from DOWN, next direction cannot be UP. Wait no—the direction changes based on the chosen move. So if I was moving DOWN in step 1, then for step 2, possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT (can't go UP as it's reverse of DOWN).

Wait, but the rules say you can't reverse from your current direction. So if I'm currently moving DOWN, next move cannot be UP.

So after first move to (7,5), direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP; must choose LEFT or RIGHT.

Now, from (7,5), we need to decrease x towards 5. Let's try moving LEFT.

Move LEFT: new head at (6,5). Check for collision with current body after the move.

After moving, old head (7,5) becomes part of body. So the new head is at (6,5), which was previously in the body as [(7,6), (6,6), (6,5)...]. Wait, so (6,5) is already a body segment before the move.

Thus, moving LEFT would result in collision because the new head would be at (6,5), which is part of the current body. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving, the body shifts and the new position becomes okay? Let me think: After moving to (6,5), the body includes the old head (7,5) as new BODY1. But (6,5) was already a body cell before. Wait no—the original body was [(6,6), ...], so after inserting (7,6), it's [ (7,6), (6,6), (6,5)... ].

So when moving to (6,5), the new head is at (6,5). The current body before any move includes (6,5) as one of its cells. So this would cause a collision because the new head is entering a cell that's part of the body except for the last segment which will be removed.

Wait no—the body list after inserting old head becomes [ (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) ] and then tail is removed if not eating apple. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT from (7,5) to (6,5) would cause the new head to be at (6,5), which was part of the body before movement. So this is a collision because the body hasn't shifted yet. Therefore, moving LEFT in step 2 is not allowed.

So next possible move after DOWN is RIGHT.

Move RIGHT: from (7,5) → (8,5). Check for collision: The new head is at (8,5), which is not part of the current body except perhaps after movement. Since the body before moving doesn't include (8,5), it's safe.

So step 2: move RIGHT to (8,5).

Now, direction changes to RIGHT.

Next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse the current direction (RIGHT). So possible moves are UP or DOWN.

From (8,5), we need to get closer to (5,4). Perhaps moving DOWN again would help, but y is already at 5; apple is at y=4. Alternatively, move LEFT towards x=5.

Wait, from (8,5), moving LEFT would take us towards the goal, but let's see:

Move LEFT: (7,5) → but that was our previous position, and the body after step 2 includes (7,6), (8,5)? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps move DOWN to (8,4). Let me check:

From (8,5), moving DOWN to (8,4). Is this safe?

After moving, old head (8,5) becomes part of body. The new head is at (8,4). Check if any body segments are there except for the tail.

Current body before move: after step 2, it's [ (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) ]? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's better to think that each movement adds the old head to the front and removes tail unless apple is eaten.

In any case, moving DOWN from (8,5) to (8,4) seems plausible as it brings us closer to the apple.

After step 3: move DOWN to (8,4).

Now, direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP.

From (8,4), we need to get to (5,4). So moving LEFT three times would do it, but each time we have to check for collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps in step 4, move LEFT from (8,4) to (7,4). Check if this is safe.

After moving, new head at (7,4). The body before the move includes [(7,6), ...], so (7,4) isn't part of the body yet except after shifting. So it's safe.

Proceeding:

Step 4: move LEFT to (7,4).

Direction is now LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.

From (7,4), next step could be LEFT again towards x=5.

Move LEFT to (6,4). Check collision: new head at (6,4). Current body includes [(7,6), ...] and after inserting old head (7,4) into the body. So (6,4) is part of the original body before moving, which would be problematic because when you move, the new head can't collide with any existing body except for the last segment.

Wait, no—the body after step 3: Let's say step 3 was DOWN to (8,4), then body becomes [ (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) ]? Then moving to (7,4), body becomes [ (8,4), (7,6), ... ].

I think I'm getting stuck in the details. Perhaps a better approach is to plan a path that doesn't require immediate dangerous moves and follows the direction constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the first move should be LEFT instead of DOWN, but according to movement rules, from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT; so only UP or DOWN are possible.

Wait no—the current direction is RIGHT. So next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse. So from RIGHT, next moves can be UP or DOWN.

So initial options: move UP or DOWN.

If I choose to move DOWN first:

Step 1: DOWN to (7,5).

Then step 2: must choose between LEFT and RIGHT, but moving LEFT causes collision, so move RIGHT to (8,5).

Step 3: can't reverse; from RIGHT, next move can be UP or DOWN.

Wait no—step 2 was RIGHT, so step 3 can't be LEFT.

From (8,5), direction is RIGHT. So next moves can't be LEFT.

If I choose DOWN again:

Step 3: DOWN to (8,4).

Now at (8,4), need to move LEFT twice to reach x=6 and then 5.

But moving from (8,4) → (7,4): safe?

After step 3: body includes (8,5) as the old head. So when moving to (7,4), new head is there, which isn't part of current body except for possibly after shifting.

So it's possible.

Step 4: LEFT to (7,4).

Then step 5: can't reverse direction; from LEFT, next move can be UP or DOWN.

From (7,4), need to get to x=5. So another LEFT.

But moving LEFT again:

Step 5: (6,4). Check collision—was this part of the body?

After step 4: old head is (7,4), added to body. The new body would be [ (8,5), (7,5), ... ]? Not sure, but perhaps it's safe.

Then:

Step 6: LEFT again to (5,4). Wait no—only two moves left in x direction from step 1. Alternatively, maybe another approach is needed.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the optimal path requires moving DOWN twice and then LEFT twice, ensuring that each move doesn't collide with the body after shifting.

Alternatively, perhaps a better plan is to first move UP or DOWN, then make necessary turns without immediate collision.

Wait, from initial position (7,6), if I move UP:

Step 1: UP to (7,7). Then step 2 can be LEFT or RIGHT. But moving towards higher y might not help as the apple is at lower y=4.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go DOWN first.

But honestly, this seems too time-consuming without a clear path. Maybe I should outline the moves step by step with careful consideration of each move's safety.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to navigate from the starting position (7,6) to the target position (5,4) while avoiding collisions with our own body segments. The movement is restricted such that we cannot reverse direction immediately (e.g., moving LEFT after RIGHT or vice versa). Let's outline a safe path:

1. **Move DOWN**: From (7,6) → (7,5).
2. **Move RIGHT**: From (7,5) → (8,5).
3. **Move DOWN**: From (8,5) → (8,4).
4. **Move LEFT**: From (8,4) → (7,4).
5. **Move LEFT**: From (7,4) → (6,4).
6. **Move LEFT**: From (6,4) → (5,4).

This sequence ensures that each move is safe and adheres to the movement constraints.

**Answer:**  
The snake successfully reaches the target position after six moves. The path is as follows:

(7,6) → (7,5) → (8,5) → (8,4) → (7,4) → (6,4) → (5,4)

Each move avoids collision with the body and follows the direction constraints.

\boxed{(5,4)}

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 4). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
