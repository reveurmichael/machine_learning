<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this user who is playing a Snake game on a 10x10 grid. The snake's head is at (6,7), and it's currently moving UP. There are some body parts behind the head at positions (6,6) and (5,5). The apple is located at (4,7). My goal is to plan a safe path for the snake's head from its current position to reach the apple without colliding with any walls or its own body.

First, I need to understand the movement rules thoroughly. The snake can't reverse direction on the first move, so if it was moving UP before, it can't immediately switch to DOWN unless it changes direction properly in a few steps. Also, each move must check for collisions not just with the walls but also with any body segments except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

Looking at the current state: the snake's head is at (6,7). The next segment behind is (6,6), then (5,5). So currently, moving UP from (6,7) would take the head to (6,8). Wait, but in this case, moving UP increases y by 1 because UP means y+1. But wait, according to the coordinate system provided, moving UP is (0, +1), so yes, it's correct.

But before making any move, I need to check for collisions. The new head position after moving UP would be (6,8). Let me see if that's a valid cell—yes, since 0 ≤ x <10 and 0 ≤ y <10 is satisfied because 6<10 and 8<10.

Next, I need to check if this new head position (6,8) collides with any body segments. The current body cells are [(6,7), (6,6), (5,5)]. Wait no, the body list given is [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]? Wait, in the problem statement, it says "Body cells: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]", so the snake's body starts from behind the head. So when moving UP, new_head would be at (6,8). The current body positions are (6,7) [head], then (6,6), (6,5), and (5,5).

Wait no, in the problem statement, it says: Body cells list excludes the head and goes from behind to tail. So for example, a full snake is [head, body1, body2,...bodyN]. So given that, when the head is at (4,4) and body1 is (4,3), etc.

In this case, the current head is (6,7). The body cells are [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. Wait no, looking back: "Body cells: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]"—so that's three segments behind. So in terms of the full snake S, it is [HEAD (6,7), BODY1 (6,6), BODY2 (6,5), BODY3 (5,5)]. 

When moving UP to (6,8), which is empty because none of the body cells are at (6,8). So collision check passes.

Now, according to movement rules: after computing new_head, we update the body. Since it's not an apple move (new_head isn't (4,7) yet), the tail will be removed. So inserting the old head (6,7) at the front of the body list gives us [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. Then we remove the last element because it's not an apple move—so the new body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. 

Updating HEAD to be new_head (6,8). So after this move, the snake would look like:

HEAD: (6,8)
BODY1: (6,7)
BODY2: (6,6)
BODY3: (6,5)

But wait, that seems odd because moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8), then inserting (6,7) as BODY1. But the body list before was [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. So after adding the new head and removing the tail, it should be [new_head, old_head, ...]. Hmm.

Wait no, according to movement update rule 2: 

a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1). 
b. If not eating apple, remove last element so total length remains same.

So current body is [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]—length 3. After moving to (6,8), we add it to the front as BODY1: [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5) ] and then remove last element because not eating apple? Wait no: step a is inserting new_head's position into the beginning of the body list before any removal. Then in step b, if not eating apple, we need to remove the tail.

Wait, let me re-express:

- The current full snake S is [head (6,7), body1 (6,6), body2 (6,5), body3 (5,5)]. 

After moving UP:
new_head = (6,8).

Insert new_head into the beginning: so the body becomes [(6,8), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)].

Then, since not eating apple, we remove the last element of the body list—so it's now [(6,8), (6,6), (6,5)].

So the new snake is [ (6,8) as head, (6,7), wait no. Wait a minute: I think I'm mixing up how the body list works. The body list given in input is [body1, body2,..., tail], so when moving UP:

new_head = (6,8). 

Inserting new_head at front of the current body list [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)] gives us a temporary body: [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

Then, since it's not an apple move, we remove the last element. So the new body becomes [(6,8), (6,6), (6,5)].

Wait but then in this case, the new body list has 3 elements: [head is at position (6,8), then (6,6), (6,5)]. But that seems like a problem because after inserting, we have four positions, remove one to get three again. So the tail would be (5,5) before any removal.

So moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8):

- new_head is valid.
- no collision with body except if new_head is at position of the tail's next position— but after inserting and removing, does that create a problem?

Wait maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently.

The current snake S is:

HEAD: (6,7)
BODY1: (6,6)
BODY2: (6,5)
BODY3: (5,5)

After moving UP to (6,8):

new_head = (6,8).

Update body list by inserting new_head at front. Now the temporary body is [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

But since it's not an apple move, we remove the last element (5,5). So now the body becomes [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5) ].

Wait but then the new S is:

HEAD: (6,8)
BODY1: (6,7)—no wait, where did that come from? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how the old head position is inserted into the body list. Wait no—inserting the old head into the front of the current body list gives [new_head] + current_body.

But when moving, we first insert new_head to make a temporary list and then remove if necessary.

Wait in movement step 2:

After computing new_head = (6,8), check for collision. Then do step 3a: insert old head into the front of the body list—so that's inserting (6,7) at position 0, making it [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

Then step 3b: if not eating apple, remove last element. So new body is [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

But then the snake's head becomes (6,8), and the body segments are (6,7), (6,6), (6,5). That seems problematic because (6,7) was the previous head. How does that work?

Wait I think perhaps the way to model this is:

The snake's current body list is [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

After moving UP:

new_head = (6,8).

We add new_head at front: so the temporary body becomes [(6,8), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)].

Then, since it's not an apple move, we remove last element to keep length same. So body list is now [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5) ].

But that leaves the snake as:

HEAD: (6,8)
BODY1: (6,7)—wait no, because when you insert new_head into the front of current_body, it's added before all existing body parts. Then we remove from the end if not apple move.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe in step 3a, after inserting new_head at the front, which is (6,8), then when we add that to the beginning and possibly remove the last element because it's not an apple move.

So body list was [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ] before movement. After insertion: [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ]. Then since no apple, remove last element to become [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5) ].

So new head is (6,8). The body segments are now (6,7)—no, wait the previous head was at (6,7). How does that come into play?

Wait perhaps when you insert the old head's position as BODY1. So the old head was at (6,7), and inserting it before the current body list gives us [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

Then removing last element because not eating apple: so [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

Wait now, the new head is (6,8). So in this case, after moving UP:

- The snake's body has changed to [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

But that would mean that from position (6,8), it goes back to (6,7), then (6,6), and so on. That seems like a problem because now the head is at (6,8), but the body includes where it was before moving.

Wait perhaps this approach isn't correct. Let me think about how to represent the snake's body correctly.

Another way: The current snake is:

HEAD: (6,7)

Then, behind that are the body parts: (6,6), then (6,5), and then (5,5). So when moving forward UP, the new head is at (6,8).

In movement step 3a: insert old head (6,7) to front of current body list [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ] → becomes [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

Then step 3b: since not apple move, remove last element. So it's now [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

Thus, the new snake body is [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]— but that would mean after moving, the head moves to (6,8), and the rest shift accordingly. Wait no—that can't be because adding (6,7) in front of current body list, which was [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ], gives us a new body list that is longer by one before step 3b.

So:

After inserting new_head at the beginning: new_body = [new_head] + current_body → [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

Then, if not apple move, remove last element. So final body list is [ (6,8), (6,6), (6,5) ].

But wait that would imply the snake's head has moved to (6,8), but the first segment now is still at (6,7)—which was the previous head? That seems contradictory because the old head position should be behind. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the insertion works.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving forward, you're supposed to insert your new_head into the beginning of the body list, but in such a way that it's just adding one segment and removing the last if needed. But in this case, since current_body has length 3 (excluding head), inserting new_head makes it length 4, then remove last element brings back to length 3.

So after movement:

head is at (6,8)

body list becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]

But that still includes the previous head position. That seems like a mistake because you shouldn't have your body segments pointing to where you just moved from.

Wait perhaps it's not correct to include the old_head as the first element of the body list. Maybe in step 3a, when inserting new_head at front, we should remove any references to previous head?

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this and need to focus on what is required for collision checking.

In this case, moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8):

- Is the new_head in bounds? Yes.
- Do any body segments occupy (6,8)? The current body cells are [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. So no. So collision is not an issue here.

But after moving:

the snake's head will be at (6,8). Then the body list becomes [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) ]— but wait that includes the previous position of the head?

Wait perhaps I'm getting confused with how the body segments are being updated.

Alternatively, maybe after moving UP to (6,8):

- The new_head is inserted at the front of the current_body list: so [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].
- Then since it's not an apple move, we remove the last element → [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

Thus, the new snake is:

HEAD: (6,8)
BODY1: (6,7)—this was previous head
BODY2: (6,6)
BODY3: (6,5)

Wait that can't be correct because after moving forward, your body should not include where you just came from.

I think the issue here is how I'm updating the body list. Maybe when inserting new_head into front of current_body and then removing last element only if necessary, but perhaps it's better to model the snake as a linked list or something else.

Wait maybe this approach isn't working for me right now; perhaps moving in another direction first would be safer.

If I move LEFT instead of UP. Let's see:

Current head is at (6,7). Moving LEFT decreases x by 1: new_head = (5,7).

Check if that's a valid position—yes, because 5 >=0 and <10. Then check for collision with body segments.

The current body cells are [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)].

So inserting new_head at front of the current_body: [ (5,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

Since not eating apple, remove last element. So body becomes [ (5,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

Now the snake is:

HEAD: (5,7)
BODY1: (6,6)—wait that was behind before
Wait no—step a says insert new_head at front of current_body list [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)], resulting in [ (5,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].

Then step b: since not apple move, remove last element. So body becomes [ (5,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

So the snake's head is at (5,7). The rest of its body is [(6,6), (6,5)]. 

Wait that still doesn't resolve anything because now the head has moved left to (5,7), but then how does it connect?

Alternatively, perhaps this movement leads us towards apple in a couple steps.

But moving LEFT from (6,7) would get you closer to column 0 which is where apple isn't located. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN—since the snake's current head is at row 6, moving DOWN would take it to row 5: new_head = (5,7). Wait that’s similar to moving LEFT in terms of x coordinate change but different y coordinate change.

Wait no—if you're moving DOWN from (6,7), then y decreases by 1—so new_head is (5,7).

But same as above. So perhaps moving RIGHT? But the snake's head is at column 6; moving right would take it to column 7: but apple is at (4,7). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe a combination of moves could be needed.

Wait let me think about the required path from (6,7) to (4,7).

That's two steps to the LEFT—x decreasing by 2 each step. But perhaps due to body constraints, it can't do that directly without colliding with its own tail if not moving carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps making a U-turn or some other maneuvering around the snake's body.

Wait but in this case, since the current position is (6,7) and head direction is UP. So next move would be either to stay where it is (if it can't move), or try to move in another direction if possible.

But according to movement rules:

1. Current head is at (6,7); body parts are behind: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)].
2. Direction is UP; so next desired position would be (6,8).
3. Check for collision with any of the body cells.

But the current body cells do not include (6,8). So movement is possible without immediate collision. Then after moving:

- Insert new_head at front: [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].
- Remove last element if not apple move → [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

So the snake's body is now [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)] with head at (6,8). But that seems incorrect because the previous head was part of the body. Maybe I need to model this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving UP to (6,8), the new_body list should be [ (6,7) ] followed by current_body except last element? Wait no—current_body is [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. So inserting new_head at front and removing last would give:

new_body = [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) ]

Thus, the snake's body becomes that.

But in this scenario, moving UP leads to a body that includes where it was before. That can't be right because then it's overlapping itself—probably not possible.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating and should just think about whether moving in certain directions is possible given the current position and body constraints.

So from (6,7), head direction UP:

Possible moves are only those that don't cause immediate collision. So let me list out all potential new_head positions after this move step by step.

First, determine what cells are occupied by the snake's body: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. Additionally, we need to ensure that when moving forward in any direction, the next head position is not within these positions or overlapping with itself.

So for each possible move direction:

1. UP: new_head = (6,8). Check if it's occupied by body cells → no collision.
2. DOWN: new_head = (5,7). Check if it's in [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]? Yes, (5,5) is at (5,5)—so new_head would be (5,7), which isn't occupied yet. So no collision.
3. LEFT: new_head = (5,7). Check if in body → same as above—no collision.
4. RIGHT: new_head = (7,7). Not in body→ could be considered.

Wait but moving UP to (6,8) is the direction we were supposed to go since that's where the head was pointing earlier.

But perhaps moving LEFT would allow us to get closer to column 4 where apple is at (4,7).

Wait let me consider moving LEFT from current_head position (6,7). So new_head becomes (5,7):

Check if any body cell is now overlapping: snake's body cells are [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)].

So moving to (5,7) doesn't collide with these. So it's a possible move.

After moving LEFT:

- Insert new_head at front of current_body → [ (5,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ].
- Since not apple direction, remove last element: body becomes [ (5,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

Now the snake's head is at (5,7). Next move would be in which direction?

If we can keep moving towards LEFT again:

new_head = (4,7).

Check if that cell is occupied by any body cells? The current body after moving LEFT once was [ (5,7), (6,6), (6,5) ].

So new_head=(4,7). Is 4,7 in the snake's body? Let me check:

Current snake body: positions are head at (5,7), followed by (6,6), then (6,5).

Wait no—current snake after moving LEFT is [(5,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. So the body cells are these three points.

So new_head=(4,7) isn't in this list. So it's a possible move without immediate collision.

Thus, we can move LEFT again to get closer.

But let me make sure: after moving from head at (5,7), inserting new_head of (4,7):

new_body = [ (5,7), (6,6), (6,5) ] becomes:

[ (4,7), 5,7? Wait no. Let me think.

When moving to LEFT:

- current_body is [(5,7), (6,6), (6,5)].
Wait no—that's after first move from initial position.

No, wait step by step.

First time we moved LEFT from head at (6,7):

new_head = (5,7).

Insert into front of body list: [ (5,7) ] + current_body → but current_body was [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)] before movement. So inserting new_head gives:

[ (5,7), 6,6; 6,5; 5,5 ]

Then step b: since not apple move, remove last element→ [ (5,7), 6,6; 6,5 ].

Thus after first LEFT move, snake's body is [(5,7), (6,6), (6,5)] with head at (5,7).

Now when moving again to LEFT: new_head = (4,7). Check if this cell is in current_body positions?

Current_body list: [ (5,7); 6,6; 6,5 ]

Wait no—current body is [(5,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. So moving to (4,7) which isn't among these. Thus, collision check passes.

So movement is allowed.

Now insert new_head into front of current_body:

new_body = [ (4,7); 5,7; 6,6; 6,5 ]

Since it's not an apple move, remove last element → body becomes [ (4,7), 5,7; 6,6 ].

Wait no—current_body was [(5,7), (6,6), (6,5)]. So inserting new_head at front: [ (4,7) ; 5,7 ; 6,6 ; 6,5 ]

Then step b: remove last element → becomes [ (4,7); 5,7; 6,6 ].

Thus, the snake's head is now at (4,7), which is where apple is located. So that seems to be a solution—so moving left twice from current position would get us directly towards the apple.

But wait—are there any body parts blocking this movement?

Wait after first move: new_body was [ (5,7); 6,6; 6,5 ] with head at (5,7). Moving LEFT again:

new_head = (4,7).

Current_body is [(5,7); 6,6; 6,5].

So inserting new_head gives a list of four positions: [ (4,7), 5,7; 6,6; 6,5 ].

Then step b: remove last element → becomes [ (4,7), 5,7; 6,6 ].

But now, the head is at (4,7)—which is apple's position. So that seems like a valid move—snake can directly reach the apple by moving LEFT twice from current position.

Wait but wait: in reality, when you move your snake's head to (4,7), you have to ensure that all body parts are behind it and no overlapping occurs.

In this case, after first LEFT:

Body was at [5,7; 6,6; 6,5].

After second LEFT movement, the new_body is [4,7; 5,7; 6,6 ].

Wait but does that include any body parts?

Because in step a: you're inserting new_head into front of current_body list. So if current_body was [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3)], then after insertion it's [new_head] + current_body → 4 elements.

Then, since not apple move, remove last element→ becomes [new_head; x1,y1; x2,y2].

In this case, new_head is (4,7). The previous body was [(5,7); 6,6; 6,5].

So after movement:

[ (4,7) ; (5,7) ; (6,6) ]

Thus, the snake's head is at (4,7), which is apple. So no further movement needed.

But wait—that can't be correct because in reality, moving to that position would have left a gap between the new_head and previous positions?

No—because according to step 3a: insert new_head into front of current_body, then remove last element if it's not an apple move. So after two LEFT moves:

First movement from (6,7) → (5,7):

- Insert at front: [ (5,7); (6,6); (6,5); (5,5) ]
- Remove last element: [ (5,7); (6,6); (6,5) ]

Second movement to LEFT:

- new_head = 4,7
- Insert into front of current_body → [ (4,7), (5,7), (6,6), (6,5) ]
- Remove last element: becomes [ (4,7), (5,7), (6,6) ]

So now the snake's body is [(4,7); 5,7; 6,6].

Wait but head is at (4,7). So this seems like a viable position. But in reality, moving twice to LEFT from current_head would give us that position.

But I need to confirm if after these two movements, the snake's body doesn't have any overlapping cells or block itself.

At each step:

- After first move: head at (5,7), body parts [(6,6); (6,5)]
Wait no—after first movement:

new_body is [ (5,7) ] + current_body → but current_body was after initial position?

Wait perhaps I'm getting confused with how the snake's body list represents itself.

Alternatively, maybe modeling this as a linked list would be better. Each segment of the snake follows the previous one.

But regardless, based on these calculations, moving LEFT twice from (6,7) would get us to apple at (4,7). Is that possible?

Wait but wait—originally, the body parts are [(6,6); (6,5); (5,5)].

When we move head to (5,7), inserting into front and removing last gives:

new_body = [ (5,7); 6,6; 6,5 ]

Then moving again to LEFT: new_head is (4,7).

Inserting this in front of current_body:

[4,7] + [5,7;6,6;6,5 ] → [4,7;5,7;6,6;6,5]

Since it's not apple move, remove last element→ becomes [4,7;5,7;6,6 ]

So the snake's body is now:

- Head at (4,7)
- Followed by (5,7) and then (6,6)

But wait—does that create any overlap with previous positions?

Wait in step 3a: insert new_head into front of current_body list.

Current_body before second movement was [(5,7);6,6;6,5].

After inserting (4,7), the body is [4,7] ; [5,7;6,6;6,5 ]

But then we remove last element which is 6,5. So after removing, it's:

[4,7;5,7;6,6 ]

So now, the snake's body is at (4,7), followed by (5,7) and (6,6). But that seems to have a gap from previous positions.

But in reality, when moving left twice, you're effectively positioning your head correctly with no overlaps. So it might be possible.

Wait another thing: when moving the snake's head to 4,7, are there any body parts at (4,5) or anything? Probably not—so it should be safe.

Thus, based on this logic, moving left twice from current position would get us directly onto apple without any collision. So that seems like a solution.

But wait—is the snake's direction changing correctly?

Wait in the initial state: head at (6,7), body parts are [(6,6);(6,5);(5,5)]—so moving up is towards (6,8). But then we tried to move left twice for (4,7).

But perhaps there are other directions that could also reach apple in fewer moves.

Alternatively, maybe moving down or right first might lead us closer. Let me check those possibilities.

Moving DOWN from current head position:

new_head = 5,7.

Is that cell occupied by body? The snake's body is at (6,6;6,5;5,5). So new_head=5,7 isn't in the body. So no collision.

After moving DOWN: inserting new_head into front of current_body.

current_body was [(6,6);(6,5);(5,5)]

So after movement:

new_body = [ (5,7) ] + [6,6; 6,5;5,5] → four elements. Then remove last element→ becomes [5,7;6,6;6,5].

Now the head is at (5,7), body parts are [(6,6);(6,5)].

From there, if we move left again: new_head=(4,7).

Check if that's occupied by current_body. Current_body is [5,7;6,6;6,5]. So 4,7 isn't in this list—no collision.

Insert into front of body:

new_body = [ (4,7);5,7;6,6;6,5 ]

Then remove last element→ becomes [4,7;5,7;6,6 ].

Now the head is at 4,7. So again, same as moving twice to LEFT from initial position.

Thus, whether you move left first or down first, moving left next brings you directly to apple in two moves. But wait—is that accurate?

Wait no—moving DOWN then moving LEFT would actually require more steps? Let me think.

From initial head (6,7):

1st movement: DOWN → 5,7

Body becomes [5,7;6,6;6,5]

2nd movement: LEFT →4,7

But body after two movements is[4,7;5,7;6,6]—so this gets us to apple.

Similarly, moving twice LEFT from initial position also gets us there in two steps. So both routes take same number of moves.

Thus, either direction (left or down) can be taken first, then left again to reach apple in two moves.

But wait, perhaps we should consider the minimum path—so is it possible that with fewer moves?

Alternatively, let's check if moving in another initial direction could get us directly to apple without needing more steps. For example:

Current head (6,7). Could we move RIGHT once? To 7,7?

Check for collision: body parts at (6,6;6,5;5,5)—so new_head=7,7 isn't in that list—so no collision.

So movement is allowed. Then insert into front of current_body:

new_body = [7,7] + [6,6;6,5;5,5 ] → four elements.

Then since not apple move, remove last element→ becomes[7,7;6,6;6,5 ]

Now head at 7,7. Next movement? To which direction?

Moving right again would take us to 8,7—probably outside the grid or beyond, but depending on game area size.

But if allowed, maybe moving further could get us closer, but I think it's more steps than necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps from 7,7 we can move UP:

new_head=7,8. Check for collision with current_body [(7,7);6,6;6,5]?

Current_body doesn't include (7,8). So no collision.

Thus movement is allowed—inserting into front and removing last element→ becomes [7,8;7,7;6,6 ]

Now head at 7,8. But moving further right or up would take us away from apple position (4,7).

Therefore, it's not a feasible path towards the goal.

So perhaps moving RIGHT is a detour and will lead to more steps than necessary.

Alternatively, after moving RIGHT once:

Current head is at 7,7; body parts are [6,6;6,5;5,5 ] → but with new movement added?

Wait no: when you move to the right first time, current_body becomes [(7,7);6,6;6,5 ]

So if we continue moving in various directions, perhaps it would take more steps than moving LEFT towards apple.

Therefore, based on that analysis, it seems that moving two times to LEFT from initial position gets us directly onto apple with minimal moves. Similarly, moving DOWN then LEFT also achieves the same in two moves.

But wait—could there be a scenario where we can reach apple in one move? Probably not because current head is at (6,7), and apple is at (4,7). The straight line distance is two cells leftward or perhaps a different path. So moving twice to LEFT from initial position would get us directly.

Thus, based on the analysis, the minimum number of moves required is 2: moving twice to LEFT.

But wait—I should verify whether in each step after first move, there are no body collisions:

After first movement (LEFT):

Head at (5,7); body parts [(6,6;6,5)]

No collision—OK.

Second movement (LEFT): head at (4,7); body parts [5,7;6,6]

But wait in this case, the snake's body is now:

[5,7;6,6 ]

So previous positions were: 6,7→ then moving LEFT to 5,7, then again LEFT to 4,7. So snake's body after two movements would be:

- Head at (4,7)
- Body part behind: (5,7)
- Then (6,6)

But does that mean any of these positions interfere with each other? I think in this configuration, the snake is progressing towards apple without overlapping.

Alternatively, perhaps after second movement, we have to check if the new_head's position is valid and doesn't collide with previous parts.

Thus, as per above logic, moving twice to LEFT would be sufficient. Similarly for DOWN then LEFT.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple by moving left twice from its current head position at (6,7). 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The initial position of the snake is head at (6,7) with body parts at (6,6), (6,5), and (5,5).
2. Move left once: Head moves to (5,7). Body becomes [(6,6), (6,5)].
3. Move left again: Head reaches apple's position at (4,7). Body is now [(5,7), (6,6)].

Answer: The snake can reach the apple by moving left twice.

$\boxed{\text{Move left twice}}$

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (4, 7). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
