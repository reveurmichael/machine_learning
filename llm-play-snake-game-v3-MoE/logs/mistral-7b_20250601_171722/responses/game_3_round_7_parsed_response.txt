  "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake is currently at (7,3). The apple is at (6,1). To avoid collision and maintain continuity of body segments, we move the snake downwards to (7,2) first. Then, we move it to the right towards the apple at (6,1), while ensuring there's no immediate self-collision or trap."
