  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,9) with the head and one body segment at (0,8). The apple is at (9,1). The shortest path requires moving right 9 times and down 8 times. The initial moves avoid the body segment and stay within bounds."
