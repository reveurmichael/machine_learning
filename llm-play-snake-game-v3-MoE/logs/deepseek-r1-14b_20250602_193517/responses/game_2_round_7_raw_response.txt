========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (7,5) to eat the apple at (7,5). Wait, that's the same position. Hmm, that seems a bit odd because the head is already on the apple's spot. But according to the problem statement, the head is at (7,5), and the apple is also at (7,5). So does that mean the snake is already on the apple? Or maybe it's just about to eat it?

Looking back at the inputs, the head is at (7,5) and the apple is also there. But in the game rules, when the new_head equals the apple position, the snake grows. So if the head is moving towards where the apple is, but since they're already on the same cell, maybe the move needs to be such that the head moves somewhere else and then comes back?

Wait, no. The head is at (7,5), and the apple is also there. So perhaps the snake can immediately eat the apple without moving? But in the movement rules, each move involves changing direction. Or does the initial position count as having eaten the apple already? That seems unlikely because usually, the apple is separate from the snake.

So I think the problem here is that the head and the apple are on the same cell, but to eat it, the snake must move into that cell. But since the head is already there, maybe no movement is needed, but according to the movement rules, each turn requires a direction change unless it's NONE.

Wait, the current direction is "LEFT". So if I don't choose any direction next, can I just stay put? Or do I have to make a move?

But in the movement rules, direction choices are "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", so perhaps "NONE" isn't an option except for the first move. Wait, no: looking back, the current direction is given as "LEFT". So the snake is currently moving left.

So, if I'm at (7,5) and the apple is also there, but since the head can't stay on the same cell unless it's moving into it via a valid direction, perhaps I need to find a way for the head to move into (7,5), but that's already where it is. This seems confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the apple and the head are not on the same position in reality; maybe it's a typo or something else. Let me check the inputs again.

Inputs:
- Head: (7,5)
- Body cells: [(8,5), (8,4), ..., (8,0)] — so the snake is moving left along y=5 from x=8 down to 0.
- Apple position: (7,5)

So the apple is just one cell away to the left of the head. Because the head is at (7,5), and the body is behind it: [(8,5), ...], meaning the snake's body starts at (8,5) and goes down to (8,0). So the head is at (7,5), which is one cell left of the first body segment.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when moving left, each body segment follows the previous. So the head is at (7,5), and the next body segments are at (8,5) behind it.

So the apple is at (7,5), same as the head. But in reality, I think that's not possible because the snake can't be on the apple's cell unless it's about to eat it. So perhaps this is an error in the problem statement, but I need to proceed with what's given.

So if the head is at (7,5), and the apple is also there, then according to the movement rules, when the snake moves into that cell, which is already its current position, it would eat the apple. But how does the movement work in this case?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial state. The head is at (7,5). The body starts at (8,5), moving leftwards towards (8,4), etc., down to (8,0). So the snake's path is from (7,5) → (8,5) → ... → (8,0). That would imply that the head was previously at (8,5), moved left to (7,5).

So the body cells are ordered from behind the head to the tail. So in this case, after moving left, the body is [(8,5), ...], which means the next segment is (8,5) behind the head.

Now, the apple is at (7,5), same as the head's position. But according to the movement rules, when the new_head equals the apple's position, the snake grows. So in this case, if the head doesn't move, it would eat the apple and grow without moving.

But wait, movement requires a direction change. The current direction is "LEFT", so the next move can't be the opposite, which would be "RIGHT". But since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can be any direction except RIGHT? Or is there another constraint?

Wait, no: rule 2 says you cannot reverse. So if current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN next, etc. So for current direction LEFT, the forbidden direction is RIGHT.

So from LEFT, I can choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT again? Wait, no. Because moving in the same direction is allowed unless it's a reversal. Reversing would be choosing the opposite direction.

Wait, the movement rules say: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current direction is LEFT, can't choose RIGHT next.

So from LEFT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT? Or is choosing the same direction allowed?

I think moving in the same direction is allowed. Reversing is not allowed. So if I'm currently moving LEFT, I can move LEFT again, but not RIGHT.

Wait, that seems a bit odd because movement would just continue in the same direction unless changed.

So, back to the problem: The snake's head is at (7,5), moving LEFT. The body is behind it at (8,5). So the snake is facing left, with its body extending to the right.

The apple is at (7,5), which is the same as the head's position. But that can't be right because then the snake is already on the apple. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Alternatively, perhaps the apple is at a different position, but in this case, it's given as (7,5). So regardless of that, I need to find a path for the snake to eat the apple.

But if the head is already on the apple, then moving into it would cause the snake to grow. However, since movement requires changing direction unless it's NONE, but current direction is LEFT.

Wait, perhaps the apple is at (7,5), and the head is also there, so the snake can eat it without moving. But that seems impossible because you need to move to eat the apple. Or maybe in this case, the apple is already being eaten by the head, and the next step would involve growing.

But according to movement rules, when new_head == apple position, the snake grows. So if the new_head is at (7,5), which is where the apple is, then it's a valid move, and the snake grows.

So perhaps the only move needed is to not move in this step? But that's conflicting with the movement rules because you have to choose a direction each turn unless it's NONE. So perhaps the current state is such that no movement is needed, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the apple is not at (7,5) but somewhere else, and there was a typo in the problem statement. But since it's given as (7,5), I have to work with that.

Wait, perhaps the body cells are [(8,5), ...], meaning that the snake is moving left from (8,5) towards lower x values. So the head is at (7,5), which is one step left of (8,5). So if it continues moving LEFT, the next position would be (6,5), and so on.

But since the apple is at (7,5), same as the head's current position, perhaps the snake needs to make a move that brings it back into that cell. But that seems impossible because you can't reverse direction immediately.

Wait, no. The current direction is LEFT, so moving RIGHT would be reversing and thus invalid. So the next move can't be RIGHT.

So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But since the apple is at (7,5), which is where the head is, perhaps moving in a way that allows the head to stay there without collision, but according to movement rules, you have to choose a direction each turn unless it's NONE. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe this scenario is impossible because the head can't be on the apple's cell unless it just ate it. But since the head is already there, perhaps the snake has already eaten the apple and needs to make sure it doesn't collide with its body after growing.

Wait, but according to the movement rules, when new_head == apple position, the snake grows without moving the tail. So in this case, if the head moves into (7,5), which is where the apple is, then the body would grow by one cell, and the tail wouldn't move.

But wait, the head is already at (7,5). How can it move into that same position again? It must have moved from there in the previous step. So perhaps this is a scenario where the apple is placed on top of the head, allowing the snake to eat it without moving, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement has a typo, and the apple's position is different. But given that, I'll proceed with the information provided.

So, considering the current state: head at (7,5), body cells [(8,5), (8,4), ..., (8,0)], moving LEFT. The apple is at (7,5). So if the snake moves in any direction except RIGHT (since it can't reverse from LEFT to RIGHT), let's see what happens.

If I choose UP: new_head would be (7,6). Then check for collision with body cells. The body is behind at (8,5) and moving towards lower x. So the new head at (7,6) wouldn't collide with any body cell because they are on different y's. So that move is safe.

But then, since the apple is at (7,5), which is where the head was, but after moving UP to (7,6), the snake would not be eating the apple anymore. Unless I can somehow come back down.

Alternatively, if I choose DOWN: new_head would be (7,4). Check for collision with body cells. The first body cell is at (8,5), which is two units right and one up from (7,4). So no collision there. Then the next body segment is (8,4), which is to the right of (7,4). So that's also not colliding.

Wait, but after moving down, would any part of the body be in (7,4)? The head is at (7,4), and the first body cell is at (8,5), next at (8,4) which is behind the head. Wait, no—wait, when you move, each body segment follows the previous one.

So if the snake moves DOWN from (7,5) to (7,4), then the previous head position (7,5) becomes part of the body. So the new body would be [(8,5), (7,5), (8,4), ...]. So the first segment is (8,5), then (7,5), which is now one behind the head.

So when moving DOWN to (7,4), the body segments would be:

- After move: head at (7,4)
- Body cells: [(8,5), (7,5), (8,4), (8,3), ..., (8,0)]

Wait, no. Because each segment follows the previous one. So after moving DOWN, the new body starts from where the head was before the move.

So when you move from (7,5) to (7,4), the old position (7,5) becomes part of the body. Then the next segments would be the previous ones shifted.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that after moving DOWN, there's no collision with any body cells except possibly the new position.

But in this case, the head is at (7,4), and the first body cell is (8,5). So they're not overlapping.

So if I move DOWN to (7,4), then check for collisions: only the head is there, no other parts of the body. So that's safe.

But since the apple was at (7,5), which is where the head used to be, after moving down, it's no longer on the apple's position. So perhaps I need to find a way to have the head move into the apple's cell.

Wait, but if the apple is at (7,5), and the head is already there, maybe the snake can eat it without moving. But according to movement rules, you still have to choose a direction unless it's NONE. So perhaps in this case, choosing not to move would cause the head to stay, thus eating the apple.

But I'm not sure if "NONE" is allowed as a direction choice when current direction is LEFT. Looking back at the movement rules: direction choices are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, except for NONE which can be chosen only on the first step unless specified otherwise.

Wait, no: looking back, in the problem statement, it says that the current direction is "LEFT", so I think the next move cannot be NONE; you have to choose a direction from UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (since RIGHT would reverse).

So perhaps in this scenario, since the head is already on the apple's position, moving any direction except RIGHT would allow the snake to eat the apple. But that doesn't make sense because the head was already there.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial state. Perhaps the apple is not at (7,5) but somewhere else, and it's a typo. But given the problem statement, I have to proceed with what's provided.

Given all this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to choose a direction that doesn't cause collision and allows the snake to eat the apple. Since the head is already on the apple, maybe no move is needed, but according to movement rules, you must choose a direction.

So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

If I choose to stay in LEFT, then the new_head would be (6,5). But that's moving away from the apple. Alternatively, choosing UP or DOWN would make the head move in those directions.

But since the apple is at (7,5), perhaps moving up or down and then returning later could allow the snake to eat it again. However, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a simple answer where the snake doesn't need to move because it's already on the apple. So perhaps the correct response is that no movement is needed, but according to movement rules, you have to choose a direction. But since "NONE" isn't allowed unless it's the first step.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should just provide an example of a move that doesn't cause collision and allows the snake to eat the apple.

If I choose to move DOWN from (7,5) to (7,4), then since the apple is at (7,5), which is where the head was, perhaps after moving down, the snake hasn't eaten the apple yet. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I choose to move LEFT again: new_head would be (6,5). Then, in the next step, could I reverse direction and move RIGHT back? But reversing from LEFT to RIGHT is forbidden.

So perhaps moving UP or DOWN is safer.

Wait, another thought: since the apple is at (7,5), which is where the head is, perhaps when the snake moves into that cell again, it would eat the apple. So if I choose any direction except RIGHT, and in doing so, move away from (7,5), then I might not be able to come back.

But since you can't reverse immediately, moving UP or DOWN would take you away from the apple's position. So perhaps there's no way for the snake to eat the apple again unless it somehow comes back without reversing direction.

This is confusing. Maybe in this scenario, the snake has already eaten the apple and just needs to make a move that doesn't cause collision.

So, considering all that, perhaps choosing to move UP or DOWN is safe. Let's pick moving UP as an example.

After moving UP from (7,5) to (7,6), check for collisions: no body cells are at (7,6), so it's safe.

But the apple is still at (7,5). So perhaps this doesn't help eat the apple.

Alternatively, maybe since the head was on the apple, the snake has already eaten it without moving. But according to movement rules, you have to choose a direction each turn unless it's NONE, but in this case, current direction is LEFT, so you can't choose NONE.

This is quite perplexing. I think perhaps the initial problem statement might have an error with the apple's position being the same as the head's. If that's not intended, maybe the apple should be elsewhere, like (7,6) or (6,5), making it easier to reach.

But given the constraints, perhaps the answer is simply to move in any direction except RIGHT, such as UP or DOWN.
