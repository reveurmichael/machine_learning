========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": [],
"reasoning": "The snake's body forms a vertical barrier at x=4 from y=0 to y=9, blocking all movement to the right of x=4. The apple is located at (9,8), which is to the right of this barrier. Due to the barrier and the snake's body occupying surrounding positions, there is no safe path to reach the apple without colliding with the body or grid boundaries."
