```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake is currently at (7,4), with the apple located at (7,1). To avoid colliding with the body and staying within the grid bounds, we first move 'DOWN' to reach (6,4) and then move 'RIGHT' to reach the apple at (7,1). This plan ensures safety and follows the rules for movement and continuity."
