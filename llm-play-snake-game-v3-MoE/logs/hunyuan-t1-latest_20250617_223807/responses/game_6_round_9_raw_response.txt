========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 5 units right (from x=3 to 8) and 3 units down (from y=8 to 5). Starting with RIGHT moves avoids reversing direction and navigates around the snake's vertical body. After reaching (8,8), moving DOWN three times reaches the apple at (8,5). Each move checks for collisions with the body (which shifts safely) and stays within grid bounds. After eating the apple, there are valid next moves (e.g., DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), preventing entrapment."
