  "moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (7,4). The path moves the snake towards the apple at (5,9) following the movement rules. It prioritizes moves that reduce the x coordinate towards 5 and increases the y coordinate towards 9 while adhering to the constraint that the last move cannot be the opposite of the previous one."
