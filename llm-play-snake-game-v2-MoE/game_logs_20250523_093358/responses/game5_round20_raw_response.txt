========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

To plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple at (7, 7) from its current position (9, 1), let's analyze the situation and consider the movement rules.

First, we need to determine how many moves are necessary in each direction:
- The horizontal difference between (9, 1) and (7, 7): 9 - 7 = 2
- The vertical difference between (9, 1) and (7, 7): 7 - 1 = 6

We need to move 2 positions LEFT and 6 positions UP.

Let's consider the current direction which is DOWN. To reach the apple, we must first stop going down (by changing direction), then move left and up.

Here's a potential sequence of moves:
1. Change from DOWN to LEFT (since we can't reverse directly)
2. Move 2 times LEFT
3. Change to UP
4. Move 6 times UP

Now let's check if this path avoids collisions with the snake's body and ensures there are no traps.

Given the snake's current position at (9, 1) and its body at [(9, 3), (9, 2)], we can see that moving LEFT twice will take us to (7, 1). Then, moving UP six times from (7, 1) to (7, 7) should be collision-free.

Let's construct the JSON output with this reasoning:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "First move LEFT twice to reach (7, 1), then UP six times to reach the apple at (7, 7). This path avoids collisions with the body and ensures there are no traps."
}
```

This JSON object meets all constraints and safely guides the snake to eat the apple.
