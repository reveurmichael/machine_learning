========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,5) with no body, so it can move freely. To reach (8,3), we need 3 RIGHT moves (x from 5→8) and 2 DOWN moves (y from 5→3). These moves are within grid bounds, avoid body collisions (no body initially), and after reaching the apple, there are legal next moves (e.g., LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) to avoid trapping."
