========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 4 times (from x=7 to x=3) and down 5 times (from y=5 to y=0). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing the initial DOWN direction and navigates toward the apple. Subsequent LEFT moves continue leftward, then DOWN moves descend to the apple's y-coordinate. Each step avoids body collisions, and after reaching the apple, there are valid moves (LEFT/RIGHT) to avoid trapping."
