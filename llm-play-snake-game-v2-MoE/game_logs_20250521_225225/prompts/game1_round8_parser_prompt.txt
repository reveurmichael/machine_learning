You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out how to get the snake from (7,6) to eat the apple at (5,6). The snake's head is currently there, moving left would take it towards the apple since x decreases by 1 each move. But wait, direction can't reverse on the first move. So if it was going right before, now it's LEFT. But in this case, from (7,6), to get closer to (5,6) which is two units left, moving LEFT twice should work.

Looking at body cells: [(8,6)], so the snake occupies (7,6), then next segment is (8,6). So when moving LEFT, the new head would be (6,6). Is that position free? Yes, because (6,6) isn't in the body. Also, check if it's within bounds: 0 ≤ x,y <10.

So move LEFT once to get closer, and then again. Each time checking for collisions with body or walls. Since after first LEFT, the snake becomes [(7,6), (8,6)] moving to (6,6). Then next move would be another LEFT to (5,6). At that point, the snake's head is at apple's position.

But I have to make sure that when it eats the apple, it doesn't get trapped. After eating, tail remains unless eaten again. So after moving LEFT twice, the body will be [(7,6), (8,6), (5,6)]. Then next move must not lead to a dead end. The next possible moves should be such that there's at least one legal direction left.

Also considering Manhattan distance: from (7,6) to (5,6) is 2 units left and same y. So the number of LEFTs minus RIGHTs should equal 2, which will happen with two LEFTs. The UP and DOWN moves difference is zero because y remains same. 

I think moving LEFT twice directly towards the apple is safe without reversing direction on first move. Let's plan that.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Move left twice to reach (5,6) safely."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(8, 6)], to eat the apple at (5, 6).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
