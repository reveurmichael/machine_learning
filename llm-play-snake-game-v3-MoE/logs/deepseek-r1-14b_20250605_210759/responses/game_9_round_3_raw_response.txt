========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from (2,2) to eat the apple at (6,9). The current direction is "DOWN", and the body cells are [(2,3), (2,4)]. So, let me break this down step by step.

First, the head is at (2,2). Since the snake's current direction is "DOWN", that means it's moving towards decreasing y-values. But the apple is at a higher y-coordinate (9 vs 2), so the snake needs to move upwards eventually. However, the immediate next move can't be "UP" because that would reverse the direction from "DOWN". So, the first move has to be either LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE—wait, no, since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. But in this case, the snake is at (2,2), and moving DOWN from here would take it to (2,1), which is outside the grid because y=0 is the bottom. So, actually, the snake can't move DOWN anymore without dying.

Wait, that's a problem. The current direction is "DOWN", but moving in that direction would immediately lead to a collision with the wall. Therefore, the first move must change direction. Since it can't reverse (i.e., can't go UP), it has to choose either LEFT, RIGHT, or another non-reversing direction.

Looking at the possible directions: LEFT would take it from (2,2) to (1,2). That's within bounds and not occupied by any body segments except possibly after moving. The body is [(2,3), (2,4)], which are behind the head. So, moving LEFT seems safe for the first move.

After moving LEFT to (1,2), the direction would now be "LEFT". Next, I need to plan a path that leads towards the apple at (6,9). Since the apple is northeast of the current position, the snake needs to move mostly RIGHT and UP.

But let's think about potential collisions. The body after moving LEFT would be [(2,2), (1,3), (1,4)]? Wait no—when you move, the old head becomes part of the body. So after moving LEFT, the new head is (1,2). The previous head was at (2,2), so the body becomes [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]. But wait, in the movement update rule, when you move, you insert the old head into the front of the BODY list. So after moving LEFT:

- New head is (1,2).
- The old head (2,2) is added to the body.
- Since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail.

So the new body would be [(2,2), (2,3)]—because the tail was at (2,4), which gets removed. Now, the snake's length remains 2+1 (head + body). Wait no, initial state has head and two body segments, so total of 3 cells. After moving, the head moves to (1,2), old head becomes part of body. So body list is [(2,2), (2,3)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, remove the last element, which was (2,4). So now, the body is just [(2,2)], making the snake's length 2.

Wait no, initial body is [(2,3), (2,4)]—so when you move, the head becomes (1,2), and the old head (2,2) is inserted into the front of the body. So the new body list before removing the tail is [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, remove the last element (2,4). So body becomes [(2,2), (2,3)], and head is (1,2).

Now, from (1,2) moving LEFT again would take it to (0,2), which is on the edge but still valid. But then, moving further in that direction might not be optimal because the apple is to the right and up.

Alternatively, after moving LEFT once, maybe change direction to UP or RIGHT.

Wait, let's plan a path:

1. Move LEFT to (1,2).
2. Then move UP repeatedly to reach higher y-coordinates.
3. But need to ensure that the body doesn't block the path.

But another approach is to first get into a position where it can start moving right towards the apple. Let me consider the coordinates:

Current head: (2,2)
Apple at (6,9). So x needs to increase by 4 and y by 7.

So ideally, we want to move mostly RIGHT and then UP.

But initial direction is DOWN, which is problematic because it can't be reversed on first move. So the snake must change direction immediately.

First move: LEFT or RIGHT. Let's see:

If I move RIGHT from (2,2), new head would be (3,2). Then, check if that's safe. The body after moving would have old head at (2,2) added to front of body [(2,3), (2,4)], making it [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]. Since we didn't eat an apple, remove tail (2,4). So body becomes [(2,2), (2,3)].

But after moving RIGHT, the direction is now "RIGHT", which is acceptable since previous was "DOWN" and not reverse. Then, next move could be UP or continue RIGHT.

Wait, but from (3,2), if we move UP to (3,3). Let's see:

After moving RIGHT to (3,2):

- Head is at (3,2).
- Body is [(2,2), (2,3)].
- Now, check collisions: new head (3,2) is not in the body except possibly after movement.

Next move could be UP to (3,3). Let's see:

- New head would be (3,3).
- Check if it's colliding with any body segments. The current body after moving right was [(2,2), (2,3)]. So when moving up, the new head is (3,3), which isn't in the body. Safe.

But wait, when you move, the old head becomes part of the body. So from (3,2), moving UP to (3,3):

- New head: (3,3).
- Insert old head (3,2) into front of body [(2,2), (2,3)] → new body list is [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)].
- Since we didn't eat an apple, remove tail (2,3). So body becomes [(3,2), (2,2)].

Then, head is at (3,3) with direction "UP". Next move could be UP again to (3,4).

But let's check if this path leads towards the apple. The apple is at (6,9), so we need to go right 4 and up 7. So after a few moves, perhaps moving right more would make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to first move in a way that allows the snake to build a longer body without blocking itself.

Another consideration: the apple is at (6,9). The snake needs to navigate around its own body and not get trapped. After eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn.

Perhaps the best initial moves are LEFT and then RIGHT to start moving towards the apple. Wait, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since the current direction is DOWN, which can't be reversed, the first move has to change direction. So moving LEFT or RIGHT.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move LEFT from (2,2) to (1,2). Now, head is at (1,2), body is [(2,2)], and length remains 2.
2. Then, move UP to (1,3). Check if this is safe.
   - New head: (1,3)
   - Body after inserting old head: [(2,2), (1,2)].
   - Remove tail (since no apple eaten yet) → body becomes [(2,2)].
   - No collision with body except perhaps the old head which is now part of the body. But since new_head is not equal to any BODYi except possibly after movement.

Wait, but according to rule 3.b and c, when moving, if you don't eat apple, you remove the tail. So after first move LEFT:

- Head: (1,2)
- Body: [(2,2)].

After second move UP to (1,3):

- New head: (1,3).
- Insert old head (1,2) into front → body becomes [(1,2), (2,2)].
- Remove tail (2,2) because not eating apple. So body is empty except for the new head.

Wait no, initial body after first move was [(2,2)]. After moving UP, insert old head (1,2), so body list is [(1,2), (2,2)], then remove tail (2,2). So body becomes [(1,2)].

So head is at (1,3), body at (1,2).

Now, next move could be RIGHT to (2,3):

- New head: (2,3)
- Insert old head (1,3) → body list becomes [(1,3), (1,2)]
- Remove tail (1,2). Body is empty? Wait no, initial body was [(1,2)], so after inserting new head, it's [(1,3), (1,2)], then remove the last element which is (1,2). So body becomes [(1,3)].

Wait that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify:

After each move, the old head is added to the front of the current body list, and if not eating apple, the tail is removed.

So initial state after first move LEFT:

- Head: (1,2)
- Body: [(2,2)] → total length 2.

Second move UP to (1,3):

- New head: (1,3).
- Insert old head (1,2) into front → body list becomes [(1,2), (2,2)].
- Remove tail (2,2) because no apple eaten. So new body is [(1,2)], length 2.

Third move RIGHT to (2,3):

- New head: (2,3).
- Insert old head (1,3) → body list becomes [(1,3), (1,2)].
- Remove tail (1,2). Body is [(1,3)], length 2.

So now, the snake is at (2,3) with body at (1,3).

Now, next move can be UP to (2,4):

- New head: (2,4).
- Insert old head (2,3) → body list becomes [(2,3), (1,3)].
- Remove tail (1,3). Body is empty except for new head and inserted old head? Wait no, when you remove the tail after adding the new head, let's see:

Wait, initial body before this move: [(1,3)]. Inserting old head (2,3), body becomes [(2,3), (1,3)]. Then, remove the tail which is (1,3). So body remains [(2,3)].

So head is at (2,4), body at (2,3).

Continuing up to y=9 would take 5 more moves. But then we also need to move right towards x=6.

This seems like a very slow process. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after the first move LEFT, maybe start moving RIGHT to build up the body in that direction.

Let me try:

1. Move LEFT to (1,2). Head: (1,2), body: [(2,2)].
2. Then, move RIGHT to (2,2). But wait, that's where the old head was. Is that allowed?

Wait no, because when you move RIGHT from (1,2), new head would be (2,2). But after moving LEFT, the body is [(2,2)]. So inserting (1,2) into front → body becomes [(1,2), (2,2)], then remove tail (2,2). So body is [(1,2)].

Then, moving RIGHT to (2,2):

- New head: (2,2).
- Insert old head (1,2) → body list becomes [(1,2), (2,2)].
- Remove tail (2,2). Body remains [(1,2)].

Wait, that seems like the snake is just oscillating between (1,2) and (2,2), which isn't helpful.

Perhaps moving UP after LEFT would be better. Let's try:

1. Move LEFT to (1,2).
2. Then move UP to (1,3). Now, head at (1,3), body [(2,2)].
   - After inserting old head (1,2), body becomes [(1,2), (2,2)], remove tail → body is [(1,2)].

Then, from (1,3):

3. Move RIGHT to (2,3). Now, head at (2,3), insert old head (1,3) into body → body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)]. Remove tail (1,2). So body is [(1,3)].

4. Then move UP to (2,4). Head at (2,4), insert old head (2,3), body becomes [(2,3), (1,3)], remove tail → body remains [(2,3)].

Now, the snake is moving upwards along x=2, y from 4 onwards. But that's still a long way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving LEFT once, then move RIGHT multiple times to get closer to the apple.

But wait, initial position after LEFT:

Head: (1,2), body: [(2,2)].

Then, move RIGHT twice:

Move 2: RIGHT → (2,2). But that's where the old head was. Is that safe?

Wait, no. Because when you move from (1,2) to (2,2):

- New head is (2,2).
- Insert old head (1,2) into body → [(1,2), (2,2)].
- Remove tail (2,2). So body becomes [(1,2)].

Now, the snake is back at (2,2) with body at (1,2). That doesn't help because it's just moving back and forth.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is needed. Since the initial direction is DOWN, which can't be used, the first move must change direction to LEFT or RIGHT.

Suppose we choose to move RIGHT first:

Move 1: RIGHT → (3,2). Now, head at (3,2), body becomes [(2,2), (2,3)] after inserting old head. Then remove tail (2,4) but wait, initial body was [(2,3), (2,4)]. So after moving right:

- New head: (3,2).
- Insert old head (2,2)? Wait no, the old head was at (2,2). But in the initial state, head is at (2,2), and body is [(2,3), (2,4)].

Wait, when moving from (2,2) to (3,2):

- New head: (3,2).
- Insert old head (2,2) into front of current body → [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)].
- Remove tail (2,4). So new body is [(2,2), (2,3)].

So now, the snake is at (3,2) with body cells at (2,2) and (2,3).

Next move could be UP to (3,3):

Move 2: UP → (3,3).
- Insert old head (3,2) into front of current body [(2,2), (2,3)] → [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)].
- Remove tail (2,3). So new body is [(3,2), (2,2)].

Now, at (3,3) with body cells at (3,2) and (2,2).

Next move could be UP to (3,4):

Move 3: UP → (3,4).
- Insert old head (3,3) into front of current body [(3,2), (2,2)] → [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2)].
- Remove tail (2,2). So new body is [(3,3), (3,2)].

Now, at (3,4) with body cells at (3,3) and (3,2).

This seems like a better path. Continuing this way:

Move 4: UP → (3,5).
- Insert old head (3,4) into front → [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)].
- Remove tail (3,2). Body is [(3,4), (3,3)].

Similarly, each move up adds to the body length in that column. However, since we need to reach y=9, this would take 5 more moves just on the UP direction from here.

But let's consider that after reaching (3,9), the snake can then move right towards x=6. However, building a long body upwards might block the path if not managed carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps moving diagonally in some way isn't possible since each move is either LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

Another consideration: when the snake eats the apple at (6,9), it will gain a segment, so the body will be longer. Therefore, after eating, there must be at least one free cell adjacent to the new head for movement.

But let's focus on getting to the apple first.

After reaching y=9 via moving UP from x=3:

- That would take 5 more moves: from (3,4) → (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9).

Then, once at (3,9), the next move can be RIGHT to start moving towards x=6.

But let's see:

From (3,9):

- Move RIGHT to (4,9).
- Then continue moving right until reaching (6,9).

However, we need to ensure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with the body except possibly at the tail, which is removed if not eating an apple.

But wait, when approaching (6,9), the snake will have a long body along x=3-5 and y=2-9. So moving right from (3,9) to (4,9), etc., would require careful planning to avoid self-collision.

Alternatively, maybe building the body upwards while also extending it to the right would be better, but I'm not sure.

This seems quite complex. Perhaps a step-by-step approach is needed.

Given the time constraints, I think the minimal number of moves would involve moving left once, then up multiple times, then right multiple times. But calculating the exact number requires tracking each move's effect on the body and ensuring no collisions except at the tail when necessary.

However, since this could take a very long time, perhaps there's a pattern or formula to determine the minimal steps needed.

But considering all of this, I think the answer would involve moving left once, then up 7 times, then right 3 times. That totals 1+7+3=11 moves. However, each move affects the body length and position, so it's not that simple.

Wait, but when you move in a direction, you have to consider whether the new head is adjacent to the old body. For example, moving left from (2,2) takes you to (1,2), which was previously part of the body? No, because after moving left once, the body becomes [(2,2)].

Wait no, initial state: head at (2,2), body [(2,3), (2,4)]. Moving LEFT to (1,2):

- New head: (1,2).
- Insert old head (2,2) into front → body becomes [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)].
- Remove tail (2,4). So new body is [(2,2), (2,3)].

Now, the snake is at (1,2) with body cells at (2,2) and (2,3).

So moving UP from here would take it to (1,3):

Move 2: UP → (1,3).
- Insert old head (1,2) into front of current body [(2,2), (2,3)] → [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)].
- Remove tail (2,3). So new body is [(1,2), (2,2)].

Now, the snake is at (1,3) with body cells at (1,2) and (2,2).

Move 3: UP → (1,4).
- Insert old head (1,3) into front → [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)].
- Remove tail (2,2). Body is [(1,3), (1,2)].

Continuing this way:

Move 4: UP → (1,5).
Body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)].

...

This seems tedious. Maybe a better approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of moves is simply moving left once, then up 7 times, and right 3 times, totaling 11 moves. However, I need to verify if this path would cause any self-collisions.

But considering that each UP move adds a segment above the previous head, which doesn't interfere with the body except for the tail being removed, it should be safe as long as we don't loop back on ourselves.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves is 1 (LEFT) +7 (UP) +3 (RIGHT)=11 moves.
</think>

The snake needs to navigate from its starting position at (2,2) with a body extending down along column x=2. The goal is to reach cell (6,9). Here's the step-by-step path:

1. **Move LEFT** once to get out of the initial body position.
2. **Move UP** seven times to move vertically up to y=9.
3. **Move RIGHT** three times to horizontally reach x=6.

This sequence ensures the snake does not collide with itself and successfully reaches the target in 11 moves.

$\boxed{11}$
