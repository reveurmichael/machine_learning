========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake is at (5,5) and needs to get to the apple at (2,0). Hmm, so that's moving left three times and down five times because 5-0=5. So overall, we need a path that leads the head from (5,5) to (2,0), which requires more downward moves than left.

First, I should check if there are any body segments in the way. The current body list is empty, so no immediate obstacles except maybe future moves where the body might block.

The direction is "NONE", so the first move can be any direction except reversing, but since it's NONE, all are allowed. Let me think about the path.

If I go LEFT three times to get from x=5 to x=2, and then DOWN five times. But wait, after each left, the body will grow or not depending on whether we hit the apple. Oh, right, but initially, the apple is at (2,0), so maybe it's better to move down first?

Wait, let me plot this out.

Starting at (5,5). The apple is at (2,0), which is three steps left and five steps down from the head. So perhaps a path like moving down five times and then left three, but that might be too long. Alternatively, maybe move left first to reduce the x distance while managing y movement.

Wait, another approach: since we need more down moves (5) than left (3), maybe prioritize going down first so that when we eventually go left, the body doesn't block.

But wait, if I start by moving down, each move will take me closer to the apple's y-coordinate. Let's see:

Move 1: DOWN from (5,5) → (5,4). Check for collision: no body parts except the tail might be a problem, but since the body is empty now, it's safe.

After moving down once, body becomes [(5,5)], and head is at (5,4).

Move 2: DOWN again to (5,3). Now, the body after inserting old head would be [old_head], so body is [(5,5), (5,4)], then remove tail? Wait no, because we didn't eat an apple yet. So body becomes [ (5,5) ].

Wait, I'm getting confused about how the body updates. Let's recap: when moving normally, you insert the old head into the body and then remove the tail if not growing. Since in this case, we're not eating any apples, each move shifts the body by adding the previous head and removing the tail.

So after first move down:

Head is (5,4), body was empty before. So after moving down, insert old head (5,5) into body, making body [ (5,5) ], then remove nothing because it's a normal move? Or wait, no: in step 3c, if not eating apple, you remove the last element of body.

Wait, initial state:

Head is at (5,5), body is empty. So after moving down once:

1. new_head = (5,4)
2. No collision because the body is empty.
3. Update body: insert old head (5,5) → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
   Since not eating apple, remove last element of body. But body was just [ (5,5) ], so after removing tail, body is empty again.

So after first move down, body remains empty. Hmm, that's interesting because it means the snake can move freely as long as it doesn't eat apples and thus doesn't grow.

Wait, but in the movement example given, when the snake moves normally (without eating), the body length remains the same. So if initially, the body is empty, after moving down once, the body would still be empty because we added one segment and then removed one.

So for each move without eating an apple, the body doesn't grow, so it can stay empty or have a certain number of segments depending on previous moves.

But in this case, since the initial body is empty, after any non-eating move, the body will remain empty because we add the old head and then remove the tail (which was just added). So essentially, moving without eating apples keeps the snake's body empty, allowing maximum flexibility.

So perhaps a strategy is to move towards the apple while keeping the body as small as possible by not eating any apples until necessary. But wait, in this case, we need to eat the apple at (2,0), so we have to plan the path such that when we reach it, the new head doesn't collide with the body.

Wait, but initially, the body is empty, so moving down and left without worrying about the body until we eat the apple. Once we eat the apple, the body will grow by one segment, which means after eating, the body will have an extra part, and we need to make sure that in the next moves, the head doesn't collide with this new body.

So let's plan a path:

First, move down five times to reach (5,0), then left three times to get to (2,0). But wait, after moving down five times from (5,5) to (5,0), that would be 5 moves. Then, moving left three times to (2,0).

But each move down is allowed as long as direction isn't reversed. Since the initial direction is NONE, first move can be DOWN.

Move 1: DOWN → (5,4)
Move 2: DOWN → (5,3)
Move 3: DOWN → (5,2)
Move 4: DOWN → (5,1)
Move 5: DOWN → (5,0)

Now at (5,0). Next move left to (4,0), then (3,0), then (2,0).

But wait, the apple is at (2,0), so when we reach that point after moving left three times from (5,0):

Move 6: LEFT → (4,0)
Move 7: LEFT → (3,0)
Move 8: LEFT → (2,0)

At move 8, the new head is at (2,0), which is where the apple is. So we eat it.

Now, upon eating the apple:

- Insert old head into body: before this step, after move 7, the head was at (3,0). When moving left to (2,0), the new_head is (2,0) which is the apple's position.

So during movement update:

1. Compute new_head = (2,0)
2. Check collision: since body before this step is empty (we moved without eating apples, so body remains empty), no collision.
3. Update body: insert old head (3,0) into body → body becomes [ (3,0) ]
   Since we ate apple, do not remove tail. So body now has one segment.

So after eating the apple, the snake's body is [(3,0)], and the head is at (2,0).

Now, according to movement rules, after eating, there must be at least one legal move next turn. Let's see what the state is:

- Head: (2,0)
- Body: [ (3,0) ]
- Next direction cannot reverse the current direction. The last move was LEFT, so next can't be RIGHT.

So possible moves from (2,0): UP, DOWN, or LEFT again? Wait no, since previous direction was LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So allowed directions are LEFT, DOWN, or UP.

But let's check each:

UP: y+1 → (2,1). Check collision with body [ (3,0) ]: not occupied, so safe.
DOWN: y-1 would go to (2,-1), which is outside the grid. So invalid.
LEFT: x-1 would be (1,0), which is allowed but check if it's possible.

Wait, but after eating apple, the body includes (3,0). If we move LEFT from (2,0) → (1,0), then new_head is (1,0). The body before shifting is [ (3,0) ]. So collision? No, because (1,0) isn't in the body except possibly if tail is moving. Wait, no: when moving to eat apple, the tail doesn't move because we grow. So after eating, the body includes (3,0), which was added as the new segment.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think step by step.

After eating the apple at (2,0):

- Body before update: [ (3,0) ] from previous moves.
- Insert old head into body → [(3,0)] becomes [ (2,0), (3,0) ]?
Wait no: when you move to (2,0), which is the apple, step 3a says insert the old head (which was at (3,0)) into the front of the BODY list. So after inserting, the body becomes [ (3,0) ], and since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail.

Wait no: initial state before this move:

- Head is at (3,0)
- Body is empty because all previous moves didn't involve eating apples.

When moving LEFT to (2,0):

1. new_head = (2,0)
2. Check collision: body was [ (5,5), ... ]? No, wait initial body is empty. Wait no: after each move without eating, the body remains empty because we add and then remove.

Wait I'm getting stuck on this part. Let's think differently.

Perhaps it's better to plan a path that avoids having the body in the way when approaching the apple.

Another approach: since moving down and left might cause the body to interfere after a few moves, perhaps move directly towards the apple but with minimal body growth.

Alternatively, maybe first move left three times and then down five, but that would require more steps. Hmm.

Wait, let's consider just moving in the order of left three times and then down five. But no, because (2,0) is to the left and down from (5,5). So perhaps a combination.

Alternatively, move diagonally? Wait, can't do that since movement is axis-aligned.

So perhaps the shortest path is to go straight down five and left three, which would take eight moves.

But let's check if any of these steps cause collision. Since initially, body is empty, moving down or left won't create any collisions until we eat the apple.

Wait, but after eating the apple at (2,0), the body becomes [ (3,0) ] because when you move to (2,0), you insert (3,0) into the body. Then, since you ate the apple, you don't remove anything, so body is [ (3,0) ].

Then, next move: from (2,0), possible directions are LEFT, DOWN, or UP (since previous direction was LEFT).

If we go UP to (2,1):

- new_head = (2,1)
- Check collision with body [ (3,0) ] → no.
- Update body: insert old head (2,0) → [ (2,0), (3,0) ]
   Since not eating apple, remove tail. So body becomes [ (2,0) ]

Then next move from (2,1): can't go RIGHT because last direction was UP.

But I think the main point is that after eating the apple, we need to have at least one possible move without collision. So as long as from (2,0), moving in any allowed direction doesn't hit the body, it's fine.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is to approach the apple while keeping the body empty until the last step.

Wait, but when you eat the apple, the body grows by one segment. So perhaps it's manageable.

But maybe I should just outline the moves:

1. DOWN → (5,4)
2. DOWN → (5,3)
3. DOWN → (5,2)
4. DOWN → (5,1)
5. DOWN → (5,0)
6. LEFT → (4,0)
7. LEFT → (3,0)
8. LEFT → (2,0) [EAT APPLE]

At this point, the body is now [ (3,0) ]

Now, next move from (2,0):

Possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT.

If we choose UP:

- Move to (2,1). Body becomes [ (2,0), (3,0) ] after inserting old head. Then remove tail → body is [ (2,0) ]
   From (2,1), possible moves without reversing.

Alternatively, if we move DOWN from (2,0), it's invalid as y would be -1.

If we move LEFT again to (1,0):

- new_head = (1,0)
- Check collision with body [ (3,0) ] → no.
- Insert old head (2,0) → body becomes [ (2,0), (3,0) ]
   Since not eating apple, remove tail → body is [ (2,0) ]

But from (1,0), next move can't be RIGHT because last was LEFT.

So either way, after eating the apple, there's at least one possible move. So the path seems acceptable.

Therefore, the sequence of moves would be:

DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT.

That's eight moves in total.

I think this should work because each step doesn't cause collision with an empty body until the last step when we eat the apple, and after that, there are still possible moves.
</think>

The optimal path to reach the apple from (5,5) to (2,0) without causing self-collisions is a series of downward moves followed by leftward moves. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake's head starts at (5,5), and the body is empty.
2. **Move Down 5 Times:**
   - Move 1: DOWN to (5,4)
   - Move 2: DOWN to (5,3)
   - Move 3: DOWN to (5,2)
   - Move 4: DOWN to (5,1)
   - Move 5: DOWN to (5,0)
   - After each move, the body remains empty because no apples are eaten.
3. **Move Left 3 Times:**
   - Move 6: LEFT to (4,0)
   - Move 7: LEFT to (3,0)
   - Move 8: LEFT to (2,0) [Eats the apple]
   - Upon eating the apple at (2,0), the body now includes the segment from (3,0).
4. **Post-Apple Check:** After eating, ensure there's a valid next move without collision.

**Answer:**

The snake should make five downward moves followed by three leftward moves. The sequence is:

DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT.

So the final answer is:

\boxed{D D D D D L L L}

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (2, 0). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
