 {
    "moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT"],
    "reasoning": "The snake starts at (8,2). To reach the apple at (2,1), we move 'UP' to get closer to the apple horizontally. Since we cannot reverse direction on the first move, we then move 'LEFT' three times, staying within bounds and not colliding with walls or body segments. Finally, we move 'DOWN' to reach the apple."
