check the logs in   , its game_N.json and summary.json and the console output to see if everything is great. What else code should we modify? just answer the question, no need to modify the code.


We’re much closer—most of the per-game numbers in the two new log files are internally consistent and the high-level totals in `summary.json` (score, steps, time, token usage) now add up correctly.  The places that are still off are confined to the global aggregation layer and a few edge counters:

1. `summary.json › step_stats`  
   • `valid_steps` is 0 (should be 60 = 12 + 48).  
   • `empty_steps` is 2 (should be 1 – only Game 1 had one empty step).  
   • `invalid_reversals` is 0 (should be 1, from Game 2 round 6).

   This mirrors the console footer where it prints  
   ```
   Valid Steps: 0
   Empty Steps: 2
   Invalid Reversals: 0
   ```
   so the bug is in the aggregator, not the JSON dump.



4. Small casing / sentinel issues  
   • One move in Game 2’s `moves` list is literally `"INVALID_REVERSAL"`; everywhere else you store the reversal separately in `invalid_reversals`.  Either drop that string from the move log or normalise it to keep the list pure.  
   • No more lowercase `"right"` occurrences—good!


remove the entry :  game_N.json -> detaailed_history -> rounds_data -> round_N -> invalid_reversals  . Remove the entry from the summary.json as well. But keep the invalid_reversal related stats (counting, or maybe percentage if it's present)


now the same should go for the "EMPTY" and "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" steps. Yes, we should have "EMPTY" and "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" moves, which should be recorded in the "moves" list. But it will not move the snake head. EMPTY comes from LLM message with {"moves":[], reason: "blablabla"} and ERROR comes from LLM message with {"moves":[], reason: "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG"}. We have already such related code in 


we have the code in parsing_utils.py:

            # If we didn't get moves, check if reasoning contains "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG"
            if (
                json_data
                and "reasoning" in json_data
                and "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" in json_data["reasoning"]
            ):
                # This is an explicit error state from the LLM
                print("LLM reported an SOMETHING_IS_WRONG state")
                game_instance.game_state.record_something_is_wrong_move()
                return None

            # No valid moves, return None (empty move)
            return None

Make sure the replay mode will work with the "EMPTY" and "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" moves (snake will not move). check replay_engine.py .
