{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (3, 6) and moves up to expand its body in a new y-coordinate area. Then it moves right five times sequentially to reach x-coordinates 4, 5, 6, 7, and finally 8 at each step. After reaching (8, 7), the snake makes one more right move to extend the body into the x-coordinate 9 at position (9, 7). Finally, the snake moves down six times sequentially through y-coordinates 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and finally 1."}
