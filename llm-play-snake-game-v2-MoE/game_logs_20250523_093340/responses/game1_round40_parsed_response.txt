{"moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (6, 1) and needs to reach the apple at (0, 1). Since it cannot move left first due to its current direction, we will move down to avoid the snake's body. After moving repeatedly left, we reach (0, 0), which is not in the snake's body. Finally, we move up to eat the apple."}
