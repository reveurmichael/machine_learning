========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the current game state to determine the safest path for the snake to reach the apple at (1, 1) from its head position at (7, 1), while following all movement rules and constraints.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Current State:
- Head Position: (7, 1)
- Current Direction: RIGHT
- Body Cells: [(6, 2), (6, 1)]
- Apple Position: (1, 1)

### Analysis:
To move from (7, 1) to (1, 1):
1. We need to move LEFT a total of 6 times (7 - 1 = 6)
2. No vertical movement is needed since both y-coordinates are the same.

Since the snake's current direction is RIGHT and it cannot reverse directly into LEFT, we must plan carefully:

### Movement Planning:
- Start by moving UP or DOWN to avoid immediate reversal.
- Then move LEFT repeatedly until reaching the apple position (1, 1).

Given that both head and body cells are on the same y-coordinate line (y=1), moving UP or DOWN slightly can help avoid a direct reversal:

Let's plan a path:
1. Move UP once
2. Move DOWN once to come back to y=1
3. Move LEFT repeatedly 6 times

This path ensures that we don't immediately reverse direction and safely reach the apple.

### Path Details:
- Moves: ["UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"]

### Reasoning:
The plan is to initially move UP and then DOWN, avoiding a direct reversal of direction. After that, we can safely continue moving LEFT to reach the apple at (1, 1).

Let's return this as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Move UP and then DOWN to avoid direct reversal. Continue moving LEFT until reaching the apple at (1, 1)."
}
```
