<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to start by understanding all the given information and then plan a safe path for the snake's head from (9,7) to (4,0).

First, the initial state of the snake:
- Head is at (9,7).
- The current direction is "UP".
- The body cells are [(9,6)], meaning the tail is at (9,6), and the next segment after the head is also at (9,6). So the snake's length is 2.

The apple is located at (4,0).

I need to move the head towards the apple without colliding with any walls or body segments. The key here is to plan a path that avoids these obstacles and keeps the snake's body continuous after each move.

Looking at the position of the head, it's in the bottom-right corner (since x=9 is the maximum). The apple is way to the left and upwards from there. So moving directly up might not be feasible due to potential collisions with walls or other parts of the body.

Let me think about possible directions:
- If I move UP, the head would go to (9,8), but that's still close to the top-right corner. However, the apple is at (4,0), so moving right and up might be necessary.
- Moving LEFT from (9,7) would take us towards x=8, which isn't directly helpful for reaching (4,0). But combining LEFT with UP or DOWN could work.

Wait, I need to consider that after each move, the snake's body must remain continuous. So moving in a straight line might cause parts of the body to block itself. Maybe making some turns is necessary to navigate around any potential obstacles.

Given the current direction is "UP", but according to the movement rules, we can't reverse immediately on the first move if it's allowed. Wait, no—after each move, the direction can change as long as we don't reverse from UP to DOWN or vice versa unless they are consecutive moves after a turn. Hmm, maybe that rule doesn't apply here since the initial direction is UP.

Wait, actually, the rules say: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if I'm moving UP first, then in subsequent moves, I can't move DOWN immediately. But wait, that rule might apply after each move.

Wait no—the rules specify: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed.

So since the initial direction is UP, in the next move, we can't go DOWN. Hmm, but that might complicate things because moving towards the apple requires going left and up or down? Wait, no—the apple is at (4,0), which is much lower than (9,7). So to reach it, I need to move left significantly.

But if I start by moving LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7), that might be a better initial step because it reduces the x-coordinate towards 4. Let me see:

Move LEFT: new head would be (8,7). Now, check for collisions. The current body is at (9,6). So inserting the old head into the body list before any shifts.

So after moving LEFT:
- New head is (8,7).
- The body segments become [(9,6), (9,5)]? Wait no—original body cells are [(9,6)]. After moving LEFT and adding to the front of the body, it becomes [(8,7), (9,6)]. Then, since we're not eating an apple in this move, we remove the last segment. So the new body is just [(8,7)].

Wait no—actually, when you add the head at the front and then decide to remove the tail if necessary. In this case, it's not eating an apple, so after adding (8,7) as the new head, we insert old_head = (9,6) into the front of the body list, making it [(9,6), ...], but wait no—the initial body is [(9,6)], and when moving LEFT:

1. Compute new_head: (8,7)
2. Check for collision with any BODYi except the tail's current cell if growing.
   - Current body is [(9,6)]. So (8,7) isn't in this list, so no collision.
3. Update body:
   a. Insert old_head (9,6) at front → new body before removing tail: [(9,6), ...]? Wait, original body was [(9,6)], but after adding the head to the front, it becomes [(8,7)] followed by the old body segments? Or wait, let me re-examine.

Wait no—the movement update rule says:
a. Insert the old head at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1).
So if the original body was [(9,6)], after inserting (9,6) as the new HEAD's position before any shifts, then we add it to the front: [ (8,7), (9,6) ]? No—that can't be because that would make the body segments from behind. Wait no—no—the insertion happens regardless of whether they are moving.

Wait actually, when you compute new_head and determine there's no collision:

a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1). So if the current body is [(9,6)], then inserting (8,7) as the new head would make the new body list start with (8,7), followed by the original body segments.

But wait, in step 3a: we take the old head position and insert it at the front of the BODY list. So if the current body is [B1, B2], then after inserting the new head H, it becomes [H, B1, B2]. Then, since this is not an apple-eating move (we're just moving), we remove the tail.

Wait no—the movement update says:
c. If not eating apple: remove last element of BODY so total length remains same as before.

So in our case:

After inserting new_head at front, body becomes [new_head] + old_body list → but since it's a list of segments behind the head, which is followed by B1 (immediately behind), etc. Wait no—initially, the body is [(9,6)], so after moving LEFT and not eating apple:

- new_head = (8,7)
- insert into front: [new_head] + current_body → [(8,7), (9,6)]
- then remove last element because it's not an apple move → becomes [(8,7)]

Wait no—that can't be right. Because inserting the old head position as the new head would mean that the body list is [head, previous head, ...]. Wait I think I need to clarify:

The movement update rule says:
1. Compute new_head.
2. Check for collision.
3. a) Insert old_head at front of BODY → new_body = [old_head] + body
4. b) If eating apple: do not remove tail; else, remove last element.

So in this case, the initial body is [(9,6)].

After step 3a, the new_body becomes [ (8,7), (9,6) ] because we inserted old_head at front of current_body. Then, since it's not an apple move, we need to remove the last element: so after removing, the body list is [(8,7)].

So now, the snake has head at (8,7) and no body segments? Or does it have a single segment which is the new head?

Wait according to rule 2d: "Body cells exclude the head." So the body consists of all except the head. So in this case, after moving LEFT:

new_head = (8,7)
body becomes [(9,6)] → insert old_head at front ⇒ [ (8,7), (9,6) ]
then remove last element if not eating apple: new_body is [ (8,7) ]

Wait that can't be right because the body cells are supposed to have one less segment than the head. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when you insert the old_head at front of the current body list and then remove the last element for non-apple moves:

So if current body is [(9,6)], after inserting new_head (8,7) at front: [ (8,7), (9,6) ]

Then since it's a non-apple move, we remove last element → resulting in [(8,7)]

But that would mean the snake has only one segment, which is its head. But according to rule 2d: Body cells exclude the head. So the body can't have any segments if the snake is length 1.

Wait this seems conflicting. Because after moving, the new head is (8,7) and the body is [(9,6)], then inserting at front gives [ (8,7), (9,6) ], but since it's a non-apple move, we remove last → so the body becomes empty? Or does that mean the snake has only the head?

This seems like an edge case. Maybe in this scenario, after moving LEFT and not eating apple, the body is just [(8,7)], which would be length 1—so no body segments.

But then, when we try to compute new_head again, will it have a valid body? Wait let's proceed step by step.

So head moves from (9,7) to (8,7). The initial body was [(9,6)]. Inserting (8,7) at front makes the new body [ (8,7), (9,6) ]. Since we're not eating an apple, we remove last element → now it's [ (8,7) ].

Wait that would mean after this move, the snake is just a single head with no body. But according to rule 2d: "Body cells exclude the head." So maybe the snake can't have a body of length zero unless it's length one? Wait that makes sense because if the snake is only one segment (head), its body has zero.

So perhaps after this move, the snake is now [(8,7)], with no body. Then, when moving again, we don't need to worry about any body segments colliding.

This seems like a possible scenario.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the process of inserting and removing.

Perhaps it's better to model each step in detail:

Current state:
- Head: (9,7)
- Body: [(9,6)]
- Direction: UP
- Apple position: (4,0)

Move LEFT first move:

1. Compute new_head = (8,7).

2. Check collision with any current body segments except the tail if growing.

   Since not eating apple, no growth. So check if new_head is in body? Current body is [(9,6)], so 8,7 isn't there → safe.

3. Update body:

   a) Insert old head (which was (9,6)) at front of current body: new_body_before = [ (9,6), ... ] Wait no—wait the current body is [(9,6)]. So after inserting, it's [ (8,7), (9,6) ]

Wait but then step 3a says insert old head into the body list to make the new body before any shifts. Then in step 3b and c:

If not eating apple: remove last element of new_body_before → so [ (8,7) ]

Thus, after moving LEFT once, the snake's position is:

- Head at (8,7)
- Body cells: []
Because we removed the last segment.

Wait but that can't be correct because then when you move again, you have a head and no body. So next move could only be in certain directions without causing collision with walls or previous positions.

But perhaps moving LEFT is okay for now to get closer to x=4.

Alternatively, maybe instead of moving left first, I should consider other options.

Wait the current direction is UP, which takes us towards (9,8), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if we turn right from UP, i.e., change direction to RIGHT?

But wait according to rule: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

Wait no—the rules say:
- Cannot reverse: If the current direction is UP, cannot choose DOWN next.
   But in terms of movement steps, we're allowed to change direction as long as it's not directly reversing. So from UP, can I move LEFT or RIGHT?

Yes. For example, moving LEFT after being UP is allowed because they are not opposites (DOWN and UP are opposites). Similarly, from UP, you can turn left into LEFT.

So perhaps turning LEFT first would help us reduce the x-coordinate towards 4, which is necessary to reach (4,0).

But in our initial step, when moving LEFT, we saw that it reduces x but leaves y at 7. So maybe after that move, I can continue moving LEFT or change direction accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps a different approach: planning a path from (9,7) to (4,0), considering the minimal steps and avoiding walls.

The Manhattan distance is |9-4| + |7-0| = 5 +7=12. But that's without obstacles. Since there are no other body parts yet except for the tail at (9,6), which isn't an issue unless it blocks us.

Wait wait—the initial body is [(9,6)], so the snake's head is at (9,7). So between (9,7) and (9,6), that's just one segment. So when moving from (9,7) to (8,7), then we have a new body of [ (8,7) ].

Wait no—if you insert the old head into front and then remove last element for non-apple move, it becomes [(8,7)], which is length 1—so that's acceptable because it means only one segment: the head. So the body cells are empty.

So moving left once to (8,7), with no body segments, seems safe.

Next move:

Current state:
- Head at (8,7)
- Body: []
- Direction was LEFT
- Current position relative to apple is still far

But now that there's no body, I can change direction freely as long as it doesn't reverse from the previous direction. Wait but since we changed direction after a move, we need to consider what the new direction will be.

Wait in this case, our first move was LEFT, so next moves cannot include RIGHT if we're moving straight. Hmm, no—wait when you turn, your current direction changes.

But perhaps I'm complicating things too much.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of the snake as a linked list where each segment follows the previous one. So after moving LEFT once, we have:

- Head: (8,7)
- Body: [(9,6)] → but wait no—after step 3a in movement update, when you insert old_head into front and then remove last element because it's not apple move.

Wait this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Alternative plan:

Since the snake has to move from (9,7) towards (4,0), which requires moving left 5 times and down 7 times in some combination. But given that each move can only change direction if allowed by the rules, perhaps planning a path with minimal turns is necessary.

But considering that we are just starting out without any body segments except for the tail at (9,6), maybe it's possible to navigate directly towards the apple while avoiding walls and self-collisions.

Wait another point: after moving left once to (8,7) and having no body, perhaps I can now move DOWN as allowed. Because from direction LEFT, can we change direction to DOWN? According to rules:

- Cannot reverse if current direction is UP, cannot choose DOWN next.
But in this case, the previous direction was LEFT. So it's okay to turn DOWN or RIGHT.

Yes—so after moving LEFT once (direction: LEFT), next move can be any except RIGHT.

So from (8,7), with no body segments, I can change direction to DOWN, for example.

Move DOWN:

- New head would be (8,6)
- Current body is empty → so inserting new_head at front and not growing
- Since it's a non-apple move, remove last element of new_body_before—but since there are no elements, nothing changes

So after this move:
- Head: (8,6)
- Body: []
- Direction now DOWN.

Now the snake can continue moving DOWN as long as it doesn't hit walls or collide with itself.

Wait but moving from (8,7) to (8,6), which is a step towards y=0. However, since the apple is at (4,0), maybe after several moves, we need to start turning LEFT again to reach x=4.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to keep moving DOWN until we are close enough to turn right and then move left towards the apple.

But wait, from (8,6) moving DOWN would take us to (8,5). Let me see if that helps:

Move DOWN again:
- New head: (8,5)
- No body → same as above
- Direction remains DOWN

Proceeding this way until y=0. But since the apple is at x=4, perhaps once we are near enough in x-direction, turning right and moving left.

Alternatively, maybe combining moves—e.g., move down a few times then turn right to move left towards x=4.

But wait from (8,6), if I change direction to RIGHT after several DOWN moves, would that be allowed?

Yes. From current direction DOWN, since we can't reverse, but changing direction to RIGHT is allowed as they are not opposites.

So let me try this plan:

1. Move LEFT once: head at (8,7)
2. Move DOWN until y=0
   - Each move down takes us closer to the apple
3. Once near enough in x-direction, turn RIGHT and move left towards x=4

But wait from (8,6), moving DOWN would take us further away in x? No—x is still 8, so we're moving from y=7 to y=0.

Wait no—if I'm at (8,6) and move DOWN again to (8,5), then to (8,4), etc., until reaching (8,0). But the apple is at x=4. So after that, perhaps turning RIGHT would allow moving left towards 4.

But let me check:

From (8,7):
- Move LEFT → (8,7) becomes head, body empty
- Then move DOWN repeatedly:
   - (8,6), then (8,5), etc., until y=0

Once at y=0 and x=8, if I turn RIGHT, my direction changes to RIGHT. But wait current direction is DOWN.

Wait no—direction after moving LEFT once was LEFT. Then changing to DOWN for several moves would keep the snake moving DOWN with each move.

But perhaps that's not efficient in terms of reaching (4,0).

Alternatively, maybe from (8,7), instead of moving left once and then down, I can find a more direct path.

Wait another idea: Maybe turning RIGHT early on could help reduce x faster. Let me try:

1. Current position: (9,7)
   - Direction: UP
2. Change direction to RIGHT after first move? But from current direction UP, right is allowed because it's not the reverse.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps a different approach—modeling each possible step as per rules and checking for validity.

Given that this might take too long manually, maybe I can think of the minimal steps required:

From (9,7) to (4,0), with necessary lefts and downs. Let's say we need 5 left moves and 7 down moves—so total 12 moves if no obstacles. But since the snake has a body that blocks itself.

But wait in this scenario, after first move LEFT, the body is empty, so no collision risk except walls.

So maybe plan is:

Move LEFT once to (8,7)
Then move DOWN as much as possible without hitting walls
Once at x=4, continue moving DOWN

Wait but how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that after first left and some downs, turn right when x reaches 4, then proceed down.

But need to plan step by step:

1. Move LEFT once: (8,7), body empty
2. Direction is now LEFT, so next moves can't be RIGHT
3. Next move could be DOWN:
   - New head: (8,6)
   - Since no body, safe
4. Continue moving DOWN until y=0 → but that's only one direction.
But apple at x=4, so maybe need to turn right once we are in a position.

Wait perhaps:

1. Move LEFT once: (8,7), no body
2. Turn RIGHT now, changing direction from LEFT to RIGHT—allowed because it's not the opposite of previous (which was LEFT)
   - Wait but current direction is LEFT, can't reverse to UP or DOWN? No—the rule says you can only reverse if directly opposing.

Wait rules say: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, cannot choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So from direction LEFT, the opposite would be RIGHT. So changing from LEFT to RIGHT is allowed—no problem.

Therefore:

After step 1 (move left to (8,7)), change direction to RIGHT:
- Now facing right
- Next move can't be LEFT

Wait no—the rules don't restrict changing directions as long as it's not directly reversing. So you can turn any other way except direct reversal.

So from LEFT, can turn UP, DOWN, or RIGHT—no problem.

Therefore:

1. Move LEFT once: head (8,7), direction LEFT
2. Change direction to RIGHT → allowed
3. Next move is RIGHT:
   - New head would be (9,7)
   - But current body is empty, so check for collision with body? There's no body except the new head.
   - So moving back to (9,7) is possible?

But that might not be useful because we're going in a circle.

Alternatively:

After step 1: head at (8,7), direction LEFT
Change direction to RIGHT after first move → so now facing RIGHT
Then next moves must follow the rules of movement—i.e., can't reverse again

Wait this is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to proceed with a plan.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of Manhattan distance and see if minimal steps are feasible without self-collisions.

But considering that after moving left once, snake is at (8,7) with no body—so from there, can move down 5 times to reach y=2, then turn right into x direction towards the apple. But need to calculate:

From (8,7), moving down until y=0 would take several steps.

Wait let's see: From y=7 to y=0 is 7 steps downward.

If we can safely move all the way down without any body parts getting in the way—since there are no body segments except head—then after reaching (8,0), turning right into x direction towards apple at (4,0). That would require moving left from x=8 to x=4: 4 steps.

Total moves:

Left once + Down seven times + Right once + Left four times = 1+7+1+4=13 moves. But need to check for wall collisions and self-collisions during this process.

Wait but are there any walls in the path? The snake is moving from x=9, y=7 towards lower x and down y.

So:

Moving left once: (8,7) → no wall collision
Then seven downs:
- From (8,7) to (8,6), ..., (8,0)
   Each step is valid as long as within grid.
Assuming grid is sufficiently large, which it likely is in the game.

After that, turning right from facing left? No—after moving down, direction would be DOWN until y=0. Then turning right would change direction to RIGHT.

Wait after moving down seven times, current position: (8,0), facing DOWN.

To turn right from direction DOWN would face LEFT.

But wait in terms of movement:

From (8,0) facing DOWN:
- Next move can't be UP if previous was DOWN. Wait no—the rule is about reversing directions.

Wait rules say you cannot reverse, i.e., go back the way you came.

So moving DOWN after being DOWN—allowed as long as not directly reversed.

But in terms of direction changes: From DOWN, turning LEFT would face RIGHT?

No—I think it's better to use coordinate system:

Facing DOWN is along negative y-axis. Turning right from facing DOWN (south) would be towards WEST (negative x).

So change of direction from DOWN to WEST—allowed as they are not opposites.

Therefore, after moving down seven times to (8,0), turning right to face west.

Then move left four times:

From (8,0):
- Move LEFT once → (7,0)
   - No body collision
- Move LEFT again → (6,0)
   - No problem
- Repeat until x=4

So total moves:

1. Left once: (9,7) → (8,7)
2. Down seven times: (8,7) → ... → (8,0)
3. Right once: facing west from (8,0)
4. Left four times: (8,0) → (4,0)

Total moves: 1+7+1+4=13.

But in this plan, during step 2, the snake is moving down while its body remains empty after first move left. So it's safe from self-collisions except for the head.

So seems feasible.

Alternative check:

When at (8,6), if we continue moving DOWN to (8,5), etc., no issues.

Wait but when moving towards y=0, there could be a time when x approaches 4—would that cause any issues?

No—if all moves are planned correctly without self-collisions.

Therefore, this seems like a feasible path:

1. Move LEFT once: (9,7) → (8,7)
2. Move DOWN seven times to reach (8,0)
3. Turn RIGHT, then move LEFT four times to reach (4,0)

But let me check if turning right at (8,0) is allowed.

Current direction before moving down was DOWN; after moving down seven times and being at (8,0), current position with direction facing DOWN? Or after the last move, what's the new direction?

Wait each move in a certain direction changes the head but doesn't change the body segments. So if we're always moving in the same direction without turning, our direction remains the same.

But no—actually, when you make multiple moves in the same direction, your body extends along that path, so facing direction is maintained.

Wait I think my understanding was incorrect. Each move changes both head and direction—if not turning, direction remains same.

So after moving down seven times, snake's head would be at (8,0), with direction DOWN.

But when it turns right once from direction DOWN to face west (left along x-axis), that change is allowed as per rules—since you're changing from DOWN to RIGHT or LEFT, which are not direct reverses.

Therefore, plan seems feasible.

So final step-by-step moves:

1. Move LEFT: (9,7) → (8,7)
2. Move DOWN seven times:
   - Each move from y=6 down to 0
3. Turn RIGHT (from facing DOWN), now facing WEST
4. Move LEFT four times:
   - From x=8 to 4

Thus total steps: 1 + 7 + 1 +4 = 13.

But I need to verify that in each step, the snake doesn't collide with itself or walls.

Wait when moving down from (8,7), after first move left and then down—no body segments except head. So safe.

When at (8,0) facing DOWN, turning RIGHT to face west: allowed as per rules.

Then moving LEFT four times on x=8, y=0:

- Each step is along negative x-axis towards 4. No collision with body or walls since y remains 0 and x decreases.

Therefore, it seems possible.

Thus, the minimal number of steps is 13, following this path.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple by moving left once, then down seven times, turning right to face west, and finally moving left four more times. This sequence ensures no collisions with walls or self-collisions while efficiently guiding the snake towards the target.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake is at (9,7) facing UP.
2. **Move LEFT once:** Snake moves to (8,7). Direction remains LEFT.
3. **Move DOWN seven times:**
   - From (8,7) → (8,6)
   - Then (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0).
4. **Turn RIGHT:** Now facing WEST.
5. **Move LEFT four times:**
   - From (8,0) → (7,0)
   - Then (6,0), (5,0), (4,0).

This plan ensures the snake navigates from its starting position to the apple's location without any obstructions or self-collisions.

**Answer:** The snake can reach the apple with a sequence of moves: 1 left, 7 downs, turn right, and 4 more lefts.

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (9, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(9, 6)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (4, 0). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
