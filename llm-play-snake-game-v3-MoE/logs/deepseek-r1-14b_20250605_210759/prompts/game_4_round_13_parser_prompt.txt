========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (7,4) to eat the apple at (0,1). The current direction is DOWN, so first, I can't reverse and go UP. I need to plan a path that avoids collisions with the body and walls.

Looking at the body cells: [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]. So the snake is extending from the head (7,4) down and to the right. The tail is at (3,2).

The apple is at (0,1), which is way on the left side near the bottom-left corner. From (7,4), I need to move left multiple times, but also maybe up or down a bit to navigate around the body.

First, since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. So possible initial moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But moving RIGHT from (7,4) would take me to (8,4), which is part of the body. That's dangerous because if I move there, it's a collision with BODYi except maybe the tail.

So moving right is not safe. Moving left from (7,4) takes me to (6,4). Is that position clear? Let's check the body. The body starts at (7,5), then (8,5), etc., so (6,4) isn't in the body. That seems okay.

Wait, but after moving, the body will shift. So inserting the old head into the body and possibly removing the tail if not growing. Since I'm moving towards an apple that's far away, initially, I might not be eating it right away, so the body length remains the same unless I reach the apple.

So first move is LEFT to (6,4). That should be safe because (6,4) isn't in the current body list except maybe after the movement. Wait, after moving, the new head is (6,4), and then the old head (7,4) becomes part of the body. So before the move, the body doesn't include (6,4). But after the move, it does.

So the collision check is based on the state before body shifts. So when moving to (6,4), we need to make sure that in the initial state, none of the body parts except possibly the tail's next position is at (6,4).

In the initial state, the body doesn't include (6,4). The tail is at (3,2), and it won't move this turn unless I eat an apple. Since (6,4) is not part of the current body, moving there is safe.

So first move: LEFT to (6,4).

Next, from (6,4), what's possible? Current direction after first move would be LEFT, so next moves can't go RIGHT. So options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But I need to consider where the body will be. After moving left once, the body becomes [ (7,4), (7,5), ... , (3,2) ] and then we remove the tail if not growing. Since we aren't eating apple yet, so body length remains same.

Wait, no: initial body is 10 segments, so after moving without eating, it's still 10. So inserting old head makes it 11, but removing the tail brings back to 10.

So from (6,4), next move options:

Option 1: Move LEFT again to (5,4). Check if that position is safe. In current body after first move, the new body starts with (7,4) inserted at front. So body is [(7,4), (7,5), (8,5), ..., (3,2)]. The tail will be removed unless we eat an apple.

So (5,4) isn't in the current body, so safe to move there.

But let's see: after moving from (6,4) to (5,4), is that a collision? Before movement, body doesn't include (5,4). So yes, it's safe. Next direction would be LEFT again.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider turning up or down to avoid the body in case it gets too long.

Wait, let me think about the path. The apple is at (0,1), which is quite a bit left and slightly up from current head position (7,4). So I need to move left multiple times, but maybe also adjust y-coordinate to get around any blockages.

But initially, moving LEFT seems straightforward. Let's proceed step by step.

First move: LEFT to (6,4).

Second move: From (6,4), possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

If I go LEFT again to (5,4), that's further towards the apple. But let me check if any body parts might interfere in future steps.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP first from (7,4) would be better, but current direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP. Wait no: initial direction is DOWN, but after the first move, the direction will change to LEFT. So for the second move, any direction except RIGHT is allowed because I'm now going LEFT.

Wait, movement rule says you can't reverse direction immediately. But since after moving LEFT from DOWN, the next direction just needs not to be RIGHT (since current direction would become LEFT). Wait no: the rules say that if the current direction is "LEFT", then next move cannot be "RIGHT". So in this case, after first move, direction is LEFT, so next moves can't be RIGHT.

So from (6,4), possible directions are LEFT, UP, DOWN, but not RIGHT.

But I need to plan a path that leads towards (0,1). Let's consider moving left again as the shortest path. So:

Second move: LEFT to (5,4).

Now head is at (5,4). The body has shifted accordingly.

Third move: Again, can't go RIGHT, so options are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving LEFT to (4,4) seems logical.

Fourth move: LEFT to (3,4).

Fifth move: LEFT to (2,4).

Sixth move: LEFT to (1,4).

Seventh move: LEFT to (0,4). Now head is at (0,4), one row above the apple's position. To get to (0,1), I need to go DOWN three times.

But wait, let me check if moving down from (0,4) would cause any collisions with body parts.

At each step, I need to ensure that when moving, the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail's next position.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to adjust direction earlier to go down while still in a position where the body isn't blocking.

But perhaps another approach: from (7,4), instead of going all the way left, move up first to avoid some body parts. Let me think.

Wait, current head is at (7,4). The body behind it starts at (7,5), which is above the head. So if I go LEFT, that's clear, but moving UP might lead towards the body part at (7,5).

If I try to move UP first: new head would be (7,5). But checking collision: is (7,5) in the body? Yes, because the next body cell is (7,5). So moving up here would cause a collision with BODY1, which is not allowed unless it's the tail. Since the tail is at (3,2), this is not the case.

So moving UP from (7,4) isn't safe. Therefore, initial move can't be UP.

Similarly, moving DOWN: new head would be (7,3). Let's check if that's a collision. The body starts at (7,5), so in the current state before movement, (7,3) is not part of the body. So moving DOWN to (7,3) is safe? Wait, but after the move, the old head (7,4) becomes part of the body.

Wait no: collision check is based on pre-shift body positions. So when moving from (7,4), if direction is DOWN, new head is (7,3). Before shifting, does any BODYi equal to (7,3)? The current body starts at (7,5), so no. Therefore, it's safe.

Wait, but the initial direction is DOWN. Can I change direction? Yes, because current direction is DOWN, and next move can't be UP. Wait, no: according to movement rules, you cannot reverse direction immediately. Current direction is DOWN; next move can't be UP. So from (7,4), if first move is DOWN to (7,3), that's allowed.

But then, the body will shift accordingly. Let me see:

After moving down, head is at (7,3). Then the body becomes [ (7,4) ] + rest of the body cells. So the new body list is [ (7,4), (8,5), (8,4), ... , (3,2) ]. The tail will be removed unless we ate an apple.

But I'm not eating the apple yet because it's at (0,1). So the body remains length 10. So now head is at (7,3).

Next move from (7,3): can't go UP, since current direction is DOWN; next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But moving right to (8,3) would take me to a position that's in the body? Let's see: after first move down, the body includes (8,4), etc., but not (8,3). So perhaps it's safe. Wait no: before movement, the body doesn't include (8,3). So moving right is possible.

But I'm trying to reach (0,1), which is left and up, so maybe moving left would be better.

Alternatively, from (7,3), move LEFT to (6,3).

Is that safe? Before movement, the body doesn't include (6,3). So yes, it's safe.

This seems like a viable path. But I need to check if continuing in this manner will eventually lead me to the apple without hitting any body parts.

But perhaps moving down initially could lead to more complications as the body may block certain paths later on.

Alternatively, sticking with the initial plan of moving left seems safer because it's directly towards the apple.

So back to that: first move LEFT to (6,4). Then continue moving left until reaching (0,4), then move down three times.

But let me check each step for safety:

1. Move LEFT from (7,4) to (6,4): safe.
2. Move LEFT from (6,4) to (5,4): safe.
3. Move LEFT from (5,4) to (4,4): safe.
4. Move LEFT from (4,4) to (3,4): safe.
5. Move LEFT from (3,4) to (2,4): safe.
6. Move LEFT from (2,4) to (1,4): safe.
7. Move LEFT from (1,4) to (0,4): safe.

Now at (0,4), need to go down three times:

8. Move DOWN to (0,3).
9. Move DOWN to (0,2).
10. Move DOWN to (0,1).

But wait, when moving down from (0,4) to (0,3), is that position safe? Let's check.

At step 7, the head is at (0,4). The body after these movements would have shifted each time. So when moving down to (0,3), before shifting, does any BODYi equal (0,3)? Probably not because the body is trailing behind.

But I'm not sure if during these steps the body could block the way. For example, after several moves left, the body may extend towards the positions we're trying to move into.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to adjust direction earlier to go down and then left.

Wait, maybe another approach: instead of moving all the way left first, move up a bit to avoid any potential blockage from the body as I proceed.

But wait, when starting at (7,4), moving up isn't possible because that would take me to (7,5), which is part of the body. So collision occurs, so can't do that.

Therefore, initial moves have to be either LEFT or DOWN.

If I choose to move down first:

1. Move DOWN from (7,4) to (7,3): safe.
2. Now at (7,3). Next move options: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (can't go UP).

If I then move LEFT to (6,3):

3. Move LEFT to (6,3).
4. Move LEFT to (5,3).
5. And so on until reaching (0,3), then move down to (0,1). But wait, the apple is at (0,1), which is two steps below (0,3).

But perhaps this path would require moving further left and then down.

Hmm, both paths seem possible but need to check for body collisions as they extend.

Alternatively, maybe a combination of left and up or down movements could be more efficient. But without knowing how the body will shift each time, it's tricky.

Given the complexity, perhaps sticking with the initial plan of moving left first is safer since it directly targets the apple's column (x=0).

So to summarize:

1. Move LEFT from (7,4) to (6,4).
2. Move LEFT to (5,4).
3. Continue until (0,4), then move DOWN three times.

I think this should work as long as none of those positions are occupied by the body during their respective steps. Since each movement is only adding the old head to the body and removing the tail, as long as we don't step into a position that was part of the body before our current move, it's safe.

The snake needs to navigate from (7,4) to (0,1) without colliding with its own body. By moving left sequentially and then down, avoiding immediate collisions with the body, the following moves are determined.

```json
{
  "moves": [
    "LEFT",
    "LEFT",
    "LEFT",
    "LEFT",
    "LEFT",
    "LEFT",
    "LEFT",
    "DOWN",
    "DOWN",
    "DOWN"
  ]
}
```
```

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (0, 1). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
