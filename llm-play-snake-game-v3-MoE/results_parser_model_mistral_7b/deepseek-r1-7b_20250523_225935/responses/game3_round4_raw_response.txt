========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out a path for the snake's head from (5,2) to (7,7). The snake is currently moving DOWN, and its body includes (5,3). The apple is at (7,7). 

First, let me visualize where everything is. The snake's head is at (5,2), which is in the middle of the grid on the lower side since y increases upwards. Its next segment is (5,3), so it's heading down initially. But wait, no—the direction is DOWN, so from (5,2), moving down would actually take it to (5,1) because y decreases as you go down in this coordinate system.

Wait, hold on. The snake's current head position is (5,2). Current direction is "DOWN", which according to the coordinate system means y decreases by 1 each step. So new_head after moving would be (5,1). 

But before moving, I need to check if moving down will cause a collision with any body cells except possibly the tail. The current body segments are [(5,3)], so no other body cells besides the head and the next segment. Wait, no—the body list is [(5,3)] which means it's just one segment behind the head. So if I move to (5,1), that cell isn't occupied by any body segments except for when the tail moves.

Wait, let me think again: The body cells are given as [(5,3)], so the snake is currently in a two-segment length—head at (5,2) and next segment at (5,3). So after moving, the new head will be (5,1), which isn't occupied by any body segments except when it was the tail before. But since the current direction is DOWN, moving down would make the snake longer if it eats the apple.

But wait, let me check the movement update rules:

1. Compute new_head: (5-0, 2+(-1)) = (5,1).
2. Check for collisions:
   - Is (5,1) outside grid? No.
   - Any collision with body cells except when tail will move? The body is [(5,3)], so no collision.

So moving down seems safe. However, if it moves to (5,1), the snake's next segment would be added at the front of the body list, making the new body [ (5,2) ] and then inserting (5,1). But since direction is DOWN, which was "NONE" after first move? Wait no—the initial direction is given as "DOWN", so each subsequent movement has to follow the rules.

Wait, but if I choose "DOWN" again, it's not allowed because you can't reverse direction. The rule says that if current direction is "DOWN", next move cannot be "UP". So moving down again would violate the "cannot reverse" rule unless it's the first move.

But in this case, initial direction is "DOWN"; so for the next moves, I can't choose "UP". But what about other directions? For example, after moving down once, if I try to move right or left, that's allowed as long as it doesn't reverse any previous non-NONE direction. Hmm.

Wait, no—the rule says you cannot reverse between "LEFT" and "RIGHT", but can continue in the same direction until stopped. But wait, actually, looking back at the rules: 

Rule 2: Cannot reverse: If current direction is "UP", next move cannot be "DOWN". Similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed.

Wait no—the rule says you can't reverse between "LEFT" and "RIGHT", but it's a bit unclear. Let me re-read:

"2. Cannot reverse: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed."

So if the current direction is "DOWN", moving up would be a reversal, but moving down again is allowed since it's the same direction. So yes, moving down multiple times in a row is acceptable.

But wait, after the initial move, when the head moves to (5,1), then the next segment becomes (5,2). But according to rule 4a: Insert old head at front of body. So after first move, the body list would be [(5,2)] added to the front—wait no.

Wait let's think step by step:

Current state:
- Head: (5,2)
- Body: [ (5,3) ]
- Direction: DOWN

First possible move is "DOWN". Compute new head as (5,1). Check collision with body. Current body cells are [(5,3)], so no collision.

Then update the body: insert old head at front—so now body becomes [ (5,2), (5,3) ]? Wait no—it says step 4a: Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1). So before moving, the body is [ (5,3) ]. After inserting old head, it's [(5,2), (5,3)], then remove tail if not eating apple.

But since the snake is currently two segments: HEAD and BODY1. So when moving down to (5,1), we add (5,2) as new_head, insert at front of body list—so the new body becomes [(5,2)] added before (5,3). But then step 4b says if not eating apple, remove tail.

Wait no: 

After computing new head:

a. Insert old head position to front of body → so for example, current body is [ (5,3) ], insert (5,2) at front → [ (5,2), (5,3) ]

Then step 4b: if not eating apple, remove tail. Since this isn't the case here, we remove last element.

So new body after move would be [ (5,2) ] and since direction is DOWN, the next segment becomes (5,1). So now snake's position is:

Head at (5,1), body segments: [(5,2)]. 

Wait that doesn't make sense. Because if you have head at (5,1), then the body after moving would be [new_head] + old_body without tail. Wait no—step 4a adds new_head to front of body list and step 4b removes last element if not eating apple.

So in this case, the current body is [(5,3)]. Step 4a: insert (5,2) → [ (5,2), (5,3) ]. Then since no apple eaten, remove tail: so new body becomes [ (5,2) ].

Wait but then after moving to (5,1), the next step would have the head at (5,1), and body as [(5,2)], which is correct because it's the previous head position. So that seems okay.

But now I'm a bit confused about how the snake moves forward. Each move shifts all segments forward by one. So moving down from (5,2) to (5,1) would cause the body segment at (5,3) to become the new tail after step 4b if no apple is eaten.

But wait in this case, we are not eating apple yet because head moves to (5,1), which isn't the apple's position. So yes, we remove the tail—so after first move, snake becomes [ (5,2) ]? No—that can’t be right because then it would disappear from body.

Wait no: After moving down, new_head is (5,1). Then insert old head at front of body → so if current body was [(5,3)], inserting (5,2), making it [(5,2), (5,3)]. Then since not eating apple, remove tail → [ (5,2) ].

Wait but then the new_head is (5,1), which isn't part of this list. That seems incorrect because all body segments should be adjacent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the update works. Let me go back to the movement update rules:

4a: Insert old head at front → so after moving down from (5,2) with current body [ (5,3) ], new_body becomes [(5,2), (5,3)]?

Wait no—it should be adding the new_head as the first element of the body. So the current body is [ (5,3) ]. After inserting new_head (5,1), it's [ (5,1), (5,3) ].

Then step 4b: if not eating apple, remove last element → so now it becomes [ (5,1) ]. 

Wait but that can't be because the snake needs to have at least one segment. But moving down would cause it to lose its body segments except for itself? That doesn't make sense.

I think I'm making a mistake here. Let's refer back to an example given:

In the example in movement rules:
- S = [ (4,4) (head), (4,3), (4,2), ... ]
When moving LEFT, new_head is (3,4). Then step 4a: insert old head at front → new body starts with (3,4), followed by the rest. If not eating apple, step 4b removes last element.

So in that case, after move, body becomes [(4,4)] and then next move would be based on current position.

Wait no—original S was [head, ...]. After moving LEFT:
new_head is (3,4). Then insert old head (4,4) at front → body list is now [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), ... ]. Then remove last element if not eating apple.

Wait in the example given, after first move:

Resulting S = [ (3,4) as head, (4,4) as body1 ].

So perhaps when moving down from (5,2):

- new_head is (5,1)
- step 4a: insert old head at front → [(5,2), (5,3)]
Wait no—the current body was [ (5,3) ]. So inserting new_head to front would be [(5,1), (5,3)].

Then in step 4b: since not eating apple, remove last element—so the body becomes [(5,1)]. But that seems like it's losing all segments except for head. That can't be right because then after next move, how does the snake proceed? It must have at least two segments to continue.

Wait no—the initial snake is of length 2: [ (5,3) ] which I think was body1, and then in step 4a when moving down:

new_head = (5,1)
insert it into front → [(5,1), (5,3)]
then if not eating apple, remove last element → so the new body is [(5,1)].

But now with only one segment, what happens next? The snake's length would be 2 again when moving down:

Wait no—it was two segments before: head at (5,2), and body [ (5,3) ] which is one segment. After step 4a: inserting new_head makes it [(5,1), (5,3)], so the body has two segments. Then in step 4b: if not eating apple, remove last → becomes [(5,1)].

So now snake is length 1? That can't be right because a snake must have at least one segment but it needs to move forward with each part connected.

Wait I'm getting confused here.

Let me try again:

Current state before any movement:
- Head: (5,2)
- Body: [ (5,3) ] → this is just the next segment behind head
So snake has two segments in total: head at 5,2 and body at 5,3

When moving down to (5,1):

new_head = (5,1)

Insert old head position into front of body list:
body becomes [ (5,2), (5,3) ]

Now since no apple is eaten, step 4b: remove the last element → new body is [ (5,2) ]

Wait so now snake's body is just [(5,2)] which was the old head.

But that leaves only one segment—head at (5,1)—but how can it move?

Hmm—it seems like after this movement, the snake would have its head at (5,1), and then no more segments. So when moving again in next step, it will just be a single head? That doesn't make sense because a snake needs to have body behind.

I think I'm making a mistake here about how the body is updated. Let me look back:

In movement update rules:
4a: Insert new_head into front of current body → so for example, if current body was [B], insert N at front → [N, B]
Then step 4b: if not eating apple, remove last element.

So in this case:

current head is (5,2), direction is down; moving to (5,1) which isn't an apple position. So step 4a: body becomes [(5,2)] added before [ (5,3) ] → [(5,2), (5,3)]

Then step 4b: since not eating apple, remove last element—so new body is [(5,2)]

So now snake's segments are:

- head at (5,1)
- tail/segment at (5,2)

But in the next move, when moving again from (5,1), direction remains down.

Compute new_head: (5,0) → which is y=0, which is out of grid since y ranges 1 to 8. So this would be invalid—snake can't go beyond borders.

Wait no—the initial y coordinate is 2 when moving down makes it 1, then trying to move down again would take y to 0, which is outside the grid (as per rules). So that's a collision with walls? No—it just moves out of grid. Wait rule 1: compute new_head—so if it goes beyond borders, it's invalid.

Wait in the movement step:

After computing new_head as (5-0, 2+(-1)) = (5,1), which is inside grid. Then check for collisions with body cells except when tail moves. Since current body after first move is [(5,3)], which doesn't include (5,1). So no collision.

But then in step 4a: insert new_head into front of body—so from [ (5,3) ] to [(5,2), (5,3)]?

Wait I think my confusion arises because the initial state after first move is not correctly handled. Let's consider each movement step carefully.

First movement:

- Current head: (5,2)
- Body: [ (5,3) ]
- Direction: DOWN

Compute new_head: (5,1)

Check for collision with body cells [(5,3)] → no.

Update body:
4a: insert old head at front → body becomes [ (5,2), (5,3) ]

Since not eating apple, step 4b removes last element → body is now [ (5,2) ]

So after first move:

- Head: (5,1)
- Body: [ (5,2) ]

But this leaves the snake as a single segment, which can't be correct because it would just disappear on next moves.

Wait no—the snake's body segments are [ (5,2) ] plus new head at (5,1). So actually, after step 4a, the body is [ (5,2), (5,3) ], then in step 4b: since not eating apple, remove last → so [(5,2)].

But wait that leaves only one segment—snake's head is now at (5,1), but no other segments. So how does it move? It can't—it must have the tail to keep moving forward.

This suggests that either I'm misapplying the rules or there's an error in my understanding of body updates.

Wait maybe when direction changes after a certain point.

Alternatively, perhaps this initial movement is not possible because the snake would be losing its body segments. Maybe if it moves down from (5,2) to (5,1), and since current body was [ (5,3) ], moving causes the body to become [(5,2)] which only has one segment.

This seems problematic—maybe I'm misunderstanding how the movement affects the body list.

Wait another approach: perhaps when you move down from (5,2):

- new_head is (5,1)
- Inserting old head at front of current body [ (5,3) ] → new body becomes [(5,2), (5,3)]
- Then since no apple eaten, remove last element → body becomes [(5,2)]

But now the snake has only one segment: its head is at (5,1), but the previous head was at (5,2). So how does it continue?

Perhaps this suggests that moving down from (5,2) in an empty environment isn't possible because after first move, the body list becomes inconsistent.

Wait maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about what needs to be achieved: getting from (5,2) towards (8,7). The apple is at (8,7), so probably moving right and up will get there.

But given that snake starts at (5,2) with body [ (5,3) ], direction DOWN. So initial movement down is to (5,1).

Wait but if I can't move left because of the previous position? Or maybe it's allowed as long as it doesn't reverse direction.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT from current head at (5,2). Let me see:

Head: (5,2)
Body: [ (5,3) ]
Direction: DOWN

If you choose "LEFT", new_head is (4,2).

Check collision with body. Body has (5,3), so no collision.

Then update body:
Insert old head at front → [(5,2), (5,3)]
Since not eating apple, remove last element → [ (5,2) ]

So now snake's body is [ (5,2) ], which again leaves only one segment. But the new head is (4,2).

Wait that can't be right—snake would have to consist of multiple segments.

I'm getting stuck here because it seems like moving in any direction causes the body list to become inconsistent after first move.

Maybe I need to think differently: perhaps when you insert a new_head into front and then remove last element without tail, but if that results in only one segment, is it allowed? Or does the snake require at least two segments?

Looking back to the initial example:

The movement update rules say step 4b says if not eating apple, body becomes previous_body minus last element.

In their example: S = [ (4,4), (4,3), ... ]

After moving LEFT:
new_head is (3,4)
insert old head at front → new body starts with (3,4), followed by rest.
then remove last → body becomes [(4,4)] and next move would have S as [(3,4) as head, (4,4) as body1]

Wait in that example, after first movement, the snake's body is [(4,4)], which was the old head.

But how can a snake with only one segment continue moving? It must have at least two segments to form a body. So perhaps when you remove the last element, but if the snake has only two segments (old_head and tail), then removing last would leave just [old_head], making it impossible to move further.

This suggests that the initial movement is invalid because after first step, the snake's body becomes inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe in this problem, the snake can have any number of segments as long as they are connected. So even if after some steps only one segment remains, but since y decreases and x increases, it might eventually reach apple without that issue.

But I'm not sure—perhaps there is a different approach to this puzzle.

Alternatively, maybe moving down from (5,2) isn't possible because the next body cell would be at (5,3), which is in front. So when you move down into (5,1), and then try to update the body, it's causing loss of segments incorrectly.

Wait perhaps when the snake moves towards a wall or something like that—it could result in no valid movement if certain conditions are met.

But I'm getting stuck here—maybe I need to consider other options for directions.

Alternatively, maybe trying to move up or left from head position (5,2) would be better because moving down might lead to losing body segments.

Let me try moving right:

Head: (5,2)
Direction: DOWN

Moving Right: new_head is (6,2)

Check collision with body [ (5,3) ] → no collision since (6,2) != (5,3)

Update body:
Insert old head at front → [(5,2), (5,3)]
Since not eating apple, remove last element → [ (5,2) ]

So now snake's segments are:

- Head: (6,2)
- Body: [ (5,2) ]

Wait that doesn't make sense because the body is behind. So if you have head at (6,2), and tail at (5,2), but moving forward—how does it move again?

Hmm—it seems like after first movement right to (6,2), snake's body becomes [ (5,2) ], which is one segment.

But the next movement would require that from (6,2), direction remains down. Compute new_head: (6,1). Check collision with current body [(5,2)]—no collision because 6≠5 in x or y coordinates?

Wait no—coordinates are different; moving from (6,2) to (6,1).

Current body is [ (5,2) ].

So new_head is (6,1), which doesn't collide with any body cell except if (5,2) is same as (6,1)—which they aren't. So no collision.

Update body:

Insert old head at front → [(6,2), (5,2)]

Since not eating apple, remove last element → [ (6,2) ]

So now snake's segments are: head at (6,1), and body at (6,2). Wait that can't be right—it should be the other way.

Wait no—the current movement is from (6,2) to (6,1):

- new_head = (6,1)
- Insert old head (6,2) into front of body [ (5,2) ] → body becomes [(6,2), (5,2)]
- Then remove last element → [ (6,2) ]

So now the snake has only one segment: at (6,2). But how? That seems incorrect.

Wait I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe moving right isn't possible because it's causing loss of body segments after each move. Alternatively, perhaps this suggests that certain movements are invalid and lead to a contradiction in the snake's structure.

Given all these complications, maybe there's another approach. Perhaps trying to get closer to apple (8,7) by moving in such a way that the snake can grow longer or adjust its body without losing segments.

Alternatively, since I'm stuck on the initial movement steps, perhaps looking for other clues—like possible direction changes that would allow proper body structure after each move.

Wait another thought: When you move into an apple position, the tail is not removed. So in that case, when moving to a new cell with an apple:

- Compute new_head
- Insert old head at front of current body
- Since eating apple, do NOT remove last element

So for example, if snake's head moves into (8,7), which has the apple, then the tail isn't removed. So the body would grow.

But in this problem, initially, the apple is not on any cell except at (8,7). So to reach it, the snake must move towards right and up direction.

Wait but initial head position is (5,2), body [ (5,3) ], so from there moving up may be possible. Let's try that:

Current head: (5,2)
Direction: DOWN

If you choose "UP", new_head would be (4,2).

Check collision with current body [(5,3)] → no.

Update body:
Insert old head at front → [ (5,2), (5,3) ]
Since not eating apple, remove last element → [ (5,2) ]

Now snake's segments are:

- Head: (4,2)
- Body: [ (5,2) ]

But again, moving from (4,2)—how?

Wait no—the body after step 4a is [(5,2), (5,3)], then in step 4b—since not eating apple, remove last → [ (5,2) ]

So now the snake's segments are:

- Head at (4,2)
- Tail/b<body at (5,2)

Wait that can't be—it should have multiple segments.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP isn't possible because of how the body is being updated. Maybe certain directions aren't allowed unless they result in valid movements without losing segments.

Given all these complexities, maybe it's time to think about what steps are needed in code terms.

But since I'm trying to do this manually, let me try another approach: perhaps moving right first and seeing where that leads.

Wait head is at (5,2), body [ (5,3) ]

If you choose "RIGHT", new_head becomes (6,2)

Check collision with current body [(5,3)] → no

Insert old head at front → [(5,2), (5,3)]

Remove last element because not eating apple → [ (5,2) ]

So now snake's segments are:

- Head: (6,2)
- Body: [ (5,2) ]

Wait that leaves a single segment again.

I think I'm missing something. Maybe when you move into an empty cell without eating the apple and then remove last body element, but in this case, removing leads to head not having enough segments for forward movement.

Alternatively, perhaps moving right is possible because it's allowed by the rules, even if after first step the snake becomes a single segment. But that seems impossible—it must have multiple segments.

Wait maybe my mistake was thinking about how body updates work. Let me re-express the update steps:

- Compute new_head
- Insert old head at front of current body → this adds one more segment (old head) before all existing body
- Then, if not eating apple, remove last element to form next state

So for example:

Initial state:
Head: H0 = (5,2)
Body: B1 = (5,3)

Step 1: Choose direction RIGHT → new_head = (6,2)

Insert H0 at front of current body: new_body = [H0] + previous_body => [(5,2), (5,3)]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: new_body becomes [(5,2)]

So now:

Head is (6,2)
Body is [(5,2)]

This seems inconsistent because after moving to (6,2), the body should be [ (5,2) ] which doesn't form a proper snake.

Wait no—the previous head was at H0 = (5,2). So when you insert it into front of current body:

- Current body is B1 = [(5,3)]

Inserting H0 before → new_body becomes [H0, B1] => [ (5,2), (5,3) ]

Then removing last element because no apple: new_body is [ (5,2) ]

So now the snake's segments are:

- Head at (6,2)
- Only one segment at (5,2)

But how can you move forward if body has only one segment?

I think perhaps this movement isn't allowed because after moving to (6,2), the body is not connected. So it must be that certain directions or steps aren't possible.

This suggests that when trying to move in a direction where inserting old head and then removing last element would result in a single segment, such movements are invalid unless the snake can adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps this indicates that moving right isn't a viable initial step because of the resulting body structure. Therefore, maybe choosing another direction initially is better.

Wait let's try to move up from (5,2):

new_head = (4,2)

Check collision with current body [(5,3)] → no

Insert old head at front → [H0] + B1 => [ (5,2), (5,3) ]

Then remove last element: new_body is [ (5,2) ]

So now:

Head: (4,2)
Body: [ (5,2) ]

Again same problem.

Wait maybe it's impossible to move in any direction without causing body segments loss. So perhaps the initial movement can't happen as described—meaning that the snake must not have an option but stay still?

But that seems unlikely because it would mean no solution exists, which is probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body update works when moving into a new cell.

Wait another thought: Maybe when you move to a new cell without eating apple (i.e., moving in a straight line), your new head becomes connected to the old tail. So after inserting H0 at front and then removing last element, the new body is H0 followed by rest of B1 except last.

But wait—no, because if current_body has multiple segments, say length N, then inserting one more (H0) makes it N+1, but since you remove the last when not eating apple, net gain is 0. So snake remains same length.

Wait for example:

current_head = H
current_body = [B1, B2]

Step: move to new head direction, no apple eaten

Insert H into front → [H, B1, B2]
Then remove last element → [H, B1]

So body reduces by one. So the number of segments decreases.

Wait but that would mean that when moving forward without eating apple, snake loses a segment each time? That can't be right because in the game Snake normally grows when you eat an apple.

Alternatively, perhaps I have it backwards: When you don't eat an apple, you lose a body part, so your body size decreases by one. But how does that make sense with the standard game mechanics?

Wait in this problem's rules:

- When moving to new cell and eating apple, tail isn't removed → snake grows.

- Otherwise (not eating), remove last element → snake loses length.

So that aligns with standard Snake: eat apple → grow, not eat → lose last segment.

Therefore, when the movement is towards an empty cell, you insert old head at front of body and then remove last—so net effect is no change in number of segments. Because:

new_body = [H_old] + B → length increases by 1

then, if not eating apple: new_body becomes [H_old] + B[0...-2] → so total same as before.

Wait that's possible only when body has more than one segment.

For example, body is [B1, B2]

After inserting H_old at front:

new_body = [H_old, B1, B2], length 3

If not eating apple: remove last element. So new_body becomes [H_old, B1] → same as original body? No—original was [B1, B2]. Wait wait.

Wait in this case, initial body is [B1, B2]

After inserting H_old:

new_body = [H_old, B1, B2], length 3

then remove last element (because not eating apple):

new_body becomes [H_old, B1] → which was the original's first segment.

Wait that can't be right. So after moving in a direction without eating apple, your body is just H_old followed by all but last of previous body.

So in this case, snake loses one segment because you removed from the end.

But if initial body has only one segment:

current_body = [B1]

After inserting H_old at front: new_body = [H_old, B1], length 2

Then remove last element (since no apple): new_body becomes [H_old] → so back to single segment.

So in that case, movement would leave you with a single segment again.

This suggests that if the snake is of minimal size—like having only one body segment—you can't move without losing segments. So perhaps this initial condition isn't possible unless moving into empty cells causes loss of segments but without any benefit.

But wait earlier thought: when eating an apple, tail isn't removed → so growth occurs, increasing the number of segments.

So in order to grow longer, snake must be able to eat apples and thus add body segments.

Given all this, perhaps I should try a different approach by considering how many directions are possible each time based on current position and previous head.

But maybe it's better to model this as a grid with the initial positions of the snake and apple, then try to move towards the apple in such a way that doesn't lead to impossible situations—like losing body parts but not gaining any new ones unless eating an apple.

Given all these complexities, I'm starting to think that perhaps the key is to plan a path where the snake can grow by eating apples without losing too many segments each time. But since there's only one apple at (8,7), we need to reach it by moving towards it step by step.

Wait but in this problem, the initial position of the apple isn't clear—oh wait no—the user didn't specify where the apple is; they just provided an example with a grid and movement directions. Wait looking back, actually:

In the original question prompt, there's only one Apple at (8,7). So that seems to be fixed.

So perhaps our snake needs to navigate from position (5,2) towards (8,7), moving in such a way that it can reach without getting stuck due to losing body segments.

But as I've been analyzing earlier, movement choices lead the snake into either:

- Getting closer to apple but causing loss of body parts each time unless eating an apple.
  
Which suggests that perhaps the optimal path is one where we eat some apples along the way to grow the snake and have enough length to reach (8,7) without getting stuck.

But wait in this problem setup: there's only one Apple at (8,7). So if the snake can move towards it by eating that apple when close enough, but initial steps might require careful movement.

Wait perhaps I should model this as a grid where each cell is either part of the snake or empty. Starting from (5,2), need to reach (8,7) via valid moves.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible to write out all possible directions step by step until reaching apple. But given time constraints, perhaps looking for an answer that involves moving up and right strategically.

Wait but I'm getting stuck in the initial steps—perhaps trying to find another way around is better.

Another thought: Maybe after moving into certain cells without eating an apple, you can manage your body segments such that it doesn't lead to a loss of necessary parts. Or perhaps use turns to reorient and grow.

Alternatively, considering all possibilities exhaustively might take too long—perhaps the answer requires figuring out the sequence based on possible steps towards (8,7).

But given time constraints, I think the most plausible direction is moving up first or right first, but due to limited information, it's challenging. Maybe the correct initial move is to go RIGHT.

Wait let me try:

Current head: (5,2), body [(5,3)]

Choose "RIGHT": new_head = (6,2)

No collision with current_body[(5,3)] → OK

Update body:
new_body = [ (5,2) ] + [ (5,3) ]
Since not eating apple, remove last element: new_body is [ (5,2) ]

So now snake's segments are:

Head at (6,2)
Body at (5,2)

But how?

Wait perhaps it's acceptable because the body can be considered as moving up. So from position (6,2), you can then move to (7,2), etc.

Then next step: From (6,2), direction RIGHT again:

new_head = (7,2)
No collision with current_body [5,2]
Insert H_old into front → new_body is [(6,2)] + [5,3] ?

Wait no—the previous body after first step was [5,2]. So inserting H_old at front would be:

[6,2] followed by [5,2]

Then since not eating apple: remove last element. So new_body becomes [6,2]

So now snake's segments are:

Head (7,2)
Body [6,2]

But again same issue.

Wait maybe that approach is leading me nowhere—maybe trying to move up first isn't the way either.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should instead try to think about what moves would allow the snake to grow towards the apple. Since in order to reach (8,7), which has higher x and y coordinates than current position (5,2). So it's clear that moving right increases x coordinate, while moving up decreases y coordinate? Wait no—coordinates are 1-based?

Wait assuming standard grid where increasing Y goes down.

So moving UP would decrease Y; moving DOWN increases Y. But the head is at (5,2), so to reach higher Y and X, need to move DOWN for Y or RIGHT for X.

But since apple is at (8,7), which has higher both x and y compared to 5,2: from 5 to 8 is +3 in x; from 2 to 7 is +5 in y. So the head needs to go right a lot and up a bit? Wait no—because if Y increases downward.

So (1,1) would be top-left corner, moving down towards higher numbers on Y-axis.

Therefore, to reach apple at (8,7), which has larger X and larger Y compared to current position (5,2). So the head needs to move right 3 times and down 5 times? Or is it the other way?

Wait no—the current Y is 2. To get to Y=7, need to decrease by moving UP: because from row 2, moving up would go to row1.

But wait in a standard grid where (0,0) is top-left, and coordinates increase downwards for Y. So if you are at (5,2), moving down increases Y, so towards apple's Y=7 which requires more down moves.

So perhaps the direction should be moving right 3 times and down several times to reach (8,7).

But I'm getting stuck on how body segments affect movement here.

Maybe it's time to consider that without a clear path due to losing body parts, maybe only possible if apple is in certain positions—like snake can't proceed unless there's an alternative way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer requires moving RIGHT first.

Given all this confusion, I think the most likely move for the initial step is to go RIGHT. Therefore, from (5,2) towards (6,2), etc., which might allow progression toward higher X and eventually reach Y=7 through downward moves.
</think>

The snake should initially move to the right, increasing its x-coordinate by 1 each time, until it can turn upwards or downwards while managing body segments correctly. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (5,2) with a single body segment at (5,3).

2. **First Move - Right**: 
   - New head position: (6,2).
   - Check for collisions; none found.
   - Update body: Insert old head (5,2) at front of current body [(5,3)] → new body is [5,2].
   - Since not eating an apple, remove last element. Now the snake's segments are only the new head.

3. **Subsequent Moves**: Repeat similar steps, moving right until reaching a position where turning upwards (or downwards) allows proper alignment without losing too many body parts, eventually leading towards the apple at (8,7).

The final answer is to move RIGHT first.

Answer: \boxed{RIGHT}
