========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from its current position (8,6) to eat the apple at (2,7). The snake is currently moving UP, and its body is in specific positions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the grid. The snake's head is at (8,6), which is near the top-right corner since y increases upwards. The apple is at (2,7), which is on the upper-left side of the grid but not too far from where the snake is. 

Looking at the movement rules, the snake can't reverse direction immediately. Since it's currently moving UP, the next move can't be DOWN. Also, the body positions are given as [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)]. So the body is extending from (7,2) up to (8,5). 

The snake's head is moving UP, so after each move, the body shifts. When the apple is eaten, the tail doesn't shrink, so the snake grows by one segment.

From the current position, I need to plan a path that avoids collisions with the body and walls. Also, after eating the apple, there should be at least one legal move left to prevent trapping the snake.

Let me calculate the required movement. The head needs to go from x=8 to x=2, which is a decrease of 6 units. So, more LEFT moves than RIGHT. Similarly, y increases by 1 (from 6 to 7), so more UP moves than DOWN.

Possible route: Maybe moving left first, then up? But the snake is currently moving UP, so changing direction to LEFT next would be allowed since it's not reversing. 

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Move LEFT from (8,6) to (7,6). Check if this position is safe. Looking at body cells: The body doesn't include (7,6), but I need to see if any part of the snake will collide after moving. Since the body is [(7,2), (8,2)...], moving to (7,6) should be okay.

2. Then, move LEFT again to (6,6). Check for collisions here as well.

3. Continue moving LEFT until x=2. But wait, that's a lot of moves and might take too long. Maybe there's a more efficient path.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can move UP first before turning left. Wait, but it's already going UP. So from (8,6), moving UP would go to (8,7). That's one step closer in y-direction. Then, moving LEFT multiple times.

Wait, let me check if moving UP is possible without collision. The body includes (8,5) as the last segment before the head. Moving UP to (8,7) won't collide with any part of the body since the next positions are all below 7 in y.

After moving UP to (8,7), then start moving LEFT towards x=2. Let me see how many steps that would take. From x=8 to x=2 is a difference of 6, so 6 LEFT moves. Plus the initial UP move, total 7 moves.

But I also need to make sure that after eating the apple at (2,7), there's still space to move. So when the snake reaches the apple, its tail will stay, making it longer by one segment. Therefore, I need to ensure that after moving into the apple position, the new head is at (2,7) and the body doesn't block any possible next moves.

Wait, but when the snake eats the apple, the tail doesn't shrink, so the snake's length increases. So after eating, the snake will have more segments, which could potentially block movement if not planned carefully.

Let me consider the path again:

1. UP to (8,7). This is one move.
2. Then LEFT 6 times: each time moving x decreases by 1, y remains 7.

But let's list all moves step by step:

Move 1: UP -> (8,7)
Now body becomes [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)] and head is at (8,7).

Then, the next move must be LEFT since we can't go back DOWN. So:

Move 2: LEFT to (7,7). Check if this is safe. The body doesn't include (7,7), so it's okay.

Wait a minute, but after moving UP and then LEFT, the snake's body might block some paths. Also, I need to ensure that each step doesn't cause collision with the current body.

Let me check each move:

After first move (UP) to (8,7): The body is [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)] because the tail hasn't moved yet. Wait, no—the tail moves every step except when eating an apple. So after moving UP, the previous head position (8,6) becomes part of the body, making the body [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)]. Now, the snake's length is 6 segments.

Wait no: The initial body list includes the tail. So when moving, the head moves, and each body segment follows the one in front of it. So after moving UP, the new body would be [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)] plus the new position.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

The snake's body is given as [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)]. So these are five segments excluding the head at (8,6). After moving UP to (8,7), the new head is (8,7), and the previous positions become part of the body. So the body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)], making a total length of 5 segments.

Wait no: Initially, the snake has a head at (8,6) and five body segments. After moving, the new head is added, so the body grows by one unless the apple is eaten.

So after moving UP once, the snake's body becomes [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)] + (8,6) as the tail. Wait, no—snake moves, so each part follows.

Actually, when the head moves, all body parts shift forward. So after moving UP:

- The new head is at (8,7).
- The previous positions (from tail to just before head) move forward by one.
So the body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)].

Wait, that's not correct. Each segment moves into the position of the segment in front of it. So the initial body is [B1=(7,2), B2=(8,2), B3=(8,3), B4=(8,4), B5=(8,5)]. The head is at (8,6). After moving UP to (8,7):

- New head: (8,7)
- B1 moves to where B2 was: (8,2) → (8,3)
- B2 moves to where B3 was: (8,3) → (8,4)
- B3 moves to where B4 was: (8,4) → (8,5)
- B4 moves to where B5 was: (8,5) → (8,6)
- B5 moves to where the old head was: (8,6) → (8,7). Wait no—because when the head moves, the body follows.

Wait, I think each body segment moves into the position of the next segment. So after moving UP, the new positions are:

Head: (8,7)

Body segments:
- Previous B1=(7,2): now at (8,2)
- Previous B2=(8,2): now at (8,3)
- Previous B3=(8,3): now at (8,4)
- Previous B4=(8,4): now at (8,5)
- Previous B5=(8,5): now at (8,6)

So the new body is [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)].

Thus, after moving UP to (8,7), the snake's body includes positions from (8,2) up to (8,6). So when planning the next moves, I need to make sure that each new head position doesn't collide with any of these.

Now, for the next move: moving LEFT. From (8,7), moving LEFT would take us to (7,7). Let's check if this is safe. The body segments are [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)], and none of them are at (7,7) or any position the snake will occupy next.

But wait, when moving LEFT to (7,7), after that move, the body would shift again. So new head is (7,7), body becomes [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)]. But this position (7,7) isn't in any of these body parts yet because it's a new position.

Wait no: After moving LEFT from (8,7) to (7,7), the body would be:

- Previous head at (8,7)
- So the new body is [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)] and the tail is removed unless apple is eaten.

Wait no: Without eating the apple, the tail is removed. But in this case, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so after each move, the snake's length remains the same except when it eats an apple.

So initially, before moving, the snake has 5 body segments (excluding head). After moving UP to (8,7), the body becomes 5 segments: [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)]. Then, when moving LEFT to (7,7), the new body would be [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)].

But wait, does that make sense? Or is it that each move shifts all segments forward?

I think I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try a different approach: plan the moves step by step and check for collisions at each step.

Starting position:
Head: (8,6)
Body: [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)]
Apple: (2,7)

First move: Can't reverse direction. Current direction is UP, so next move can be LEFT or RIGHT.

Option 1: Move LEFT first to (7,6). Is this safe?

After moving LEFT:
Head: (7,6)
Body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)] because each segment moves forward. So body positions are now at (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). The new head is at (7,6). Check if any of the body parts are at (7,6)? No, so it's safe.

Next move: Can't reverse direction from LEFT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But moving RIGHT would take us back towards higher x-values, which might not be efficient. Let me think about the path.

Alternatively, maybe after moving LEFT once, I can start moving UP to reach y=7.

But wait, the apple is at (2,7), so we need to decrease x and increase y. So perhaps a better approach is to move up first, then left.

Wait, but initially moving LEFT might not be the best because it's further away from the apple in the x-direction.

Alternatively, another plan:

1. Move UP once to (8,7). Is this safe? Let me check: The body after this move would be [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)]. So moving UP to (8,7) is possible because none of the body parts are at (8,7). So yes.

Now head is at (8,7).

Next move: Can't go DOWN since we came from UP. So can go LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait, direction after first move becomes UP, then next move must be non-DOWN. Since current direction is UP, the next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE (but in this case, the snake has to choose a valid direction). So moving LEFT seems better.

Move 2: LEFT to (7,7). Check safety: body is [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)] after this move. Wait no—after moving UP, the body was [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)], and head is at (8,7). Then moving LEFT to (7,7) would make the body segments shift:

- The new head is (7,7)
- Previous segments move forward: so body becomes [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)].

So (7,7) isn't in the body positions after this move, so it's safe.

Move 3: LEFT to (6,7). Check if this is safe. The new body segments would be [(8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7)]. So (6,7) isn't in the body, so it's okay.

Move 4: LEFT to (5,7). Body becomes [(8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7)] → no collision.

Move 5: LEFT to (4,7). Same check: safe.

Move 6: LEFT to (3,7). Safe.

Move 7: LEFT to (2,7). Now we've reached the apple. So this is the desired position.

Wait, but wait—each move after moving UP requires moving LEFT multiple times, which may cause the body to extend towards lower x-values, possibly causing collision.

Let me list all the moves and check for collisions:

Move 1: UP → (8,7)
Body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)]
No collision since (8,7) is not in body.

Move 2: LEFT → (7,7)
Body after move: [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)] → (7,7) not present. Safe.

Move 3: LEFT → (6,7)
Body: [(8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7)] → safe.

Move 4: LEFT → (5,7)
Body: [(8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7)] → safe.

Move 5: LEFT → (4,7)
Body: [(8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)] → safe.

Move 6: LEFT → (3,7)
Body: [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)] → safe.

Move 7: LEFT → (2,7) where the apple is. Now, check if any body part is at (2,7). The body after this move would be [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)], so no collision.

But wait—after each move, we have to make sure that the new head position doesn't collide with any part of the body, including itself. So in this case, moving LEFT seven times after moving UP seems possible without collisions.

However, the number of moves required is quite a lot: 1 (UP) + 6 (LEFT) = 7 moves to reach the apple. But maybe there's a more efficient path.

Alternatively, what if we move RIGHT first? Let me check:

Move 1: RIGHT → (9,6). Is this allowed? The grid isn't specified in size, so assuming it's large enough, but we have to check for boundaries and collisions.

After moving RIGHT to (9,6), the body would be [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)]. So (9,6) isn't in the body. Safe.

Then move UP several times, but this seems counterproductive since we need to decrease x towards 2.

Alternatively, moving DOWN: from (8,6), moving DOWN would take us to (8,5). But (8,5) is part of the body. So that's a collision and not allowed.

So perhaps moving LEFT after UP is better.

Wait, but let me think again about the initial move. If I move UP first to (8,7), then move LEFT six times to reach (2,7). That would require 1 + 6 = 7 moves.

Alternatively, what if I move LEFT first and then UP? Let's see:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,6)
Body becomes [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)]. Wait no—the initial body is [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5)], head at (8,6). Moving LEFT to (7,6):

- New head: (7,6)
- Body segments move forward:
  - B1=(7,2) → (8,2)
  - B2=(8,2) → (8,3)
  - B3=(8,3) → (8,4)
  - B4=(8,4) → (8,5)
  - B5=(8,5) → (8,6)
So the new body is [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)]. Now, check if any of these positions collide with the new head at (7,6). No.

Move 2: UP to (7,7). Check safety: body becomes [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)] → no collision with (7,7).

Now, we need to move LEFT five more times to reach x=2.

But this path requires 1 (LEFT) + 1 (UP) + 5 (LEFT) = 7 moves as well. Same number of steps but perhaps a different route.

Is there a way to reduce the number of moves? Let's see:

Another idea: move UP multiple times first, then LEFT. But each move can only change direction if it doesn't reverse.

Wait, after moving UP once, you can choose any direction except DOWN. So maybe alternate between UP and LEFT, but that might not be more efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a path that allows the snake to reach the apple in fewer moves by cleverly choosing directions.

But considering the grid positions, we need to decrease x from 8 to 2 (a total of -6) and increase y from 6 to 7 (a total of +1). So net movement is 6 left and 1 up. Since each move can only change one coordinate by 1, it would require at least 6 moves in the x-direction and 1 in the y-direction, totaling 7 moves.

Therefore, regardless of the path, it's impossible to reach the apple in fewer than 7 moves because we have to cover a total distance of 6 left and 1 up, which is 7 steps. So the minimum number of moves required is 7.

But let me confirm this by trying another approach:

Calculate Manhattan distance: |8-2| + |6-7| = 6 + 1 = 7. Since in each move, the snake can only change one coordinate by 1, the minimal number of moves is indeed 7.

So whether we go UP first then LEFT or LEFT first then UP, it's going to take at least 7 moves.

But wait, another thought: What if some moves allow us to cover both x and y changes more efficiently? For example, moving diagonally. But in this problem, the snake can only move in four cardinal directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), not diagonally, so each move affects only one coordinate by 1.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves is indeed 7.

But let's make sure that there are no obstacles or constraints I'm missing. The problem doesn't mention any grid boundaries or other obstacles, just the snake and the apple. So assuming an infinite grid, it's possible to reach the apple in 7 moves without collision.

Thus, the answer should be 7 moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required for a snake to reach an apple on a grid. The snake can move in four cardinal directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) and cannot reverse direction in consecutive moves.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake starts at position (8, 6), and the apple is located at (2, 7). The goal is to find the shortest path for the snake to reach the apple.
2. **Manhattan Distance**: Calculate the Manhattan distance between the starting point and the target. This distance gives us the minimum number of moves required if there are no obstacles. The Manhattan distance formula is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
   \]
   Applying this to our coordinates:
   \[
   |8 - 2| + |6 - 7| = 6 + 1 = 7
   \]
3. **Path Determination**: Since the Manhattan distance is 7, the minimum number of moves required is also 7. The snake can move in any order that covers both the horizontal (left) and vertical (up) movements without reversing direction consecutively.

### Solution Code
```python
def minimal_moves(start, end):
    x1, y1 = start
    x2, y2 = end
    return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)

start = (8, 6)
end = (2, 7)
print(minimal_moves(start, end))
```

### Explanation
- **Problem Analysis**: The snake starts at (8, 6) and needs to reach (2, 7). The movement is restricted to the four cardinal directions.
- **Manhattan Distance Calculation**: Using the Manhattan distance formula, we determine that the minimum number of moves required is 7. This calculation assumes an open grid with no obstacles and allows the snake to move optimally without reversing direction consecutively.
- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently computes the minimal path using basic arithmetic operations, making it both optimal and straightforward.

The final answer is printed as 7 moves, which is the minimum number required for the snake to reach the apple.
