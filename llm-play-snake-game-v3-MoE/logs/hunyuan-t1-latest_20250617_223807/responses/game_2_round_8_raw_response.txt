{
"moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right (from x=3 to x=5) and down (from y=7 to y=0). Starting with DOWN avoids reversing the initial LEFT direction and begins descending. Subsequent RIGHT moves adjust the x-coordinate toward the apple, then continued DOWN moves descend toward y=0. Each step checks for collisions with the body (which shifts safely away from the path) and stays in bounds. After reaching the apple, the snake can still move left or right, avoiding immediate trapping."
