<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (7,1). The current direction is UP. The body segments are [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (8,2)]. So the snake is currently moving upwards, and the body follows. 

First, I need to figure out a path from (5,5) to (7,1) without colliding with the body or the walls. Let me visualize the grid. The head is at (5,5), which is in the middle. The apple is lower down, at (7,1). So the snake needs to move right twice and down four times. But the body is in the way. Let me check where the body is.

The body segments are [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (8,2)]. So from the head (5,5), the next body segment is (5,4), then (6,4), etc. So the body is extending to the right and down from the head. If the snake moves up, the next head position would be (5,6), but the current direction is UP. However, the problem is that the snake's body is in the path. 

But the current direction is UP, so the next move can't be DOWN. So the first move can't be DOWN. But the snake is at (5,5), and the apple is at (7,1). Let's think step by step.

First, the snake's head is at (5,5). The apple is at (7,1). The head needs to move right and down. But the body is in the way. Let's check if moving right is possible. Let's see the body positions. The current body segments are (5,4), (6,4), etc. So if the snake moves right, the new head would be (6,5). Is that position occupied by any body part? Let's see the body segments. The body parts are (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), etc. So (6,5) is not in the body. That's safe. So moving right would be a possible first move.

Alternatively, moving up would take the head to (5,6), but that's also not in the body. But the current direction is UP, so the first move can't be DOWN. However, the snake can move in any direction except the reverse. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN. But moving right or left or up again is allowed.

But the apple is to the right and down. So maybe the best path is to move right, then down. Let's try that.

First move: RIGHT. New head is (6,5). Then check if that's safe. The body is [(5,4), (6,4), ...]. So (6,5) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then the body would update. Since the snake didn't eat the apple, the tail moves. So the body becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (8,2)] and then remove the last element (8,2), making it [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)].

Now the head is at (6,5). Next move: maybe move right again. New head would be (7,5). Check if that's safe. The body segments are [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)]. So (7,5) is not in the body. Safe. Then body updates again. But the apple is at (7,1). So moving down from here.

But maybe there's a better path. Let's see. The apple is at (7,1). The head is moving towards it. However, the body is in the way. Let me think of the steps required. The head needs to go from (5,5) to (7,1). That's two steps right and four steps down. But the body is in the way. So perhaps the snake can move right, then down, but need to avoid the body segments.

Another approach: Let's simulate each move step by step.

Initial state:

Head: (5,5)
Body: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (8,2)]
Apple: (7,1)

First move: RIGHT (from (5,5) to (6,5)). Check collision. The new head (6,5) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then the body becomes [(5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (8,2)] and then remove the last element (8,2) → [(5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)].

Now the head is (6,5), body is [(5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)].

Next move: RIGHT again to (7,5). Check collision. The body is [(5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)]. So (7,5) is not in the body. Safe. Body becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)] and then remove the last element (7,2) → [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3)].

Now head is (7,5). Next, need to move down. Let's try moving down (from (7,5) to (7,4)). Check if that's safe. The body is [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3)]. (7,4) is not in the body. So that's safe. Body becomes [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3)] and then remove the last element (7,3) → [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)].

Now head is (7,4). Next move: down again to (7,3). Check if that's safe. The body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. (7,3) is in the body? The body includes (7,3) as part of the original body. Wait, no. The current body after the last move is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. So (7,3) is not in the body. Wait, the body was [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3)] before removing the tail. After removing the tail (7,3), the body is [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. So the current body is those positions. So moving to (7,3) is safe. So new head is (7,3). Check if that's in the body. The body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. (7,3) is not in the body. So that's okay. Then the body becomes [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)] and remove the last element (6,3) → [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)].

Now the head is at (7,3). Next, need to move down again. From (7,3) to (7,2). But (7,2) is part of the body? Let's check the current body. The body is [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)]. (7,2) is not in the body. So that's safe. Moving down to (7,2). Then body becomes [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)] and remove the last element (6,4) → [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)].

Now the head is at (7,2). Next move down to (7,1). That's the apple's position. Check collision. The body is [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. So (7,1) is not in the body. Safe. So moving down to (7,1) would be the next step. Then, since the apple is eaten, the body doesn't remove the tail. So the body becomes [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)] (wait, no, the body after moving to (7,2) was [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)] and then removing the last element (5,5)? No, the previous step was moving to (7,2), which would add (7,2) to the body and remove the last element. Let me retrace.

After moving to (7,2), the body was [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)]? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to simulate again step by step.

First move: RIGHT to (6,5). Body becomes [(5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)].

Second move: RIGHT to (7,5). Body becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)] → after removing the last element (7,2) → [(6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3)].

Third move: DOWN to (7,4). Body becomes [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3)] → after removing (7,3) → [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)].

Fourth move: DOWN to (7,3). Body becomes [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)] → after removing (6,3) → [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)].

Fifth move: DOWN to (7,2). Body becomes [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)] → after removing (6,4) → [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)].

Now, sixth move: DOWN to (7,1). That's the apple's position. So the head moves to (7,1). Check if that's safe. The body is [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. (7,1) is not in the body. So that's safe. Now, since the apple is eaten, the body doesn't remove the tail. So the new body is [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)] (wait, no. The previous body after the fifth move was [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], and the head is at (7,2). When moving to (7,1), the body becomes [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], and since the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed. So the body length increases by one. Wait, but the snake ate the apple, so the body should not remove the tail. So the body after eating the apple would be [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)]? No, the body was [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)] before the move. Then when moving to (7,1), the new head is (7,1), and the body is updated by adding the previous head (7,2) to the body and not removing the tail. So the body becomes [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. So the tail is the last element, which is (5,5). So the body length is the same as before, but the head is now at (7,1). 

So the moves would be: RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. That's six moves. But let's check if there's any collision during these steps. 

Another thing to consider: when the snake moves down to (7,1), the apple is eaten. So the body doesn't get shorter. However, during the moves before that, the snake's body was moving, and the path was clear. 

So the sequence of moves would be:

1. RIGHT (to 6,5)
2. RIGHT (to 7,5)
3. DOWN (to 7,4)
4. DOWN (to 7,3)
5. DOWN (to 7,2)
6. DOWN (to 7,1)

That's six moves. Let me check each step again for collision:

Step 1: (6,5) not in body. Safe.

Step 2: (7,5) not in body. Safe.

Step 3: (7,4) not in body. Safe.

Step 4: (7,3) not in body. Safe.

Step 5: (7,2) not in body. Safe.

Step 6: (7,1) not in body. Safe.

Yes, that seems to work. However, during step 4, when moving to (7,3), the body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. So (7,3) is not in the body. Correct. 

Another possible path: maybe moving down first. But the initial direction is up, so first move can't be down. So the first move has to be right, up, or left. But moving left would take the head to (4,5), which is not in the body, but that's not helpful for reaching the apple. Moving up would take the head to (5,6). But that might not be the best path. 

Alternatively, after moving right to (6,5), then moving down. Let's see:

After first move (6,5), then move down to (6,4). But (6,4) is part of the body. Because the body is [(5,5), (6,4), ...]. So (6,4) is the second element in the body. So moving to (6,4) would collide with the body. So that's not allowed. Therefore, after moving right to (6,5), the next move can't be down. Hence, the next move must be right again to (7,5), then down. 

Thus, the initial plan of moving right, right, then down four times seems valid. 

Another check: when the snake is at (7,3) (step 4), the body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. So (7,3) is not in the body. Then moving to (7,2) is safe. 

Yes. So the sequence of moves is RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. That's six moves. 

But the problem is that the initial direction is UP, so the first move can't be DOWN. But the first move is RIGHT, which is allowed. 

So the answer would be the sequence of moves: RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. 

But let me check if there's any alternative path with fewer steps. For example, can the snake move in a different way to reach the apple? 

Another possible path: Right, Down, Right, Down, Down, Down. Let's see:

First move: RIGHT to (6,5). Safe. 

Second move: DOWN to (6,4). But (6,4) is in the body. So that's not allowed. 

So that's invalid. 

Alternative: Right, then Down, but not to (6,4). For example, after (6,5), move to the left? No, that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, after (6,5), move up again? That would take the head to (6,6). But that's not helpful. 

So the initial plan seems the only viable path. 

Thus, the correct sequence is RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. 

But let me check again for the step when moving to (7,3) and (7,2). 

At step 4, head is at (7,3). The body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. So (7,3) is not in the body. Then step 5, moving down to (7,2). The body is [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4), (6,3)] → after removing the last element (6,3), the body is [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (6,4)]. So (7,2) is not in the body. Safe. Then step 6, moving down to (7,1), which is not in the body. 

Yes. 

Thus, the answer is the sequence of moves: RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.
</think>

To determine the correct sequence of moves for the snake to reach the apple located at position (7,1), starting from its initial position (5,5) and moving in a grid where the snake's body blocks certain paths, we must carefully analyze each possible move and ensure that the snake does not collide with itself.

---

### **Initial Conditions**
- **Snake's Starting Position**: (5,5)
- **Apple's Position**: (7,1)
- **Snake's Direction**: Initially facing **UP** (but movement direction is not necessarily constrained by this)
- **Rules**:
  - The snake moves one cell at a time.
  - It cannot move into a cell that is currently occupied by its own body.
  - The snake may change direction as needed.
  - The goal is to reach the apple.

---

### **Step-by-Step Movement Plan**

Let’s simulate the snake’s path step by step, ensuring that it does not collide with its body and eventually reaches the apple:

#### **Move 1: RIGHT → (6,5)**
- The body does not yet include (6,5), so this move is valid.

#### **Move 2: RIGHT → (7,5)**
- Still no collision with the body.

#### **Move 3: DOWN → (7,4)**
- No collision with body.

#### **Move 4: DOWN → (7,3)**
- No collision with body.

#### **Move 5: DOWN → (7,2)**
- No collision with body.

#### **Move 6: DOWN → (7,1)**
- The snake reaches the apple.
- The body does not yet include (7,1), and since the apple is eaten, the body does not grow or block the path.

---

### **Validation of the Path**

Each move was checked for collision with the snake’s body at that moment. The snake successfully reaches the apple at (7,1) after six moves without any self-collisions. This is the **shortest valid path** to the apple from the starting position.

  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [(8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)], to eat the apple at (7, 1).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
