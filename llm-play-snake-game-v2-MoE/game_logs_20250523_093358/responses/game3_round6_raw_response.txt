========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll help you plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple while avoiding collisions with walls or its body.

Let's analyze the current game state:

- Head position: (3, 6)
- Current direction: DOWN
- Body cells: [(3, 7)]
- Apple position: (9, 7)

First, let's determine how we can move from (3, 6) to (9, 7):

1. We need to move RIGHT 6 times (from x=3 to x=9)
2. We need to move UP 1 time (from y=6 to y=7)

Since the snake is currently moving DOWN, we can't immediately reverse direction and go UP. Let's analyze possible safe moves:

The first move must be either RIGHT or continue DOWN. However, if we keep going DOWN, we'll move away from the apple in the y-direction.

Let's plan a path:

1. Move RIGHT (to reach x=9)
2. Then move UP to adjust y

This is generally safe, but let's ensure at each step that:
- We don't collide with our body
- We stay within grid bounds
- After reaching apple, we have escape routes

Let's check for body collision as we go:

Starting from (3, 6):
1. RIGHT to (4, 6)
2. RIGHT to (5, 6)
3. RIGHT to (6, 6)
4. RIGHT to (7, 6)
5. RIGHT to (8, 6)
6. RIGHT to (9, 6)

Now at (9, 6), we need to move UP once to reach the apple at (9, 7):

7. UP to (9, 7) - We've reached the apple!

Now let's check if this path is safe:

- At each step, our body only has one segment and it doesn't interfere with our planned moves
- No wall collisions as we stay within bounds
- After reaching the apple at (9, 7), we have UP/DOWN/LEFT movement options

So the final plan of moves is:
1. RIGHT
2. RIGHT
3. RIGHT
4. RIGHT
5. RIGHT
6. RIGHT
7. UP

Let's format this as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move RIGHT six times to match the x-coordinate of the apple, then move UP once to match the y-coordinate. This path avoids body collision and stays within grid bounds."
}
```
