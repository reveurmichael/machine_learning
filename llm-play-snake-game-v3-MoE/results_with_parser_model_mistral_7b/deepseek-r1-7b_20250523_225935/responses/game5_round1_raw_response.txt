========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to help plan a path for the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (9,2). The snake is currently facing "NONE", which means it can choose any direction on the first move. But once it starts moving in a direction, say UP, it can't reverse immediately to DOWN unless it changes directions.

First, I'll visualize the grid. The snake's head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (9,2). So, from 5 to 9 on the x-axis is a distance of +4, which means moving right four times would be necessary if there were no obstacles. Similarly, from 5 to 2 on the y-axis is -3, so three moves down.

But since there's already a body behind the head (since the body list isn't empty), I have to ensure that my path doesn't cause any collisions with the snake's own body. The body cells are given as an empty list in the problem statement, which might be misleading because according to rule 2, the body is from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. But wait, no—the input for body cells is an ordered list that excludes the head and goes from BODY1 (nearest the head) to BODYN (the tail). So if the body list is empty, it means the snake has only a head and no body—so the body length is 0 or just the head? Wait, according to rule 4, the full snake S includes the head followed by BODY segments. If the body cells are empty, then the snake's body starts at the head with nothing behind.

But wait, in the initial state given, after moving, the body list would have one element—BODY1, which is the next segment. So if the input body is empty, that means the snake hasn't moved yet—it only has a head and no body segments because it's length 1.

Wait, but according to rule 2, the full snake S includes the head followed by BODY1, then BODY2, etc., so if the body list provided is empty, that would mean the snake has only a head—length 1. So in this case, since the apple is at (9,2), which is 4 units right and 3 units down from the head, I can directly move towards it without worrying about the body.

But the problem says "current direction: NONE"—so movement hasn't started yet, or any previous state? Wait, no—the initial position has a current direction of NONE. So perhaps on the first move, we can choose any direction except if reversing from the last, but since NONE is allowed to start, I have full freedom.

Wait, let me re-read: "current direction: 'NONE' — One of 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', or 'NONE'. So movement starts with current direction NONE. But according to rule 2 in movement updates, you cannot reverse if the previous was something else—so since it's NONE on first move, any is allowed.

But the problem states that body cells are empty—that would mean the snake is just at (5,5), so no collision issues yet because there's nothing behind. So I can plan a path towards (9,2) without worrying about self-collisions except when moving into the tail cell in subsequent steps if needed.

But wait, according to rule 3: "Cannot reverse direction on first move." But since NONE is allowed as first step and movement hasn't started yet, maybe that's not an issue here. So I can choose a path straight towards the apple without worrying about reversing immediately.

Let me plan the moves:

From (5,5), moving right four times to reach x=9. Then down three times to y=2.

So sequence would be RIGHT *4 and DOWN*3.

But wait, after each move, the snake's body shifts. So starting from (5,5) with no body—so when I move RIGHT to (6,5), the body becomes [(5,5)]. Then next move can't reverse direction if it was RIGHT before? Wait, initially, current direction is NONE.

So first move: let's choose RIGHT. New head at (6,5). No collision because body list is empty. So now, the snake's body is [(5,5)] added to front and tail removed—since we didn't eat apple. So new S is [ (6,5), (5,5) ].

But wait, after moving RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5):

- Insert old head at front of body: so new body list becomes [(5,5)].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element—tail was the previous head. Wait, no—the current direction is RIGHT, and in rule 3c if not eating apple, remove tail.

Wait, initial state:

Snake S = [ (5,5) ]? Or is it that with body cells empty, the snake's length is considered as just the head?

No, according to rule 1: The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, ..., BODYN], and each subsequent segment is adjacent. If the body list provided is empty, then the snake has only the head—so no body segments.

So initial state after input processing:

S = [ (5,5) ]?

Wait, but according to rule 2, body cells are the segments behind the head. So if there's nothing in the body list, it means the snake hasn't started moving yet, or has only a single segment—head and no body.

But let me think step by step:

Current state: head at (5,5), direction NONE, body cells empty.

So possible first move is any of RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN, or NONE. But since it's the start, NONE isn't useful—it can choose to move in any direction.

Suppose I plan to go right towards the apple—so choosing RIGHT.

After moving:

- New head (6,5)
- Check collision: no body cells, so safe.
- Update body: insert old head (5,5) at front. Then since not eating apple, remove tail—which was none because initial S only had the head. So new body is [ (5,5), (6,5) ]? Wait, that can't be—because when you move into a direction without eating, you just add the old head and drop the tail.

Wait no: rule 3 says:

- If not eating apple:
   - Insert old head at front of body.
   - Remove last element (tail).
   
So initial body is empty. After moving RIGHT:

- New head = (6,5)
- Check collision: safe
- Update body:
   - Prepend (5,5) to empty list → [ (5,5) ]
   - Since not eating apple, remove tail (the last element of the current body). But wait—the current body was empty. So after adding the new head at front, body is [(5,5)], then when removing tail because no apple eaten—then it's just [(5,5)]. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait no:

In rule 3: when moving without eating apple, you do:
a. Insert old head into front of body (so if previous body was empty, now the new body is [old head] plus any new inserts)
b. Then remove last element—the tail.

So after first move RIGHT from initial state with empty body:

- a. New body list becomes [(5,5)]
- b. Remove last → body becomes empty again?

Wait that doesn't make sense—it would mean the snake is back to length 1.

Hmm, perhaps my understanding of rule 3a and 3b is off. Let's re-express it:

When moving without eating apple:
   - Insert old head at front of body (adds one segment)
   - Then remove tail—so net change is +0: because you added one but removed one.

So if initial body was empty, after inserting old head (5,5) and then removing last element (which would be 5,5), the new body list becomes [ ] again. So the snake remains length 1.

But that can't be right—because in a normal move without eating apple, the snake should grow by one if it eats the apple but stay same size otherwise.

Wait rule 3:
   - If not eating apple: remove last element (tail)
   
So when you insert old head at front and then remove tail:

If initial body is empty after moving RIGHT:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Prepend old head (5,5) → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Then remove last element—so the body becomes empty again.

Thus, snake's S would be [new_head]. So no change in length—it remains 1.

But that seems contradictory because when you move to a new position without eating apple, you expect the body to stay at size N (if it was moving with apple) but if not, maybe stays same?

Wait perhaps rule 3 is:

When you move:
a. Insert old head into front of body → adds one
b. If no apple eaten: remove last element (tail)

Thus, net effect for a non-apple step is adding and removing—so the length remains same.

But in initial state where body was empty, after moving RIGHT:

- new_head = (6,5)
- Insert at front of empty list → [ (5,5) ]
- Then remove last element → body becomes empty

Thus, S would be [new_head], so no change—snake length 1.

But that's problematic because the next move cannot proceed without a valid position. So in this case, if I start with a single segment and move RIGHT to (6,5), then after step b, my snake is back to length 1 at (6,5). Which would cause issues on next move—since there's nowhere else to go unless the new head can be placed without overlapping.

Wait that can't happen—if the body list is empty, moving and inserting head again makes it [new_head], then removing tail keeps it as [new_head]. So snake remains length 1. Thus, each step where you don't eat apple just moves the snake forward but doesn't add any new body segments because you remove the old tail.

But that contradicts rule 3c—the removal of last element when not eating apple—so net effect is same length as before (since added one and removed one).

So in initial state, moving without eating:

S after move = [new_head], which is same as current head. But wait—if the snake was only at (5,5) with body empty, then inserting new_head (6,5), then removing last element gives S = [(6,5)], so no issue.

But in subsequent moves: each step just shifts position without adding any segments because you keep losing the tail as much as you add the head. Thus, if I have a snake of length 1 and can't add body unless it's an apple move—because otherwise, movement would result in snake not changing size.

Thus, perhaps moving towards the apple is possible but only by ensuring that after each step, when eating the apple, the snake grows.

But since the apple is at (9,2), which is four right and three down from (5,5)—it's unlikely to be on the path unless we have a body segment there.

Wait no—the problem states that the body cells are empty. So perhaps in this initial state, moving towards the apple without eating any bodies—so each step doesn't change the body length because you just move and remove the tail as you add the head.

But then to reach (9,2), which is four right and three down, it would take seven moves: 4 rights and 3 downs. But I can only do that without eating apple, so snake remains single cell each time.

That seems impossible because in this case, moving towards the apple wouldn't cause any body growth since no apple eaten—so after several steps, you just shift position but never get closer to a body segment.

Wait perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe if the snake's body cells are empty, meaning that it has only one cell (the head), then when you move, you can choose to eat an apple in any of those positions? But the problem says "current direction: NONE"—so no direction yet—perhaps movement hasn't started.

Alternatively, maybe I misread. The initial state is:

- Current position: head at (5,5)
- Body cells: empty
- Direction: NONE

So perhaps it's allowed to move without any constraints of body segments because the snake hasn't moved yet.

But that seems unlikely—since if you have a single cell, moving would require no collision with itself. Since there is nothing behind or in front except for where you're moving.

Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

The problem says: "Body cells" are given as an empty list—but according to the rules, body cells represent the segments from behind head (immediately) up to tail. So if body list is empty, snake has only a head—length 1.

Thus, in that case, movement can be done freely without worrying about collision with body because there's nothing behind or in front except where you're moving.

Wait no—the rule says:

In the first step when direction is NONE and movement hasn't started yet—it would have S as [head], so new head added at move—then according to rule 3a: insert old head into front of body. If initial body was empty, after inserting, it becomes [old_head]. Then in rule 3b: if not eating apple, remove last element → which is now just the first (and only) element—so the new body is empty again.

Thus, S would be [new_head], so same as before movement. So no change—that can't happen because that would make each move a loop.

This suggests that perhaps when direction is NONE and there's no body cells provided, the snake hasn't started moving yet—so you have to plan your moves with the understanding that until you eat an apple or something else changes, you just shift position but don't add any new segments.

But this seems contradictory because each move without eating would require adding a segment then removing it—a net change of zero. Thus, perhaps when direction is NONE and body list is empty, the snake can only be moved in one direction until it eats an apple or something else changes.

Alternatively, maybe "current direction: none" allows movement towards any direction regardless of the body's current state—so you don't have to worry about self-collision because there's no previous movement.

But this seems unclear. I think perhaps it's better to assume that since the snake hasn't moved yet (current direction is NONE) and has only a head, moving towards apple is possible as long as each step doesn't cause collision with its own body or tail position.

Given all that, perhaps choosing RIGHT four times first would get me closer. So:

Move 1: Right to (6,5)
Check for self-collision: initial state had S = [ (5,5) ], after moving:
- new_head = (6,5)
- insert into front of empty body → [ (5,5) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element → [ ] again. So now S is [ (6,5) ]

Move 2: Right to (7,5)
Same process: after move:
- new_head = (7,5)
- insert into front of empty body → [ (6,5) ]
- not eating apple, remove last element → [ ] again. So now S is [ (7,5) ]

Wait but this doesn't make sense—each time you move without eating, the snake's length reduces to 1 again.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting rule 3a and 3b. Maybe when not eating apple:

- Insert old head at front of body → new body is [old_head] + current body
- Then remove last element (tail) only if it exists

So in the initial state with empty body after moving RIGHT once:

new_body = [ (5,5) ] before removing tail. Then you drop the tail: but since there's no tail yet? Or does "last" refer to the current body?

Wait rule 3 says:
   - If not eating apple, then:
      a. Insert old head at front of body.
      b. Remove last element.

So if after inserting new_head and adding it as first element in an empty list, you now have [old_head]. Then step b is to remove the last element—so the body becomes [ ] again.

Thus, each move where you don't eat apple just shifts your position but keeps the snake at length 1. So moving towards the apple without eating would keep it as a single cell.

But in that case, how can you reach (9,2) if you're stuck on length 1? Each step is only changing head position without adding any body segments because after each move, you just have [new_head] and then remove last to get back.

This seems like an impossibility. So perhaps my initial assumption about the direction or movement is wrong—maybe I can choose a different path that requires eating apple at some point?

Wait but in this case, there's no body cells provided as empty list—but wait, maybe body list being empty indicates that snake hasn't started moving yet (i.e., only head exists). So when you move without eating any apple, you just add the old_head and then remove tail—so it remains at length 1.

But in this case, to reach (9,2), which is four right and three down from initial position: perhaps after each move, I can eat an apple somewhere along the path? But since body list isn't provided as non-empty, maybe there's no existing body segments—so apples are at some positions. Wait but problem doesn't specify any apple on the board except for the one given in input.

Wait no—the input specifies that "body cells" is empty; so perhaps it's implying that the only apple is the target (9,2). Thus, unless you can reach (9,2) by moving without ever stepping on a body cell, which isn't possible because snake doesn't have any body yet—so moving along path towards (9,2), but since each step just shifts position and removes tail.

But that suggests that the only way to progress is to eat apple at some point. But wait, the problem says "current direction: NONE"—so maybe I can choose to make a turn immediately without worrying about previous direction? Or perhaps move in any direction without reversing.

Wait since current direction is none, which means no prior movement—so moving in any direction is allowed (rule 2: cannot reverse if last step was not none). But as first step, you can go any direction.

So to reach apple at (9,2), maybe I need to make a series of moves towards it without eating apple until necessary.

But given that each non-apple move just shifts position and removes the tail—snake remains length 1—it's impossible. Thus, perhaps only way is to eat an apple along the path—but problem says "current direction: none"—so no previous movement.

Wait maybe I can eat a virtual apple somewhere? No—the problem seems to imply that body cells are physical positions of the snake's body.

Alternatively, maybe in this initial state, since the snake hasn't moved yet (direction is NONE), moving towards any direction and then "eating" an imaginary apple allows it to grow. But no—problem says body cells are empty; so perhaps there's only one cell with head and no body segments.

In that case, movement can be done without worrying about body because there's nothing else—it'll just keep shifting position but not changing the fact of having only a single segment.

Wait I'm getting stuck here. Maybe my approach is wrong—perhaps when the snake hasn't moved (current direction NONE), each move towards any direction will cause it to grow, since after moving and adding head, you insert into front of empty body then remove tail—which for an empty list just leaves S as [new_head].

But this would mean that if I keep moving in same direction without eating apple, the snake remains length 1.

Thus, perhaps the only way is to eat apple at some point along the path—so when you get close enough to a body segment (the head), you can move towards it and "eat" it. But since initial position has no body segments except for head, that's not helpful.

Wait but in this case, if I'm allowed to choose any direction without worrying about previous movement, maybe I should first create some body segments by moving into apple positions? Wait the problem doesn't specify any apples other than the target at (9,2).

This is getting too confusing. Maybe a different approach: think of the snake as being able to move in straight line until it hits an obstacle or must turn.

But since there's no obstacles mentioned and body list is empty except for head, perhaps moving directly towards apple without any issues—each step just shifts position but doesn't affect body length because after each movement, you lose tail but gain head. Thus, the snake remains single cell.

Wait but that would mean it's impossible to reach (9,2) since it can only be a single cell in size. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something about the rules or problem setup.

Alternatively, maybe when direction is NONE and body cells are empty, movement isn't constrained by self-collision—it's allowed to move anywhere without worrying because there’s no previous position.

If that's the case, then moving towards (9,2) would be possible as a straight line—each step just shifts head position. So it takes 4 rights and 3 downs: 7 moves in total.

But since body cells are empty except for head, each move doesn't cause collision with any other parts of the snake because there's nothing behind or in front except where you're moving.

Thus, perhaps the minimal path is to take four rights then three downs—total seven moves—but since after each movement without eating apple, the snake remains a single cell, so this isn't possible. Thus, probably my initial approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe when body cells are empty and direction is NONE, it's allowed to move in any straight line regardless of self-collision because no prior position exists—so can directly go towards target without issues.

Assuming that, the minimal path would be 7 moves: four rights then three downs. So directions would be RRRRDD (or some variation depending on order).

But since each move just shifts the head and body remains single cell, I don't see how it's possible to reach apple at (9,2). Maybe the snake can magically grow in this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps "current direction: none" allows movement without considering self-collision. So you can directly proceed towards target with no issues.

In that case, directions would be RRRRDD—four rights then three downs.

But I'm still not sure how body length is maintained when moving like that—it's unclear.

Maybe the answer is to move four times right and three times down in any order without worrying about self-collision. So the sequence could be R R R R D D D, for example.

Thus, despite the confusion, probably the intended path is straightforward straight line towards apple: right 4 times then down 3 times.
</think>

To reach the apple located at (9,2) from the starting position (5,5), you should move in a straight line without turning. Since each movement doesn't cause self-collision and there are no body segments to interfere, proceed by moving right four times followed by three downward moves.

Step-by-step directions:
1. Move Right 4 times.
2. Move Down 3 times.

Total Directions: RRRRDD

$\boxed{RRRDD}$

Wait, the total steps would be seven (4R and 3D), but in terms of minimal direction changes, perhaps you can write it as RRRRDD or any combination that reaches destination without reversing directions. But since current direction is NONE, no reversal is needed.

But for exactness, let me recount:

From (5,5) to (9,2):
- Change x-coordinate from 5 to 9: +4 → 4 Rights.
- Change y-coordinate from 5 to 2: -3 → 3 Downs.

Thus, directions are RRRRDD. Alternatively, can combine the steps without worrying about order as per problem's freedom in movement when current direction is none.

But perhaps due to body cells being empty and direction NONE, any sequence of rights followed by downs will work—so minimal unique path would be R then D multiple times, but since we need exact directions, probably answer is four R then three D:

RRRDD (but only six moves; wait 4R+3D=7)

Wait the correct number is seven steps: RRRRDD.

But in terms of direction changes, it's just moving right and down without turning. So final answer would be R followed by D but more accurately four rights then three downs:

$\boxed{RRRRDD}$

Alternatively:

$\boxed{R \times 4 + D \times 3}$
