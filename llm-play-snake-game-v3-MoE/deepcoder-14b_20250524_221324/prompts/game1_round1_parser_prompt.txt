<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this Snake problem where the head is at (5,5) and the apple is at (7,6). The snake's body is empty right now, which means it's just the head with no segments behind. The current direction is NONE, so any first move is allowed.

First, I need to understand the movement rules. The snake can't reverse its direction immediately. Since the current direction is NONE, the first move can be any of UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But after that, it can't go in the opposite direction. For example, if it moves RIGHT first, then next it can't go LEFT.

The goal is to get from (5,5) to (7,6). Looking at the coordinates, the head needs to move 2 steps to the right (x increases by 2) and 1 step up (y increases by 1). So ideally, I'd want a path that does that without any unnecessary moves.

Let me think about possible paths. The most straightforward way would be to go RIGHT twice and then UP once. That would take us directly to the apple in three moves: RIGHT, RIGHT, UP.

But wait, since the snake is length 1 (no body segments), moving this way shouldn't cause any collisions with its own body because there's nothing behind it. Also, after eating the apple, the body grows by one segment. So after the first move, the body would be [(5,5), ...], but wait no—the initial body is empty, so after the first move, the body would have the old head position.

Wait, let me clarify: when you make a move, the new head is computed, then if there's no collision, the body updates. Since initially, the body is empty, after moving RIGHT once, the body would be [ (5,5) ] and the head would be at (6,5). Then another RIGHT to (7,5), and then UP to (7,6).

But I also need to make sure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move next turn. But since in this case, we're directly moving towards the apple without any obstacles, maybe that's not an issue here.

Wait, no, after eating the apple, the body grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't move. So let me simulate each step:

Initial state:
- Head: (5,5)
- Body: []
- Direction: NONE

First move: RIGHT
New head: (6,5). Check for collisions—no body segments, and it's within bounds.
Update body: insert old head (5,5) at front. Since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail (which doesn't exist because body is empty), so body remains empty? Wait no—the body was empty, but after moving, the new body would be [ (5,5) ] because we added the old head and then removed the tail (but there was none). So now the body has one segment: [(5,5)].

Wait, wait. Let me refer back to the movement rules:

When you move normally (not eating apple), after inserting the old head into the body list, you remove the last element of the body (the tail) if it's not an apple. But in this first move, since the body was empty, adding the old head and then removing the tail (which doesn't exist) would leave the body as [ (5,5) ]? Or maybe no—because when you insert the old head at the front, the body becomes [ (5,5) ], but since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the last element. But if the body was empty before, inserting makes it have one element, then removing would leave it empty again?

Wait, let's go step by step:

1. Compute new head: (6,5).
2. Check collision: no.
3. Update body:
   a. Insert old head (5,5) at front of BODY list. So now BODY is [ (5,5) ].
   b. Since new_head != apple position (assuming the apple is at (7,6)), we don't grow. So remove last element of BODY. But since after inserting, the body is [ (5,5) ], removing the last element would make it empty again.
4. Set HEAD to (6,5).

So after first move:
- Head: (6,5)
- Body: []
Wait, that can't be right because we added the old head and then removed the tail, but if the body was empty before, inserting makes it [ (5,5) ], then removing the last element (which is (5,5)) would leave the body as empty. So after first move, body remains empty? That doesn't make sense because when you grow, you add a segment.

Wait no—when you don't eat an apple, you remove the tail. But if there's nothing to remove (body was empty), then nothing happens. Wait no—the movement rules say:

If new_head != apple position:
   Remove last element of BODY (the tail) so total length remains same.

But initial body is empty, after inserting old head, it has one element. Then you have to remove the last element (tail). So after step 3b, the body would be empty again? That doesn't make sense because that's how the snake moves—each move shifts the body segments forward, but if there are no segments, then adding and removing leaves nothing.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. When the body is empty, inserting the old head at step 3a makes the body [ (5,5) ]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, in step 3c, you remove the last element of the body (which is (5,5)), so the body becomes empty again.

Wait that can't be right because then the snake would just have a head and no body. But that's not possible—the body should follow. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body updates when it's empty.

Alternatively, perhaps when the body is empty, after inserting the old head, you don't remove anything because there's nothing to remove. Wait no—the rule says: if new_head != apple, then remove last element of BODY (the tail). If the body was empty before step 3a, after inserting it has one element, which would be the old head at (5,5). Then you have to remove the tail—so in this case, since there's only one element, removing it leaves an empty list.

Wait that can't be correct because then the snake would lose its body segments each time. So perhaps when the body is empty, after inserting the old head, you don't remove anything because there's no tail to remove.

Wait looking back at the movement rules:

3. Update body positions (assuming no collision and within bounds):
   a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1).
   b. If new_head == apple position, grow: do not remove the tail this turn.
   c. Otherwise, move normally: remove the last element of BODY (the tail) so total length remains same.

So in the first move:

After step 3a, body is [ (5,5) ] (since it was empty before).
Since new_head != apple, we do step 3c: remove last element. The last element is (5,5), so body becomes empty again.

Wait that's strange—so after moving, the snake only has a head and no body segments? That can't be right because in the next move, when you try to move again, you have to make sure that the new head doesn't collide with any BODYi except possibly the tail. But if there are no BODY segments, then it's safe.

Wait but after first move:
- Head is at (6,5)
- Body is empty because we added (5,5) and then removed it.

So in the next move, moving again would have a body that's empty except for the new head. So perhaps this is allowed.

But wait, let me think about the second step:

After first move:
Head: (6,5)
Body: []
Direction: RIGHT

Second move: RIGHT again.
New head: (7,5).
Check collision: no, since body is empty.
Update body:
a. Insert old head (6,5) at front of BODY → [ (6,5) ]
b. new_head != apple, so remove last element → body becomes empty.

So after second move:
Head: (7,5)
Body: []

Third move: UP
New head: (7,6).
Check collision: no.
Update body:
a. Insert old head (7,5) at front → [ (7,5) ]
b. new_head == apple position (since apple is at (7,6)).

Wait wait no—the apple is at (7,6), and the new head after third move would be (7,6). So yes, it's equal to the apple.

So step 3:
a. Insert old head (7,5) → body becomes [ (7,5) ]
b. Since new_head == apple, do not remove tail. But since the body was empty before inserting, after inserting, the body is [ (7,5) ], and we don't remove anything because we're growing.

So now, the body remains as [ (7,5) ].

Wait no—the initial body after second move was empty, then in third step:

After moving UP:
- Insert old head (7,5) at front → body becomes [ (7,5) ]
- Since new_head is apple, do not remove tail. So the body remains [ (7,5) ].

So now, the full snake S is:
Head: (7,6)
Body: [ (7,5) ]

But wait, according to the representation:

The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, ..., BODYN]. So in this case, after eating the apple, the body would be [ (7,5) ].

Now, after that, direction can't reverse. Next move can't be DOWN because previous was UP? Wait no—the last movement was UP, so next can't be DOWN. But since we've reached the apple, perhaps we don't need to make any more moves.

But the question is about whether this path works without causing any collisions or issues.

Wait but let's check each step:

1. Move RIGHT: from (5,5) → (6,5). Body becomes empty after.
2. Move RIGHT again: (6,5) → (7,5). Body becomes empty again after.
3. Move UP: (7,5) → (7,6). Now body is [ (7,5) ].

So in this case, the body has one segment at (7,5), and the head is at (7,6). So no collision because the new head is not part of any BODYi except if it's the tail when growing. But since we grew by adding the old head, which was (7,5) in this case, and then didn't remove anything.

Wait but after third move:

Head: (7,6)
Body: [ (7,5) ]

So the body is one segment behind the head. So no collision because the new head isn't overlapping with any body segments except if it's the tail when growing. But in this case, since we didn't have a previous collision, it should be okay.

But wait, when you move UP from (7,5) to (7,6), the old head was (7,5). So inserting that into the body makes the body [ (7,5) ], and since we ate the apple, we don't remove anything. So the body has one segment at (7,5), which is directly below the new head.

But does this cause any collision? The rules say:

Check for collisions with any BODYi except when it's the tail in the case of growing. Wait no—the collision check is done before updating the body. So when computing the new head, you have to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any existing body segments.

Wait looking back at the movement rules:

After computing the new head, step 2 says: Check for collisions with any part of the body (including itself if it's a multi-segment snake). If collision exists, move is invalid.

In this case, when moving from (7,5) to (7,6), the old body was empty. So after computing new head (7,6), we check if it collides with any existing body segments. Since the body is empty before the move, there's nothing to collide with. Then, after moving, we add the old head (7,5) and since we ate the apple, we don't remove anything.

So the final state would have:

- Head: (7,6)
- Body: [ (7,5) ]

No collisions occurred during any of these steps because in each move, the new head didn't overlap with any existing body segments (since they were empty or non-overlapping).

Therefore, this path should work.

Another possible path could be going UP first, then RIGHT twice. But since we need to go up only once and right twice, it's more efficient to do the two rights first and then the up.

Wait no—let me see:

If I go UP first, from (5,5) → (5,6), then two RIGHTS: (6,6), (7,6). That would also reach the apple but requires three moves as well. The order doesn't matter in terms of number of steps, but perhaps one path is more collision-free.

But in both cases, since there are no body segments initially, neither path would cause any collisions. However, after eating the apple, if we have a longer body, maybe that could affect future movements, but since we're only making three moves and then stopping, it's not an issue here.

Wait no—the problem doesn't specify whether the snake continues moving or stops after reaching the apple. I think once the head is at (7,6), we've reached the goal, so the movement sequence can stop there.

But perhaps a more efficient path exists? No, both paths require three moves.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, the body grows by one segment. So in this case, if we take the first path (RIGHT, RIGHT, UP), after the third move, the body is [ (7,5) ] and head at (7,6). If we then had to make another move, say DOWN, it would collide with the body segment at (7,5). But since we don't need to make any more moves, this isn't a problem.

So overall, the path of RIGHT, RIGHT, UP should work without any collisions and reach the apple in three moves.

Wait but let's make sure that after each move, there are no self-collisions:

1. Move 1: RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5). Body was empty, so no collision.
2. Move 2: RIGHT again to (7,5). Still no body segments except old ones which were removed, so no collision.
3. Move 3: UP to (7,6). After this move, the body has one segment at (7,5), but since we added it after moving and didn't have any prior body segments during the collision check, there's no collision.

Yes, that should work.

Alternatively, another possible path could be RIGHT, UP, RIGHT. Let me see:

Move 1: RIGHT to (6,5). Body becomes empty.
Move 2: UP from (6,5) to (6,6). Check for collisions—no body segments.
Update body: insert old head (6,5), then remove it since not eating apple. So body remains empty.

Wait no—the movement rules:

After moving UP:
- New head is (6,6)
- Body was empty before inserting. After step 3a, body is [ (6,5) ].
- Since new_head != apple (apple at (7,6)), remove last element → body becomes empty again.

So after second move, body is empty.

Third move: RIGHT to (7,6). Check collision—no body segments. Then insert old head (6,6), and since we ate the apple, do not remove anything. So body becomes [ (6,6) ].

Wait no—the new head is (7,6). The old head before moving was (6,6). Wait wait:

Wait, after second move:
- Head: (6,6)
- Body: empty

Third move: RIGHT from (6,6) → (7,6).
Check collision: body is empty, so no problem.
Update body:
a. Insert old head (6,6) at front → [ (6,6) ]
b. new_head == apple? Yes, because the apple is at (7,6). Wait wait no—the new head is (7,6), and the apple is also at (7,6). So yes.

Wait no: in this path, after third move, head is at (7,6), which is where the apple is. So step 3:

a. Insert old head (6,6) → body becomes [ (6,6) ]
b. Since new_head == apple, do not remove tail.

So body remains [ (6,6) ] after this move.

But wait, in this case, the body segment is at (6,6), and the head is at (7,6). So there's no collision because they're different coordinates.

Wait but I'm confused. The apple is at (7,6), so when you move to that position, you eat it. Then the body updates:

- Insert old head (6,6) → [ (6,6) ]
- Don't remove tail.

So the full snake would be:
Head: (7,6)
Body: [ (6,6) ]

No collision because the new head is at (7,6), and the only body segment is at (6,6).

Wait no—the movement step:

When you compute the new head, it's (7,6). Then you check if any of your existing body parts are in that position. Since the body was empty before this move, there's nothing to collide with.

So both paths—RIGHT twice then UP, or RIGHT once, UP, RIGHT—are valid and result in reaching the apple without collisions.

But perhaps the first path (two rights then up) is more straightforward.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, if we have a body segment behind, it might restrict movement in certain ways if there were more steps, but since we're done here, it's not an issue.

So the minimal number of moves required is three: two rights and one up, or any other combination that achieves the same delta.

Therefore, the answer should be a sequence like RIGHT, RIGHT, UP.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple by moving right twice and then up once. This path avoids collisions and efficiently reaches the target in three moves.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **First Move: Right**  
   - Head moves from (5,5) to (6,5). No body segments to collide with.
   
2. **Second Move: Right Again**  
   - Head moves from (6,5) to (7,5). Body remains empty after this move.

3. **Third Move: Up**  
   - Head moves from (7,5) to (7,6), reaching the apple's position. The body updates by adding the old head at (7,5), and since the apple is eaten, no segment is removed, leaving one body segment behind.

This sequence ensures no collisions with the body and successfully reaches the apple in three moves.
