========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (9,7) with direction RIGHT. To reach the apple at (5,7), the snake needs to move left 4 times (net horizontal) and stay vertical (net vertical). First, moving UP avoids collision and positions the head to access the vertical body segment. Moving UP again positions the head above the body's vertical column. Then, moving LEFT four times navigates along the top of the body, avoiding collisions. Finally, moving DOWN twice reaches the apple at (5,7). This path ensures no collisions with the body or walls and leaves a legal move after eating the apple."
