========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (8,7), and the apple is at (8,5). I need to find a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds.

First, let's look at the current direction, which is "RIGHT". Since the snake can't reverse direction immediately, the next move cannot be "LEFT" because that would reverse the direction. So possible moves are "UP", "DOWN", or stay in "RIGHT".

The head is currently at (8,7). The apple is two units down on the same x-coordinate. So to reach it, the snake needs to move down twice.

But wait, moving directly down might cause a collision with its body. Let's check the body segments: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]. These are all along y=7 except for (2,6) and (2,5). The tail is at (2,5).

If the snake moves down once to (8,6), that's safe because it doesn't collide with any body parts. Then moving down again to (8,5) should be fine since after the first move, the body shifts.

Let me simulate the first move: "DOWN". The new head is at (8,6). No collision here. Then the body updates by adding the old head (8,7) to the front of the body list and removing the tail if it's not an apple. Since we're not eating an apple, the tail will be removed.

After moving "DOWN", the body becomes [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6)]. So no collision is possible on the next move because when we go down again to (8,5), it's not in the new body list.

Another consideration: after eating the apple at (8,5), the snake grows. We need to ensure that there's a legal move afterward. After growing, the body will be longer, but as long as the head has space to move further without hitting itself, it should be fine.

I think moving down twice is the safest and shortest path here. It avoids any potential collisions and meets all movement rules.

{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves directly downward two times to reach the apple at (8,5) without colliding with its body or going out of bounds."
