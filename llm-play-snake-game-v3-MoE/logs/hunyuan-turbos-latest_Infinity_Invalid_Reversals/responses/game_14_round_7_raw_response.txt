{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The apple is directly to the left of the head, and the snake's body is aligned vertically behind the head. Moving left repeatedly will allow the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its body, as the body segments will shift upward with each move."
