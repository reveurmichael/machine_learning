========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 4 LEFT (to reduce x from 5 to 1) and 2 UP (to increase y from 2 to 4). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing direction (current direction is DOWN). Each move is checked for collisions with the body, which shifts safely as the tail moves (except when eating the apple). The final move reaches the apple, and post-move, there are legal next moves (e.g., UP, DOWN, LEFT) to avoid trapping."
