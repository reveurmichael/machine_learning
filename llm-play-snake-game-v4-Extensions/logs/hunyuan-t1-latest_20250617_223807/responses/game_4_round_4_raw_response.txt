{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move down 5 times to reach the apple at (9,1) from (9,6). Each downward move avoids collisions with the body (which shifts upward as the snake moves) and stays within grid bounds. After the final move to eat the apple, there is still a legal move (e.g., DOWN to (9,0)) to avoid trapping."
