<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (3,1), and the apple is at (9,8). I need to figure out a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with itself or the walls.

First, I'll note the current state:

- Head: (3,1)
- Direction: DOWN
- Body cells: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]
- Apple: (9,8)

The snake is currently moving downward. Since the body follows behind, each move must ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail in some cases.

The goal is to get from (3,1) to (9,8). The Manhattan distance is |9-3| + |8-1| = 6 +7=13. So, I need a path that covers these moves without causing collisions.

Looking at the current direction, since it's DOWN, the next move can't be UP because of rule 2 (can't reverse direction). But for the first move, wait: no, the current direction is DOWN, so next move cannot be UP. Wait, no—the rule says you can't reverse. So if current is DOWN, next can't be UP.

Wait, correction: The movement rules state that you can't choose the opposite direction of the current direction. Since current is DOWN, next move can't be UP. So from DOWN, possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again? Wait no—each move must change direction unless it's NONE. Wait, I think in each step, you can choose any direction except the opposite of the current direction.

Wait, the movement rules state: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for others. So if current is DOWN, next move can't be UP. But it's allowed to stay in the same direction or choose other directions except the opposite.

So from DOWN, possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But initially, the snake is moving DOWN, so first move can't be UP. Let me see.

The head is at (3,1). The body is behind it: (3,2), (3,3), etc., down to (3,5). So currently, the snake is in a vertical line along x=3 from y=1 to y=5.

The apple is at (9,8). To get there, the snake needs to move right several times and up several times. But since it's starting by moving DOWN, perhaps the first moves should adjust direction towards the target.

Wait, the head is at (3,1), which is near the bottom-left. The apple is at top-right (9,8). So the snake needs to go mostly right and then up.

But currently, the snake is moving down. So first move can't be UP, but maybe it should start by turning left or right or continue down.

Wait, let's think about possible moves:

Current direction: DOWN. Next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (but if it continues to go DOWN, it'll hit the bottom wall eventually because y can't go below 0. So perhaps that's not a good idea.

Alternatively, turning LEFT would take the head from (3,1) to (2,1). Then next move could be UP or other directions.

But let's consider what the body will do after each move.

If I choose to turn RIGHT first, moving from (3,1) to (4,1). But looking at the current body: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]. So if head moves right to (4,1), then the new body would be [old_head (3,1)] + existing body. Then remove the tail unless we eat an apple.

Wait, but after moving, the body shifts. So for each move:

- The new head is computed.
- Check collision: can't collide with any body except possibly the tail in specific cases.
- Update body by adding old head to front and removing tail unless eating apple.

In this case, since we're not near the apple yet, each move would shift the body normally.

So let's plan a path:

1. Start at (3,1), direction DOWN.

Move 1: Since current is DOWN, can't go UP. Let's choose to turn RIGHT, moving to (4,1). Then, the body becomes [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)], and tail is removed, so body is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)].

Wait no: after inserting old head at front, body becomes [old_head] + existing body. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element.

So after moving RIGHT:

new_head = (4,1).

Check collision: new_head is within bounds and doesn't collide with any body cells except possibly the tail in this step. The current body is [(3,2), ...], so no collision.

Then update body: insert old head (3,1) at front → [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] becomes the new body after insertion? Wait, no. The initial body is [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]. When moving, we add old head to front, making it [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ], and then remove the tail if not eating apple. Since we're not eating apple yet, the body becomes [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ].

So new head is (4,1), body is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)].

Wait, no. Because when you move, the old head becomes the first element of the body. So after moving, the body list is updated to [old_head] + existing_body[:-1], because tail is removed unless eating apple.

So in this case, new_head is (4,1), and the new body is [ (3,1) ] + [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ], making it four elements. So the snake's length remains 5? Wait no: initial body was 4 segments plus head makes total length 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The full snake S is [HEAD] + BODY list. Each move, new_head is computed. Then, insert old head into front of the BODY list (BODY becomes [old_head] + BODY). If not eating apple, remove last element (tail) from the new BODY.

So in initial state, S = [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)].

When moving to (4,1):

new_head is (4,1). Then, insert old head (3,1) into front of BODY → [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ].

Then, remove last element unless eating apple. Since not eating, new body is [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ].

So S becomes [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)].

Wait no: wait, the initial head was (3,1). The body is [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ].

After moving RIGHT to (4,1):

- new_head = (4,1)
- insert old head (3,1) into front of BODY → [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element: [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ]

So the new body is [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ].

Thus, S becomes [(4,1)] + [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ] → total 5 segments: head and four body parts.

Wait no: the body list is now of length 4. So the snake's length remains the same? Or does it grow if needed.

Wait, in movement rules:

- If new_head == apple position, grow by not removing tail.
- Else, remove last element (move normally).

In this case, we're not eating an apple yet, so after inserting old head and then removing tail, body length remains the same as before? Let me see: initial body was 4 elements. After inserting, it's 5, then removing, back to 4.

So the snake's total segments (head + body) are now 1 +4 =5, same as before.

Wait, but in movement example, when moving normally, after inserting old head and removing tail, the body length remains the same.

Yes. So the snake doesn't grow unless it eats an apple.

Therefore, each normal move shifts the body without changing its length.

So back to planning.

From (3,1), direction is DOWN. Can't go UP. Let's consider possible moves:

Option 1: Move RIGHT to (4,1). Then, next moves can be planned towards the apple.

But let's see what's ahead.

After moving right to (4,1), the body is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]. Next move could be up or down or left/right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first adjust direction and then proceed towards the apple.

Wait, but I'm getting bogged down. Let me think about a possible path:

The target is (9,8). So x increases from 3 to 9 (difference of +6), y increases from 1 to 8 (difference of +7).

So the snake needs to make mostly right and up moves.

But starting at (3,1) moving down, perhaps we should first move left or right.

Wait, but initial direction is DOWN. So after moving, the new head is either LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

If I choose to go RIGHT: new head (4,1). Then next move could be UP to start moving towards y=8.

But let's see:

Move 1: RIGHT → (4,1)

Body: [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ]

Move 2: Can't go DOWN again because that would take it further away. Alternatively, move UP to start moving towards the target.

Wait, but from (4,1), moving UP would go to (4,2). Then, check collision with body.

The body after first move is [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ].

So moving up to (4,2):

new_head = (4,2)

Check collision: new_head is at (4,2). The body is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]. None of these are at (4,2), so no collision.

Then update body:

Insert old head (4,1) into front → [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) ]

So new body is [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]

Wait, but that's only 4 segments. But initial after first move was also 4.

This seems complicated. Maybe it's better to plan a series of moves where the snake turns towards the target and proceeds without collision.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a square pattern or some other way.

Another approach: The current body is along x=3 from y=1 to y=5. To reach (9,8), which is far right and up, perhaps we should first move away from the initial column and then proceed.

But considering that each move must not collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail in some cases, it's essential to plan moves where new head doesn't land on any existing body cells.

Given that, let's consider moving right several times to get out of the initial column.

But perhaps a better approach is to simulate possible moves step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps an efficient path would be:

Move RIGHT multiple times until x=9, then move UP.

But since each move can only change direction in certain ways (can't reverse), and considering current direction, let's plan:

Move 1: RIGHT → (4,1)

Move 2: UP → (4,2)

Move 3: UP → (4,3)

...

Continue moving UP until y=8.

But wait, from (4,1), moving up to (4,2) is allowed. Then from there, move right towards x=9.

Wait, but how many moves would that take?

From y=1 to y=8: 7 steps up.

From x=3 to x=9: 6 steps right.

But considering the initial position and direction, perhaps a better path exists.

Alternatively, let's think about moving in a spiral or other patterns to avoid collision.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to plan moves as follows:

1. Move RIGHT until x=9 (6 moves right)

2. Then move UP 7 times to reach y=8

But each time changing direction carefully.

But we need to consider the body after each move to ensure no collisions.

Alternatively, let's think about a possible path that zigzags towards the target without colliding with itself.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to find an optimal path or at least a valid one.

Another approach: since the snake can't collide with its body (except possibly in some cases), we need to make sure that each new head position is not occupied by any part of the current body except maybe the tail, but even then, only in certain conditions.

But perhaps an easier way is to plan a path where the snake moves right as much as possible, then up.

Given that, let's outline the steps:

1. From (3,1), move RIGHT to (4,1). Now, body is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]

Wait no: after moving right, body becomes [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ].

So S is [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)].

Wait, but that's 5 segments. So the snake has moved right, and the body now includes its previous position as part of the body.

But moving further:

Move 2: from (4,1), can move RIGHT again to (5,1). Check collision: body is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]. So new_head (5,1) doesn't collide. Update body: insert old head (4,1) into front → [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ], then remove last element (since not eating apple): [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) ].

So new body is [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)].

Move 3: from (5,1), move RIGHT to (6,1). Check collision with body [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]. No collision. Update body: insert old head (5,1) → [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) ], then remove last element → [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) ].

Move 4: from (6,1), move RIGHT to (7,1). Check body [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]. No collision. Body becomes [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ].

Move 5: from (7,1), move RIGHT to (8,1). Check body [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]. No collision. Body becomes [ (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) ].

Move 6: from (8,1), move RIGHT to (9,1). Check body [(7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]. No collision. Body becomes [ (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1) ].

Now, head is at (9,1). Next move can be to start moving up towards y=8.

Move 7: from (9,1), direction was RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT. Let's choose UP → (9,2).

Check collision with body [(8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1)]. No collision at (9,2). Update body: insert old head (9,1) into front → [ (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1) ], then remove last element → [ (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1) ].

Move 8: from (9,2), move UP to (9,3). Check body [(9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1)]. No collision. Body becomes [ (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (7,1) ].

Move 9: from (9,3), move UP to (9,4). Check body [(9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (7,1)]. No collision. Body becomes [ (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1) ].

Move 10: from (9,4), move UP to (9,5). Check body [(9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1)]. No collision. Body becomes [ (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1) ].

Move 11: from (9,5), move UP to (9,6). Check body [(9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1)]. No collision. Body becomes [ (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2) ].

Move 12: from (9,6), move UP to (9,7). Check body [(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)]. No collision. Body becomes [ (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3) ].

Move 13: from (9,7), move UP to (9,8). Now at target! Check body [(9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3)]. No collision. Update body: insert old head (9,7) into front → [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3) ], then remove last element → [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) ].

So total moves: 13. But this is a lot of moves, and perhaps we can optimize.

Wait, but in the above plan, after moving right to x=9, we moved up step by step. Each move after that required changing direction from RIGHT to UP, which is allowed as it's not reversing.

But maybe there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, after reaching (9,1), instead of moving straight up, perhaps turn left or right and find a shorter path.

Wait, but the target is directly above at (9,8), so moving straight up seems necessary.

Another thought: After each move to the right, perhaps sometimes turning up can allow for earlier movement towards y=8.

But given that the snake's body extends behind it, we need to make sure that when moving up, the new head doesn't land on any part of the current body.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to spiral inward or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: move right until x=9, then up. As above, this took 13 moves, but perhaps we can do it in fewer steps by moving diagonally? No, because each move is either horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.

Alternatively, consider that after moving right to (9,1), the body is behind from (8,1) back to the original position. So when starting to move up, as long as we don't collide with the body parts below, it's safe.

But perhaps there are ways to overlap some moves.

Wait, maybe not necessary. The initial plan of moving right 6 times and then up 7 times seems logical, resulting in 13 moves.

But I think that's a valid path, even if lengthy.

So, to summarize the moves:

1. RIGHT
2. RIGHT
3. RIGHT
4. RIGHT
5. RIGHT
6. RIGHT → now at (9,1)
7. UP
8. UP
9. UP
10. UP
11. UP
12. UP
13. UP → now at (9,8)

Thus, 13 moves in total.

But perhaps we can do better by combining some moves or adjusting directions earlier.

Wait, another idea: After moving right a few times, start moving up and then right again to cover more ground.

For example:

Move 1: RIGHT → (4,1)
Move 2: UP → (4,2)
Move 3: RIGHT → (5,2)
Move 4: UP → (5,3)
... etc., alternating directions.

But I need to ensure that each move doesn't cause collision with the body.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to plan moves where the snake makes a U-turn or similar to cover both x and y directions more efficiently.

But given the time constraints, perhaps it's best to stick with the initial plan of moving right then up, which ensures no collisions as long as we don't cross over our own path too much.

So, I think the answer is that the snake can reach (9,8) in 13 moves by first moving right six times and then up seven times.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to guide the snake from its starting position at (3,1) to the target position at (9,8) on a grid. The snake can move either horizontally or vertically one step at a time, and it cannot move into positions occupied by its own body.

### Approach
The approach involves two main phases:
1. **Move Right**: First, we move the snake all the way to the right along the x-axis from (3,1) to (9,1). This requires moving 6 steps to the right.
2. **Move Up**: Once the snake is aligned vertically below the target at (9,1), we then move it upwards 7 steps along the y-axis until it reaches (9,8).

This strategy ensures that the snake does not collide with its own body by keeping the movements sequential and avoiding overlapping paths.

### Solution Code
```python
# Initial position of the snake's head
head = [3, 1]
body = [[3,2], [3,3], [3,4]]  # The rest of the body

def move_snake(new_direction):
    global head, body
    new_head = head.copy()
    if new_direction == 'RIGHT':
        new_head[0] += 1
    elif new_direction == 'UP':
        new_head[1] += 1
    
    # Check for collision with body except the tail
    for part in body[:-1]:
        if new_head == part:
            return False
    
    # Move the snake
    head = new_head
    body.insert(0, head)
    body.pop()  # Remove the last part of the body
    
    return True

# First, move right 6 times
for _ in range(6):
    if not move_snake('RIGHT'):
        break

# Then, move up 7 times
for _ in range(7):
    if not move_snake('UP'):
        break

print(f"Final head position: {head}")
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The snake starts at (3,1) with its body extending from (3,2) to (3,4).
2. **Moving Right**: In each iteration of the loop, the snake moves right by updating the head's x-coordinate. After 6 such moves, the head reaches (9,1). Each move checks for collisions with the body except the last segment.
3. **Moving Up**: Once aligned at (9,1), the snake starts moving up by incrementing the y-coordinate in each iteration of another loop. This continues until the head is at (9,8).
4. **Collision Check**: Before each move, we ensure that the new head position does not collide with any part of the body except potentially the tail, which is handled by removing it after moving.

This method ensures a collision-free path to the target in 13 moves, providing an efficient and straightforward solution.
