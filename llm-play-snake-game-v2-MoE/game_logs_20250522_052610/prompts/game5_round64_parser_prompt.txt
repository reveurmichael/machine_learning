Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake get to the apple without dying. Let's start by understanding the current situation.

The snake's head is at (8,1), and the apple is at (9,1). The grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So, the head is just one step away from the apple in terms of x-coordinate; they're on the same y-level.

The snake's current direction is DOWN. That means it was moving down before this move. But wait, movement can't reverse direction immediately. So if the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP because that would reverse. However, since the current direction is given as DOWN, but the first move can be any except the opposite of the previous direction? Wait, no—rule 3 says the snake cannot reverse direction. So if it's currently going DOWN, the next move can't be UP because that's the opposite. But in this case, the snake is at (8,1), and the apple is to the right. So ideally, moving RIGHT would take it to (9,1) and eat the apple.

But wait, let me check the body cells. The body includes [(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So from this list, I can see that the snake's body is a vertical line from (5,5) up to (8,5), then it turns down at (8,5) to go to (8,4), (8,3), and (8,2). That means the tail is at (8,2), and each segment follows.

So the head is at (8,1). The direction was DOWN when the snake was moving towards (8,0), but perhaps it's now stopped or changed direction. Wait, no—the current direction is DOWN, so the next move must be in a direction that doesn't reverse. Since the previous direction was DOWN, the next move can't be UP.

But wait, the movement rule says that if the direction is NONE (which it isn't here), any move is allowed. So since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP because that's reversing. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

Wait, but moving DOWN from (8,1) would take the head to (8,0). Let me check if that's safe. The body includes (8,2), so when moving DOWN, the new head would be at (8,0). But wait, after moving, the body shifts. So the new head is added, and the tail either moves or stays if an apple was eaten.

Wait, but in this case, we're trying to move towards the apple, which is at (9,1). So moving RIGHT from (8,1) would take us directly to the apple. Let's check if that's possible.

But wait, can we move RIGHT? The current direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP because that reverses. But RIGHT isn't a reverse direction; it's a 90-degree turn from DOWN. So moving RIGHT is allowed because it doesn't reverse the direction.

So moving RIGHT would take the head to (9,1), eat the apple, and then the body grows by one segment. After eating the apple, the next move needs to ensure that there's at least one legal move afterward to avoid trapping the snake.

But before considering after-eating moves, let's first check if moving RIGHT is safe in terms of collision with the body.

The body cells are [(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So from the head at (8,1), moving RIGHT to (9,1)—is this position occupied by any body part? The body is up to (8,5) and then down. So (9,1) isn't in the body cells, so it's safe.

So moving RIGHT would be a valid move that allows the snake to eat the apple. But wait, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment. So the next position after moving RIGHT would have the tail not shrink because the apple was eaten. Therefore, the body will add (9,1) as the new head, and the previous body segments move forward.

Wait, no—the movement process is: when you move, the head moves, then each body part follows the one in front of it. So if the snake's current position is [head] at (8,1), followed by the body parts [(8,5)...], but wait that can't be right because the body is listed as [(5,5), ...]. Wait no, the body list seems to include all segments except the head.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The head is at (8,1). The body cells are given as a list of positions excluding the head. So the body starts from the segment right after the head and goes down. But looking at the coordinates, it's [(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. That suggests that the snake is a long line starting from somewhere behind.

Wait, perhaps I should visualize this. The head is at (8,1). Then the body goes back through (8,2), (8,3), etc., which implies that the snake was moving DOWN and then turned LEFT or something. But regardless, when considering whether moving RIGHT to (9,1) is safe.

So when the head moves RIGHT to (9,1), it's not occupied by any body part because the body cells are all at x=5-8 on y=5 down to y=2. So yes, that position is free.

Therefore, moving RIGHT would be a valid move and allow the snake to eat the apple.

But wait, according to movement rules, after eating the apple, the tail doesn't shrink. So when the snake eats the apple, it grows by one segment, meaning the body adds the new head without removing the tail. Therefore, after this move, the snake's body will be longer.

However, for the current move, we just need to make sure that moving RIGHT is safe and allowed.

Another consideration: The direction change from DOWN to RIGHT doesn't reverse, so it's allowed because DOWN and RIGHT are perpendicular; they don't reverse each other. Reversing would be going UP when currently going DOWN, or LEFT when going RIGHT, etc.

So the first move can be RIGHT, which is valid.

But wait, according to rule 3: if direction is NONE, any move is allowed. But in this case, the current direction is DOWN, so the next move cannot be UP because that's reversing. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. Moving RIGHT is allowed.

So the sequence would just be ["RIGHT"], and then after eating the apple, the snake grows, but as per constraints, we need to ensure there's at least one legal move afterward. But since after eating, the head is at (9,1), and the body has grown, perhaps it's safe.

Wait, no—after moving RIGHT to eat the apple, the next position would have the head at (9,1). The new body segments would be added without removing the tail because an apple was eaten. So now, the snake is longer by one segment. Then, we need to ensure that from this new position, there's at least one valid move.

But in our case, since the problem only requires planning up to eating the apple, perhaps that's sufficient.

Wait, no—the problem says "plan a safe path for the head to reach the apple, avoiding collisions." So perhaps the initial move is sufficient because it directly reaches the apple without any further moves needed. But I need to check if after moving RIGHT, the snake doesn't die.

But since the move leads directly to the apple and no collision occurs, it's a valid path.

Therefore, the optimal move is just ["RIGHT"], but wait—let me double-check because sometimes the direction change might cause issues. Since the current direction is DOWN, can we move RIGHT? Yes, because that's allowed—it's not reversing.

Another consideration: The Manhattan distance from (8,1) to (9,1) is 1 in x-direction and 0 in y. So moving RIGHT is the most efficient path.

So I think the correct moves are ["RIGHT"], which allows the snake to eat the apple without any issues.
</think>

The optimal move is to go right directly towards the apple since it's just one step away and doesn't involve reversing direction or colliding with the body.

## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (8, 1) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)], to eat the apple at (9, 1).

RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
