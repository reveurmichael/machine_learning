<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (1,1) to the apple at (0,0). The snake's body is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], and it's currently moving down. Hmm, wait, no—the current direction is "DOWN", but the head is at (1,1), so if it moves down again, it would go to (1,0). But I need to plan a safe path.

First, let me visualize the grid. The snake is in column x=1, starting from y=2 up to y=5. So the body extends upward from the head at (1,1). The apple is at (0,0), which is to the left and down from the head's current position.

The movement rules say that I can't reverse direction immediately. Since it's currently moving "DOWN", my next move can't be "UP". So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. But if I go DOWN again, the head would be at (1,0), which is right above the apple. Let me see: from there, maybe I could turn left to reach (0,0). But wait, after moving down, my direction would change to "DOWN" again? No, each move updates the direction.

Wait, no—the current direction is DOWN, so if I choose another direction, like LEFT, that's allowed because it's not reversing. So let me think step by step.

Current position: Head at (1,1), body behind is (1,2) up to (1,5). Direction is DOWN, which means the snake was moving down before this move. But wait, if the head is at (1,1) and direction is DOWN, that would have come from a previous move where it moved down, but since the body starts at (1,2), perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no—the body list is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], which are behind the head. So the snake's tail is at (1,5). The direction is DOWN, meaning that from the head, it was moving down to get there. Wait, but the head is at (1,1), so if it moved down again, it would go out of bounds because y=0 is the bottom.

Wait no—the grid's coordinates have (0,0) as bottom-left, and (9,9) as top-right. So moving DOWN from (1,1) would decrease y by 1 to (1,0), which is valid because y can be 0. But if I move down again from (1,1), the head becomes (1,0). Then, in the next step, I have to make sure that this new position doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail.

Wait, but after moving down to (1,0), the body would update. The old head (1,1) is added to the front of the body list, so the new body list becomes [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]. Then, since we're not eating an apple here, we remove the tail (which was at (1,5)), but wait—no, because the apple is at (0,0). So in this case, moving down to (1,0) doesn't eat the apple. Therefore, after moving, the body becomes [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)].

So now the head is at (1,0), and the body is as above. The next move can't be UP because that would reverse from DOWN? Wait no—the current direction after moving down would become DOWN again? Or does each move change the direction to the chosen one?

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how directions work. Each move is in a new direction, unless it's continuing the same as before. But according to the rules, you can't reverse immediately. So if current direction is DOWN, next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN? Or wait—no: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next, and vice versa for LEFT and RIGHT.

So from a current direction of DOWN, the possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. Wait no—that's not correct. Reversing would be moving in the opposite direction. So if current direction is DOWN, the reverse would be UP. So the next move can't be UP; it can be any other direction except UP.

Wait, no—the rules say you cannot choose the reverse direction on the first move. Wait, actually, rule 2 says: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current direction is DOWN, you can't choose UP next.

So in this case, current direction is DOWN. So next move cannot be UP. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue with DOWN? Or wait—no, the movement is determined by the chosen direction each time. So each move must be a new direction choice, but you can't reverse from the previous.

Wait, no: Each move you choose a direction; you can choose any except reversing from the current direction. So if I'm moving DOWN now, next move can't be UP. But I can continue moving DOWN again? Or does each move require changing direction?

No—the movement is based on your chosen direction each step. So if you're in DOWN and choose to move LEFT instead of continuing down, that's allowed as long as it's not the reverse.

Wait, no—each move must be a single direction choice; you can't stay in the same direction unless you choose it again. But the rules don't prevent choosing the same direction again, except for reversing.

So from DOWN, I can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue with DOWN as long as it's not UP (which is reverse). Wait no—if current direction is DOWN, moving DOWN again would mean choosing the same direction, which is allowed because it's not reversing. So you can move in the same direction multiple times.

So back to planning: The head is at (1,1), body behind is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], apple at (0,0).

I need to plan a path that gets the head from (1,1) to (0,0) without colliding with the body.

Possible first moves:

If I choose LEFT: new_head is (0,1). Check if this is safe. The body is [(1,2), ...], so at (1,2), etc., but (0,1) is not in the body except possibly after moving.

Wait no—the body cells are given before the move; during collision check, only the current state is considered. So when choosing to move LEFT to (0,1):

- Is (0,1) outside grid? No.
- Does (0,1) coincide with any BODYi except possibly the tail?

The current body list is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]. So (0,1) is not in this list. Therefore, moving LEFT to (0,1) is safe.

After moving LEFT:

- new_head is (0,1).
- Since it's not the apple position (which is (0,0)), we update body by adding old head (1,1) to front and remove tail (1,5). So body becomes [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)].

So now, the snake's state after first move is:

Head: (0,1)
Body: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]

Next move options: current direction is LEFT. So next move cannot be RIGHT (since it's reverse). So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

But wait, the current direction after moving LEFT is now LEFT. So next move can't be RIGHT. So from (0,1), I can choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

If I choose UP: new_head would be (0,2). Let's check:

- Is (0,2) in body? Body is [(1,1), (1,2), ...]. No. So safe.
- Move to (0,2), which isn't apple yet. Then body becomes [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)].

Then next move from UP: direction can't be DOWN.

But I need to reach (0,0). Maybe after two more moves:

From (0,2) with direction UP, moving DOWN would take me back towards (0,1), but that's the previous head. Alternatively, maybe better to change direction.

Alternatively, let's think of another approach.

Alternative first move: Instead of LEFT, what if I choose DOWN? From (1,1), DOWN takes me to (1,0). Let's see:

- Is (1,0) safe? The body is [(1,2), ...], so no collision except tail. After moving, new_head is (1,0).

Since it's not the apple, update body by adding old head (1,1) and removing tail (1,5). So body becomes [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)].

Now head is at (1,0), direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP.

From here, to reach (0,0), which is LEFT and DOWN? But wait, from (1,0), moving LEFT would take me to (0,0), which is the apple position.

So let's see:

First move: DOWN to (1,0).

Second move: check if I can go LEFT to (0,0). Let's verify.

- From head at (1,0), current direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP.
- Moving LEFT from (1,0) is allowed as it's not reverse.
- new_head is (0,0), which is the apple position. So eat apple: body becomes [(1,0)] + ... but wait, no—when you eat an apple, your body doesn't change except for adding the new head and keeping all previous segments.

Wait, no—the rules don't mention apples in this problem; perhaps it's just a point to reach. But in any case, moving to (0,0) would be reaching the target.

But let's check collision after moving:

When I move from (1,0) to (0,0), new_head is (0,0).

Check if (0,0) is in body: Current body after first move is [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]. So no, (0,0) isn't in there.

Thus, this path would be safe:

Move 1: DOWN to (1,0).

Move 2: LEFT to (0,0). Done.

But wait—let's make sure about the body updates after each move.

First move:

- Head moves from (1,1) to (1,0) via DOWN.
- Body becomes [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)] because we add old head and remove tail.
- Check: After moving, the body is [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)].

Second move:

- Head moves from (1,0) to (0,0) via LEFT.
- Since it's apple position, but regardless, we add old head (1,0) to front of body: [(1,0)] + [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)].

Wait no—the body list is the segments behind the head. So after moving from (1,1) to (1,0):

- Body becomes [ (old_head (1,1)), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)] because we add old head and remove tail.

After that, when moving from (1,0) to (0,0):

- Add old head (1,0) to front of body: [(1,0)], then the previous body is [ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)] but wait—the tail was removed in first move. So after first move, the body is four segments: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).

When moving to (0,0):

- New head is (0,0).
- Add old head (1,0) to front of body list.
- Remove tail (1,4). So new body list becomes [ (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)].

So no collision occurs because the new head (0,0) isn't in the body except possibly the old head which was just added. But in this case, after first move, body doesn't include (0,0). So moving to (0,0) is safe.

Therefore, a possible path is:

1. DOWN to (1,0).
2. LEFT to (0,0).

This seems efficient and safe. Let me check for any issues.

Wait—another thought: After the first move to (1,0), the direction becomes DOWN. But moving from (1,0) to (0,0) is a LEFT move, which changes direction to LEFT. So that's allowed because it's not reversing.

Thus, the two moves would be:

- Move 1: DOWN.
- Move 2: LEFT.

This gets us from (1,1) → (1,0) → (0,0), without collision.

But wait—is moving directly down then left possible? Because sometimes in grid movements, you have to plan around the body. Let me think again.

Alternatively, what if I first move LEFT to (0,1), then DOWN twice to reach (0,0). But that would take three moves, which is longer than two moves. So the first approach seems better.

Another alternative: Maybe moving RIGHT or UP from the initial position could be useful, but from (1,1):

- Moving RIGHT goes to (2,1), but the apple is at (0,0), so that's a detour.
- Moving UP would go to (1,2), which is part of the body after the move, but wait—no. Let me see: If I choose UP as first move from (1,1) with current direction DOWN? Wait no—the current direction is DOWN; can't reverse to UP.

Wait, hold on—if current direction is DOWN, next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. It cannot be UP because that would be reversing.

So moving UP isn't allowed as the first step from DOWN. So possible first moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

We've considered LEFT and DOWN; maybe RIGHT is another option but seems counterproductive.

So I think the most efficient path is two moves: DOWN then LEFT.

Thus, the sequence of moves would be:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT

This should get us from (1,1) to (0,0) without colliding with the body.

Let me double-check collision after each move:

After first move (DOWN):

- Head at (1,0)
- Body: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]
- No collision because (1,0) is not in the body except for possibly overlapping with the tail? But after moving down, we added (1,1) to the front and removed (1,5). So no overlap.

After second move (LEFT):

- Head at (0,0)
- Body: [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]
- No collision because (0,0) isn't in this body list except for the just-added (1,0). But (0,0) is new head; previous body doesn't include it.

Thus, this path is safe.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple located at a specific coordinate on a grid. The snake can move in four directions but cannot reverse direction immediately after the previous move. Additionally, the snake must avoid colliding with its own body.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Grid and Movement Constraints**: The snake starts at (1, 1) with its body extending upwards to (1, 5). The apple is located at (0, 0). The snake can move in four directions but cannot reverse direction immediately.
2. **Initial Move Analysis**: From the starting position (1, 1), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since moving UP would be reversing from a previous DOWN move).
3. **Optimal Path Identification**:
   - Moving DOWN to (1, 0) is safe and brings the snake closer to the apple.
   - From (1, 0), moving LEFT to (0, 0) reaches the apple without colliding with the body.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the steps taken by the snake to reach the target position.

# Initial state
head = (1, 1)
body = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]
direction = "DOWN"
target = (0, 0)

# Move 1: DOWN to (1, 0)
new_head = (head[0], head[1] - 1)  # since direction is DOWN
if new_head != target:
    body = [head] + body[:-1]
else:
    body = [head] + body
head = new_head

# Move 2: LEFT to (0, 0)
new_head = (new_head[0] - 1, new_head[1])  # direction changes to LEFT
if new_head == target:
    body = [new_head] + body
else:
    body = [head] + body[:-1]
head = new_head

print("Snake reached the target successfully!")
```

### Explanation
1. **First Move (DOWN)**: The snake moves from (1, 1) to (1, 0). This move is safe as it doesn't collide with its body and brings it closer to the apple.
2. **Second Move (LEFT)**: From (1, 0), the snake moves LEFT to reach (0, 0), which is the target position. This move is also safe and completes the path without any collision.

This approach ensures that the snake reaches the target efficiently in two moves while adhering to movement constraints and avoiding self-collision.
