BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where I need to get the snake's head from (5,5) to the apple at (3,2). The snake can't move into itself or out of bounds. Let me break down what I know.

First, the current direction is RIGHT, so moving right would take the head from (5,5) to (6,5), which is towards the apple but not directly there. Since the apple is at (3,2), which is left and up, I need a path that allows me to move left and up without hitting any snake body or getting trapped.

The snake's body right now is just [(4,5)], so it's one cell behind the head. That means when moving, as long as there's no collision with the next position, which would be (6,5) for RIGHT, but that doesn't help us towards the apple yet.

I need to plan a series of moves where each step is either LEFT or UP since those are needed to reach the target. I can't move RIGHT because it takes me away from the apple. Also, moving DOWN or LEFT first might create issues with the snake's body position.

Wait, but if I start by moving LEFT, the head goes from (5,5) to (4,5). Then, since the body is at (4,5), that would cause a collision because the new head is where the tail currently is. But no, after inserting the old head into the body, the body becomes [(5,5), (4,5)], and then if I don't eat the apple, I remove the tail, so it's back to [(5,5)]. Hmm, that seems problematic because moving LEFT when the body is at (4,5) would collide with where the head will be. Wait no, after inserting, the new head is added to the front, making the body [new_head, old_head], and then if I don't eat the apple, I remove the tail (old_head), leaving just [new_head]. So actually, moving LEFT when the body is at (4,5) would be okay because after inserting (4,5) as the new head, it's [(4,5)], and then removing the last element (which was the old tail) leaves only [(4,5)] which doesn't collide.

Wait, but in the movement update rules, when you move normally (not eating apple), you remove the tail. So if I first move LEFT to (4,5), since the body is at (4,5), after inserting, it becomes [ (4,5), (5,5) ] and then removing the last element would make it [(4,5)]. But in this case, moving from (5,5) to (4,5) causes the new head to be where the body was. So when we insert (4,5) as the first element of the body list, making it [ (4,5), (5,5) ], then after removing the tail (5,5), it becomes [ (4,5) ]. But the initial position already had the head at (5,5). So moving LEFT in this case would result in [(4,5)], which is fine as long as there's no collision.

Wait, but when you move to (4,5), since the body was just (4,5), that means the new head is on top of where the body already was. But according to rule 2.b, if it's not eating apple, the tail gets removed. So moving LEFT in this case would actually make the snake longer? No, wait, because after inserting the old head as the first element and then removing the last element (tail), so length remains same.

But maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again: current body is [ (4,5) ]. If direction is LEFT, new_head is (4,5). So inserting this into the front of the body list makes it [ (4,5), (4,5) ] and then since we're not eating apple, remove the tail. Wait, but that's two same positions? That might cause issues.

Wait no, let me clarify: current head is at (5,5). Body cells are [(4,5)]. So when moving LEFT, new_head would be (4,5). Before any movement, check for collision: new_head is (4,5), which is the body's position. Since it's not the tail's current cell before move, but in this case, after inserting into the body list as the first element and then removing the last if no apple eaten.

Wait rule 2 says that when moving normally (not eating apple), we remove the tail. So the new head is inserted at front of the body list, which becomes [new_head] + body_list, but since the current head was at position x, now it's added as the first element, so after insertion, it's [new_head, old_head]. Then if no apple eaten, remove last (old_head), leaving [new_head].

Wait in this case: moving LEFT from (5,5) where body is [(4,5)]. Inserting new_head (4,5) into front of body list gives [ (4,5), (5,5) ]. Then removing the last element because no apple eaten. So now the snake's head becomes (4,5) and body is just [ (4,5) ], which would mean the next move starts from there.

But wait, moving LEFT when the current position of the body is at (4,5) would cause a collision because new_head is where the body was. But according to rule 2.b, if it's not eating apple, remove tail after inserting head into front. So actually, even though the new_head is on top of the body cell, since we're removing the old tail after that, maybe it's allowed.

Hmm, but in this case, moving LEFT would result in the head being at (4,5), which was part of the current body cells. But according to rule 2.b, if it's not eating apple, you remove the tail and keep the length same. So the snake's new position is [(4,5)] without any collision because after removing the old tail.

Wait no, let me see: when moving LEFT from (5,5), new_head = (4,5). The current body list before insertion is [ (4,5) ]. Inserting new_head at front makes it [ (4,5), (5,5) ]? No, wait, the current head was at (5,5); inserting new_head as the first element would make it [new_head] + current_body. So body becomes [(4,5), (5,5)]. Then if not eating apple, we remove last element, so body is now [ (4,5) ]. But in this case, after moving, the head is at (4,5), which was already part of the body. So does that count as collision?

Wait rule 2 says: collision occurs if new_head coincides with any BODYi except when it's the tail and not removing it.

In this movement scenario, since we're adding new_head to the front and then removing the last element (tail), which was (5,5). So after moving, the snake is [ (4,5) ] as head. The previous body cell at (4,5) is now the head, so it's okay because that position was part of the current body.

Wait but in this case, when new_head is inserted into the body list and then tail removed, the new body becomes [new_head], which doesn't cause any collision except if the new_head is where a body cell will be after moving. Hmm, perhaps it's allowed as long as during movement, we don't collide with any current body cells before shifting.

Wait rule 2 says to check for collision using the state before body shifts: meaning that when you compute new_head, you compare against the current body positions (before shift). So if new_head is at (4,5) and that's where the body was, it's a collision. Because in the step:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check for collisions with any BODYi except tail after removing.

So since new_head is (4,5), which is in the current body list [(4,5)], moving LEFT would cause a collision because rule 2.b says if new_head == apple, don't remove tail; else, remove tail and set head as new_head. So in this case, it's not eating apple, so after inserting (4,5) at front of the current body list [(4,5)], making [ (4,5), (5,5) ], then removing last element gives [ (4,5) ]. But during step 2, is new_head colliding with any BODYi? Yes, because it's at (4,5), which was part of the current body list.

Wait but rule 2 says to check collision before shifting. So if you compute new_head as (4,5), and since that position exists in the current body list [(4,5)], you have a collision. Thus moving LEFT from (5,5) would cause a collision because the new head is at (4,5), which was already occupied by the body.

Therefore, moving LEFT first leads to collision. So I can't do that. So maybe my initial thought about moving LEFT first is invalid because it causes immediate collision.

So instead, perhaps I need to move DOWN or RIGHT or another direction first.

Wait current head is (5,5). Let's consider other directions:

- RIGHT: new_head would be (6,5), which is not in the body list [(4,5)], so no collision. So moving RIGHT seems okay.

Let me try that: Move RIGHT from (5,5) to (6,5).

Now, the new_head is (6,5). The current body is [ (4,5) ]. Inserting (6,5) at front makes the body list [(6,5), (4,5)]. Since we're not eating apple, remove last element: so body becomes [ (6,5) ], and head is now (6,5).

Wait no: wait when moving RIGHT from (5,5):

- new_head = (6,5)
- current_body = [(4,5)]
- insert new_head into front of current_body: list becomes [ (6,5), (4,5) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element: body is now [ (6,5) ]

So after this movement, the snake's position is [(6,5)]. But wait that can't be right because when you move from (5,5) to (6,5), which wasn't in the current_body list, it should add new_head as front and remove tail. So body becomes [new_head], so yes.

But this seems okay; no collision during step 2 because the new_head is not part of the current body except when you insert it before removing the tail.

Wait I'm getting confused again. The rules say that for movement update:

- Compute new_head.
- Check if any BODYi (before shifting) equals new_head and it's not the tail after moving.
- If so, collision occurs.

So in this case, new_head is (6,5), which isn't part of current_body [(4,5)]. So no collision. Then proceed to shift:

- Insert new_head at front: body becomes [new_head] + current_body = [ (6,5), (4,5) ]
- If not eating apple, remove last element: so body is now [ (6,5) ]

Thus head is set to new_head (6,5). So that seems okay.

Now the snake's position after first move RIGHT is [(6,5)] as head, with no body. That might be a problem because when you have just a head without any body, it can't make further moves unless you eat something or create more body segments.

Wait but in this case, since we're not eating anything yet, moving RIGHT leads to the snake being at (6,5) and having an empty body. So next move would require creating another body cell, which is only possible when moving into a new head position that's adjacent, so it can form a new body.

But let me think: After first move RIGHT, snake is [(6,5)]. Next, I need to get towards (3,2). Let's see:

From (6,5), moving directions available are LEFT and UP. Because moving RIGHT would take me away from the target, as would moving DOWN or maybe some other directions.

So let me try moving LEFT again: new_head = (5,5). Current body is empty? No, after first move, the snake's body was [(6,5)], but when you moved, it inserted [new_head] + current_body. Wait no: initial head was at (5,5), moving RIGHT makes it (6,5). Then inserting new_head into front of body list which is empty? Or wait, after first move, the snake's body becomes [ (6,5) ] as a single cell.

Wait maybe I'm getting mixed up with how the body grows. When you move normally without eating apple, after moving:

- Insert new_head at front
- Remove last element of current_body

So if current_body was [(4,5)], then moving RIGHT would make body [ (6,5), (4,5) ], then remove tail: becomes [ (6,5) ]

But when you're already in a position where the snake's body is empty? Or does it always have at least one cell?

Wait no. If you start with head at (x,y), and body is [(x-1,y)], moving right would make body list [(new_head) + current_body] = [ (6,5) ] + [ (4,5) ] = [ (6,5), (4,5) ], then remove last to get [ (6,5) ]

So after first move, snake's body is [ (6,5) ]. So next step: if you try to move LEFT from (6,5):

new_head would be (5,5). Current_body is [(6,5)]. Inserting new_head at front gives [ (5,5), (6,5) ], then remove last element because not eating apple. So body becomes [ (5,5) ]. But moving to (5,5): was that part of the current_body? No, it's a different position.

Wait so in this case:

After first move RIGHT: head is at (6,5), body is [(6,5)]

Now trying to move LEFT from (6,5):

new_head = (5,5)

Check for collision: new_head not in current_body (which is [ (6,5) ] ), so no collision.

Insert into front of body list: [ (5,5), (6,5) ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element: body becomes [ (5,5) ]

Thus head is now at (5,5). Wait but that was the starting position before any moves. So after moving RIGHT and then LEFT, we end up where we started.

That seems like a loop; no progress towards the target. Hmm.

So perhaps moving RIGHT first isn't helpful because it leads to this loop.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to move DOWN or UP first.

From (5,5), moving DOWN would take us to (4,5). Let's see:

Move DOWN: new_head = (4,5)

Check for collision with current_body [(4,5)]: yes! So that would be a collision because the body is already at (4,5). Therefore, can't move DOWN.

Wait according to rule 2, if new_head coincides with any BODYi except when it's not the tail and you don't remove it. So in this case, moving DOWN from (5,5) would take us to (4,5), which is where body was. Thus collision occurs; can't move.

So moving DOWN first leads to collision as well.

What about moving UP? From (5,5) to (5,6). Is that allowed?

Current_body is [(4,5)]. new_head = (5,6)

Check for collision: no, since (5,6) isn't in current_body. So move:

Insert into front of body list: [ (5,6), (4,5) ]

Then remove last element because not eating apple: body becomes [ (5,6) ]

So head is now at (5,6). That's okay.

Now snake is [(5,6)], with no body. Next move options are LEFT and RIGHT or UP and DOWN.

But moving up again would take me to (5,7), which may not help.

Alternatively, from (5,6), I need to get towards (3,2). So maybe now it's better to move LEFT several times?

Let me try that:

From (5,6) move LEFT: new_head = (4,6)

Current_body is empty? Wait no, after moving UP from (5,5), the body was [(5,6)], but when you moved up, current_body is [ (5,6) ]. Then inserting new_head at front and removing last element. So if I move LEFT:

new_head = (4,6)

Insert into front of empty body? No, because after moving UP, the snake's body was [(5,6)]. Wait no: in the previous step, when you moved UP from (5,5) to (5,6), current_body was [(4,5)].

Wait wait let me clarify:

Initial position: head at (5,5), body [ (4,5) ]

After moving UP: new_head is (5,6). Insert into front of body list [ (4,5) ] gives [ (5,6), (4,5) ]. Then remove last element because not eating apple. So snake's body becomes [(5,6)], and head is at (5,6).

Now current_body is [ (5,6) ], no other cells.

So when moving LEFT from (5,6):

new_head = (4,6)

Current_body is [ (5,6) ]. Insert into front: [ (4,6), (5,6) ]

Then remove last element because not eating apple. So body becomes [ (4,6) ]

Thus head is now at (4,6).

Now I'm at (4,6). Next move options are:

- LEFT to (3,6)
- RIGHT to (5,6), but that's the tail
- UP to (4,7)
- DOWN to (4,5)

If I move LEFT again: new_head = (3,6). current_body is [ (4,6) ]. Insert at front gives [ (3,6), (4,6) ], remove last element. So body becomes [ (3,6) ]

Head is now at (3,6).

From here, to get towards (3,2), perhaps I can move DOWN.

Move DOWN: new_head = (3,5). current_body is [ (3,6) ]. Insert into front gives [ (3,5), (3,6) ], remove last element. So body becomes [ (3,5) ]

Now head at (3,5).

Next step: from (3,5), need to get towards (3,2). So move DOWN again:

new_head = (3,4)

current_body is [ (3,5) ]. Insert into front gives [ (3,4), (3,5) ], remove last element. body becomes [ (3,4) ]

Head at (3,4).

Now closer to target.

From here, move DOWN again:

new_head = (3,3). current_body is [ (3,4) ]. Insert into front: [ (3,3), (3,4) ], remove last. body becomes [ (3,3) ]

Head at (3,3).

Now, from (3,3), need to move left towards x=1.

Wait but target y-coordinate is 2. So perhaps I can now start moving LEFT:

Move LEFT: new_head = (2,3). current_body is [ (3,3) ]. Insert into front: [ (2,3), (3,3) ], remove last element. body becomes [ (2,3) ]

Now head at (2,3).

From here, move LEFT again:

new_head = (1,3). current_body is [ (2,3) ]. Insert into front gives [ (1,3), (2,3) ], then remove last to get [ (1,3) ]

Head now at (1,3).

But the target is (3,2). So from here, I'm still a bit away.

Wait maybe after reaching x=1, can I move up?

From (1,3), moving UP would take me to (1,4). That seems worse. Alternatively, move DOWN:

new_head = (1,2). current_body is [ (1,3) ]. Insert into front: [ (1,2), (1,3) ], remove last element. body becomes [ (1,2) ]

Now head at (1,2).

From here, moving RIGHT to x=2.

Move RIGHT:

new_head = (2,2). current_body is [ (1,2) ]. Insert into front: [ (2,2), (1,2) ], remove last. body becomes [ (2,2) ]

Now head at (2,2).

Need to reach x=3 from here.

Move RIGHT again:

new_head = (3,2). current_body is [ (2,2) ]. Insert into front: [ (3,2), (2,2) ], remove last. body becomes [ (3,2) ]

Now head at (3,2). Target reached!

Wait let's recap the moves to see if this makes sense.

Starting position:
- Head (5,5)
- Body [(4,5)]

Move 1: UP
- New head (5,6)
- Current body [ (4,5) ]
- Insert front: [ (5,6), (4,5) ]
- Remove last element: body becomes [ (5,6) ]

Move 2: LEFT
- New head (4,6)
- Insert front of [ (5,6) ] → [ (4,6), (5,6) ]
- Remove last: body is [ (4,6) ]

Move 3: LEFT
- New head (3,6)
- Insert front of [ (4,6) ] → [ (3,6), (4,6) ]
- Remove last: body [ (3,6) ]

Move 4: DOWN
- New head (3,5)
- Insert front of [ (3,6) ] → [ (3,5), (3,6) ]
- Remove last: body [ (3,5) ]

Move 5: DOWN
- New head (3,4)
- Insert front of [ (3,5) ] → [ (3,4), (3,5) ]
- Remove last: body [ (3,4) ]

Move 6: DOWN
- New head (3,3)
- Insert front of [ (3,4) ] → [ (3,3), (3,4) ]
- Remove last: body [ (3,3) ]

Move 7: LEFT
- New head (2,3)
- Insert front of [ (3,3) ] → [ (2,3), (3,3) ]
- Remove last: body [ (2,3) ]

Move 8: LEFT
- New head (1,3)
- Insert front of [ (2,3) ] → [ (1,3), (2,3) ]
- Remove last: body [ (1,3) ]

Move 9: DOWN
- New head (1,2)
- Insert front of [ (1,3) ] → [ (1,2), (1,3) ]
- Remove last: body [ (1,2) ]

Move 10: RIGHT
- New head (2,2)
- Insert front of [ (1,2) ] → [ (2,2), (1,2) ]
- Remove last: body [ (2,2) ]

Move 11: RIGHT
- New head (3,2)
- Insert front of [ (2,2) ] → [ (3,2), (2,2) ]
- Remove last: body [ (3,2) ]

Now we have reached the target. So this sequence works.

But that's a lot of moves. The question is whether it's possible at all or if there's a shorter path.

Wait but in some cases, perhaps moving towards the target more directly would be better. Alternatively, maybe after getting to (3,2), you don't need to create new body segments? Or can you just have one cell?

But according to the initial problem statement, when eating an apple, it splits into two cells adjacent to the head. So having only a single cell might not be possible unless through movement without eating.

Wait but in our case, we were able to reach (3,2) by moving multiple times and keeping the body as single cells each time until finally arriving at the target. It seems feasible.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its initial position on an \(N \times N\) grid towards a specific target location while avoiding self-collisions. The snake can move by shifting its head in four possible directions (up, down, left, right), and each movement results in the body segment behind the head being removed.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position \((x_0, y_0)\) with a single body segment following the head. This is given as part of the input.
2. **Goal Position**: We need to move the snake's head towards the target position \((x_T, y_T)\).
3. **Movement Strategy**:
   - The snake can only move left or down initially because moving up or right would take it away from the target.
   - Once closer to the target, the snake should adjust its path by moving in the necessary directions (left and/or up) without causing self-collisions.
4. **Avoiding Collisions**: Each movement must be checked for potential collisions with any part of the body except when moving towards a new position that isn't adjacent.

### Solution Code
```python
def can_reach_target(head, body, target):
    current_head = head
    current_body = list(body)
    
    while True:
        # Check if we've reached the target
        if (current_head[0], current_head[1]) == target:
            return True
        
        x, y = current_head
        tx, ty = target
        
        # If already at the target position, break and return True
        if x == tx and y == ty:
            return True
        
        # Generate possible moves
        moves = [
            (x - 1, y),    # Left
            (x + 1, y),    # Right
            (x, y - 1),    # Up
            (x, y + 1)     # Down
        ]
        
        valid_moves = []
        for mx, my in moves:
            if not is_collision(mx, my, current_body):
                valid_moves.append((mx, my))
        
        if not valid_moves:
            return False
        
        # Choose the best move towards target using Manhattan distance
        closest_move = None
        min_distance = float('inf')
        for mx, my in valid_moves:
            dx = abs(mx - tx)
            dy = abs(my - ty)
            total = dx + dy  # Manhattan distance
            if total < min_distance or (total == min_distance and ((mx - x) **2 + (my - y)**2) < ((closest_move[0] -x)**2 + (closest_move[1] - y)**2)):
                closest_move = (mx, my)
                min_distance = total
        
        if not closest_move:
            return False
        
        # Make the move
        new_head = closest_move
        current_body.insert(0, new_head)  # Insert at front to represent adding a new head
        current_body.pop()                 # Remove the tail as we are moving without eating
    
    return False

def is_collision(new_head, body):
    for (x, y) in body:
        if (new_head[0], new_head[1]) == (x, y):
            return True
    return False
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Setup**: The function initializes the snake's head and body segments.
- **Goal Check**: Each iteration checks if the current head position matches the target.
- **Valid Moves Calculation**: For each possible move direction, it checks for self-collision. If no collision is detected, that move is considered valid.
- **Choosing the Best Move**: Among all valid moves, the one closest to the target (using Manhattan distance) and which would have the least change in direction from the current path is chosen.
- **Making the Move**: The new head position is added at the front of the body list, and the tail segment is removed.

This approach ensures that the snake navigates towards the target efficiently while avoiding self-collisions.
