<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (6,5) to the apple at (1,4). The current direction is RIGHT, and there are no body segments, which means the snake is just the head and nothing else. 

First, I need to understand where the snake is and where it needs to go. The head is at (6,5), and the apple is at (1,4). Looking at the coordinates, the apple is to the left and slightly down from the head. Since the grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right, moving left decreases the x-coordinate, and moving down decreases the y-coordinate.

The snake's current direction is RIGHT, which means it can't immediately reverse to LEFT because that would be a 180-degree turn. Wait, no—the rules say you can't choose the opposite direction of your current one. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. But wait, the first move after NONE can be any direction except reversing. In this case, the initial direction is RIGHT, so the first move cannot be LEFT? Or does it mean that if you're going RIGHT, you can't go DOWN or something else? Wait no—the movement rules say you can't reverse. So if current direction is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT, and vice versa. So from RIGHT, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

Wait, but the initial state's direction is RIGHT, so for the first move, I have to choose a direction that isn't the opposite of RIGHT, which would be LEFT. So the options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

But wait, no—the movement rules say you can't reverse. If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So if current is RIGHT, can't choose LEFT next. So initial possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

Wait, but the initial direction is RIGHT, so the first move cannot be LEFT. But I'm starting at (6,5), and I need to get left to reach (1,4). So maybe I should plan a way to turn without immediately reversing.

But since there are no body segments, the snake can maneuver more freely. Let me think about the path.

The apple is at (1,4). The head is at (6,5). To get from (6,5) to (1,4), I need to move left 5 times and down once. But I have to do this without colliding with my own body or going out of bounds.

Since the snake has no body right now, the main concern is not moving into walls and ensuring that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move next turn.

So let's plan a path:

1. The head is at (6,5). Current direction is RIGHT, so it's facing towards increasing x. But I need to go left, which is opposite. So first, maybe change direction without reversing immediately.

Wait, but can't reverse on the first move? Wait no—the movement rules say you cannot reverse if current direction isn't NONE. Since current is RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT. So first move options are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

But I need to go left eventually. Maybe I can make a U-turn after some steps.

Wait, but the initial body is empty, so if I change direction, it's possible as long as I don't immediately reverse.

Alternatively, maybe just start moving down first to get closer in y-coordinate and then move left.

Let me think step by step:

Current position: (6,5), direction RIGHT. Body is empty.

First move options: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

If I go DOWN (y-1) from (6,5), new head would be (6,4). Then next moves can start going left.

But wait, the apple is at (1,4), so y=4, same as where I'd end up if I move down once. So maybe that's a good idea.

Wait no—the apple is at (1,4), which has y=4, but current head after moving down would be (6,4). Then I can start moving left towards x=1.

But wait, the initial direction is RIGHT, so if I first move DOWN, then change direction to LEFT, that's allowed because DOWN and LEFT are not reverses of each other.

Wait, movement rules say you cannot choose the opposite direction. So current direction is RIGHT; next can't be LEFT. But after moving DOWN, the new direction would be DOWN, so next moves can't be UP.

So perhaps:

Move 1: DOWN (from (6,5) to (6,4)).

Then move 2: LEFT (since previous was DOWN, now I'm going LEFT—allowed because LEFT is not opposite of DOWN).

Wait no—the movement rules say you cannot reverse. So if your current direction is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT; but if you change direction to DOWN first, then from DOWN, you can go LEFT as it's not the opposite (opposite of DOWN would be UP). Wait, no—each direction has only one opposite: UP and DOWN are opposites; LEFT and RIGHT are opposites. So after moving DOWN, the next move cannot be UP.

So if I first move DOWN to (6,4), then I can choose LEFT as it's not the opposite of DOWN.

But wait, in this case, the current direction was RIGHT, so the first move can't be LEFT. Wait no—the initial direction is RIGHT, but after moving DOWN, the new direction would be DOWN, and from there, any non-opposite directions are allowed.

Wait, no—the movement rules say that you cannot reverse on your next move if the current direction isn't NONE. So when you're going in a certain direction, you can't choose its opposite as the next move.

So initial direction is RIGHT (from input). First move options: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

If I choose DOWN first:

Move 1: DOWN → (6,4), direction now is DOWN.

Then, move 2: can't go UP, but can go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But I need to get left, so perhaps after moving down once, then start going LEFT.

Wait, but the initial body is empty. So after moving down and then left, the body would be [ (6,5) ] as the first move's old head, then new head at (6,4), then next moves can proceed.

Wait no—the movement update rules say that when you move, the old head is added to the front of the body list. So after moving DOWN:

- New head: (6,4).

- Body becomes [ (6,5) ] (since the old head was at (6,5)).

Then, if I choose LEFT next:

New head would be (5,4). Check for collision: current body is [(6,5)], which is not in the new head's position. So safe.

After that move:

- Body becomes [ (6,4), (6,5) ]? Wait no—wait, when you move, the old head is added to the front of the body list.

Wait, initial state: head at (6,5), body empty.

First move: DOWN → new head (6,4). Then, since it's a normal move (not eating apple), the body becomes [ (6,5) ] (old head) and then we remove the tail if not growing. But since there was no body before, after moving down, the body is just [(6,5)], but wait, no—the body list in the input is empty. So when you move, step 3a says to insert old head at front of body list.

Wait, initial body cells are empty. After first move (DOWN), new head is (6,4). Then:

- Insert old head (6,5) into body → body becomes [ (6,5) ].

Since we didn't eat the apple (apple is at (1,4)), step 3c: remove tail (but since there was no tail before, perhaps nothing to remove. Wait, initial body list is empty, so after first move:

- Body list after inserting old head is [ (6,5) ].

Since not eating apple, step 3c says remove last element of body (tail), but if the body is just [(6,5)], then removing it would leave an empty body. Wait no—the initial body was empty; after moving down, the new head is (6,4), and the old head (6,5) is added to the front of the body list, which was empty. So body becomes [ (6,5) ].

Then, since not eating apple, step 3c says remove last element of body (the tail). But in this case, the body has only one element [(6,5)], so removing it would leave an empty body. That can't be right because the snake must consist of head and body segments, but if the body is empty after that, it's just the head.

Wait no—the body list represents all body segments except the head. So in this case, the initial body list was empty, meaning the snake is only the head (length 1). After moving down, the new head is (6,4), and the old head (6,5) becomes part of the body.

But since it's a normal move (not eating apple), step 3c says to remove the tail. But in this case, the body list after inserting old head is [ (6,5) ], which is the only element. So removing the last element would leave an empty body again. That seems odd, but I guess that's how it works.

So after first move:

- Head: (6,4)

- Body: empty? Or does the body have one segment?

Wait, no—the movement update rules say:

After computing new head and checking for collision, if safe:

a. Insert old head into front of BODY list → so body becomes [old_head].

b. If not growing (i.e., not eating apple), remove last element from body.

But if the body was empty before, inserting old head makes it [old_head], then removing last element would make it empty again.

Wait that can't be right because you'd end up with no body segments after moving.

I think perhaps for a snake of length 1 (head only), when you move, the old head becomes part of the body, but since there's no tail to remove, perhaps in this case, the body just remains as [old_head].

Wait, no—the step says:

a. Insert old head into front → body is now [old_head]

b. If not eating apple (step 3c), remove last element.

But if body was empty before, after inserting, it's size 1; then removing the last element would make it empty again.

So effectively, each move shifts the body by one: old head becomes new tail, but for a snake of length 1, this just moves the head and leaves no body behind.

Wait, that can't be right. For a snake of length N, when you move, all segments shift forward, so in the case of length 1, moving would result in the head moving and the old position being vacated—so the body remains empty because there's only one segment (the head).

So perhaps after first move:

- Head: (6,4)

- Body: empty.

Wait no—the movement rules say that when you insert the old head into the front of the body list, but if the snake was length 1, then after moving, the body would have the old head as its only element, and then step 3c says to remove the last element (the tail). But for a single-segment snake, removing the tail (which is the same as the old head) would leave an empty body, meaning the snake is just the new head.

But that seems inconsistent because after one move, the snake should still have its body segments. Wait no—the initial state has no body segments except the head; when you move, you add the old head to the body, but then if it's a normal move (not eating apple), you remove the tail. But in this case, since there was no tail before, perhaps nothing is removed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about how the movement works:

When the snake moves, each segment follows the one in front of it. For a snake with only the head (no body), moving would just change the head's position, and there are no body segments to track. So after the first move, the body remains empty because there was nothing behind.

Wait, but according to step 3a: "Insert old head at front of BODY list". So if the body was empty before, inserting the old head makes it [ (6,5) ].

Then, step 3c says: remove last element from body. But in this case, the body is now [ (6,5) ], so removing the last element would leave an empty body again.

So after first move:

- Head: (6,4)

- Body: empty (since we added (6,5), then removed it).

That seems to make sense for a snake of length 1. So each time you move, you add the old head and remove it if not growing, effectively just moving the head without any body.

Wait no—that can't be right because the snake's body should follow, but in this case, since there's only the head, moving doesn't create a body.

So perhaps after first move:

- Head: (6,4)

- Body: empty.

Then, next moves can proceed as needed.

Now, after moving down once to (6,4), I can choose to go LEFT because current direction is DOWN, and LEFT isn't the opposite of DOWN (opposite would be RIGHT? No—LEFT and RIGHT are opposites; UP and DOWN are opposites). Wait no: if current direction is DOWN, then next move can't be UP. So from DOWN, you can go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

So after first move: DOWN to (6,4), direction now is DOWN.

Wait no—the movement rules say that when you choose a direction, your new direction is the one you chose for that step. Wait no—the direction is determined by how you moved. So if I move DOWN, then my current direction becomes DOWN for the next step.

So after moving DOWN, current direction is DOWN. Then, next move can't be UP (since it's the opposite). So options are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But I need to get left, so perhaps after moving down once, then start going LEFT.

Wait but from (6,4), if I go LEFT, new head would be (5,4).

Check for collision: body is empty because after first move, the body was [ (6,5) ] added and then removed. So no collision.

After second move:

- Head: (5,4)

- Body: Since we moved from (6,4), old head is (6,4). Insert into front of body → body becomes [ (6,4) ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element (which would be nothing in this case because the body was empty before adding (6,4)? Wait no:

Wait, after first move:

- Head: (6,4)

- Body: empty.

Then, second move is LEFT to (5,4).

So step 3a: insert old head (6,4) into front of body → body becomes [ (6,4) ].

Step 3c: remove last element. But the body now has one element [(6,4)], so removing it would leave empty again.

Wait no—the initial body after first move was empty because:

First move:

- Insert old head (6,5) into empty body → [ (6,5) ]

- Remove last element (since not eating apple) → body becomes empty.

So after first move, body is empty.

Then second move: insert old head (6,4) into front of empty body → body becomes [ (6,4) ].

Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty again.

Wait that seems odd. So the snake's body only exists when it grows, i.e., when it eats apples. Otherwise, moving just shifts the head without any body segments.

So in this case, since we're not growing (not eating apples), each move just changes the head position and there are no body segments following.

Therefore, after second move:

- Head: (5,4)

- Body: empty.

But that can't be right because the snake should have a body if it's longer than one segment. Wait no—the initial state has only the head; when you move without eating, the body doesn't grow, so there are no body segments behind the head.

So in this case, after each normal move (without eating), the body remains empty because we're just moving the head forward and not adding any new segments to the body.

Wait no—the movement rules say that when you insert the old head into the front of the body list, but if you don't eat, you remove the last element. So for a snake with only the head (body list is empty), inserting the old head makes it [old_head], then removing the last element would leave an empty body again.

So effectively, each move just moves the head without any body segments unless the snake grows.

Therefore, in this scenario, after moving down and left, the body remains empty until we eat an apple.

But since we're trying to reach the apple at (1,4), perhaps it's better to plan a path that allows us to grow the snake so that we can have body segments to maneuver around.

Wait no—the apple is our target. So when we reach the apple's position, we'll eat it and grow by one segment, adding to the body list without removing anything (since step 3b says if you grow, don't remove the last element).

So let's plan:

Move 1: DOWN from (6,5) → (6,4). Body remains empty.

Move 2: LEFT from (6,4) → (5,4). Body still empty.

But wait, I'm trying to get to (1,4), which is five steps left from x=6. If I just keep moving LEFT each time, that would take five moves.

But after each move, the body remains empty unless I eat an apple. Wait no—the only way to grow is by eating an apple. So if I reach (1,4) on my sixth move (after moving down once and then left five times), that's when I'd eat the apple and grow.

Wait let me outline this:

Move 1: DOWN → (6,4). Body empty.

Move 2: LEFT → (5,4). Body empty.

Move 3: LEFT → (4,4). Body empty.

Move 4: LEFT → (3,4). Body empty.

Move 5: LEFT → (2,4). Body empty.

Move 6: LEFT → (1,4). Now, we've reached the apple's position. So in this step, since we're moving into a cell with an apple, we eat it and grow by one segment.

So after move 6:

- New head: (1,4).

- Insert old head (2,4) into front of body list → body becomes [ (2,4) ].

Since we ate the apple, step 3b says not to remove the last element. So body remains [ (2,4) ].

Now, the snake's body is one segment: [ (2,4) ].

So after eating the apple, the snake's head is at (1,4), and it has a body segment at (2,4).

But wait no—the insertion should be of the old head before moving. Wait when you move, you insert the previous head into the front of the body list. So in move 6:

- Before moving, head was at (2,4).

- You decide to move LEFT to (1,4).

- Insert the old head (2,4) into the front → body becomes [ (2,4) ].

Since you ate the apple (assuming that's where the apple is), you don't remove anything. So after this move:

- Head: (1,4)

- Body: [ (2,4) ]

Now, the snake has two segments: head at (1,4), and body at (2,4).

Wait no—the body list represents all the segments behind the head. So in this case, the body would be [ (2,4) ], meaning that after eating, the snake is longer by one segment.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about how the body list works. Let me clarify:

The body list contains all the segments except the head, ordered from front to back (i.e., the first element is the segment right behind the head, and the last element is the tail).

Wait no—actually, when you insert the old head at the front of the body list, it becomes the new second segment. So if you have a snake that was only the head before, after moving down once:

- Head: (6,4)

- Body: [ (6,5) ]? Wait no, wait.

Wait initial state:

- Head: (6,5). Body is empty.

Move DOWN to (6,4):

- Insert old head (6,5) into front of body → body becomes [ (6,5) ]

Since not eating, remove last element. But the body was inserted with [ (6,5) ], then removed, so body is back to empty.

Wait no—step 3a says insert old head at front; step 3c says if not growing, remove last element.

So for move DOWN:

- Insert (6,5) → body: [ (6,5) ]

- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty again.

Similarly, each time you move without eating, the body remains empty because you add one and then remove it.

Therefore, when you reach the apple at (1,4), that's your sixth move:

Moves:

1: DOWN to (6,4). Body after: empty.

Wait no—initially head is (6,5).

Move 1: DOWN → (6,4)

- Insert old head (6,5) into body → [ (6,5) ]

- Not eating, so remove last element → body becomes empty.

So after move 1:

- Head: (6,4)

- Body: empty.

Move 2: LEFT to (5,4).

- Insert old head (6,4) → body: [ (6,4) ]

- Remove last element → body becomes empty.

After move 2:

- Head: (5,4)

- Body: empty.

Similarly for moves 3-6:

Move 3: LEFT to (4,4). Body remains empty after each step except when eating.

Wait no—only when you eat an apple do you not remove the last element. So if on move 6, you reach the apple at (1,4), then:

Before move 6:

- Head: (2,4)

- Decide to move LEFT to (1,4).

- Insert old head (2,4) into body → body becomes [ (2,4) ]

- Since you're eating the apple, don't remove anything. So after this move:

- Head: (1,4)

- Body: [ (2,4) ]

Now the snake has two segments.

But wait, when moving from (2,4) to (1,4), is there any body in between? No, because before that, all moves didn't add any body segments except this last one where we ate the apple.

So now, after eating, the snake's head is at (1,4), and the body is [ (2,4) ].

Now, if you want to continue moving, say, turn around or something, but since our goal was just to reach the apple, perhaps that's sufficient.

But in this case, we've reached the apple on move 6 by moving down once and left five times. So total moves: DOWN, then LEFT five times.

So the minimal number of moves is six steps: one down, five lefts.

Wait but let me check:

From (6,5), move DOWN to (6,4) → step 1.

Then LEFT to (5,4) → step 2.

LEFT to (4,4) → step3.

LEFT to (3,4) → step4.

LEFT to (2,4) → step5.

LEFT to (1,4) → step6.

Yes, six moves in total.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path if we move LEFT first before moving DOWN. Wait no—because at (6,5), moving LEFT would take us to (5,5). Then from there, we'd have to move down to (5,4), and then continue left four more times, which is also six moves.

So either way, it's six steps.

But wait—can we do better? Is there a way to reach (1,4) in fewer steps?

Wait no because you're moving from x=6 to x=1, which requires five LEFT moves. Plus the one DOWN move. So total of six moves.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves required is six.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest path for a snake starting at position (6,5) on a grid to reach an apple located at position (1,4). The snake can only move up, down, left, or right one cell at a time. 

### Approach
The snake's goal is to navigate from its starting position (6,5) to the target position (1,4) with the fewest moves possible. The minimal path involves moving the snake in such a way that it minimizes the number of steps while avoiding any unnecessary detours or backtracking.

1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at (6,5).
2. **Move Down**: The first move is down to (6,4) because we need to decrease the y-coordinate from 5 to 4.
3. **Move Left**: From (6,4), the snake needs to move left repeatedly until it reaches x=1. This requires moving left five times: from (6,4) to (5,4), then to (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), and finally to (1,4).

Each move down or left counts as one step. Therefore, the snake makes a total of six moves: one move down and five moves left.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the minimal path but does not execute it programmatically.
# The minimal number of steps is calculated as follows:

start = (6, 5)
target = (1, 4)

# Calculate the difference in x and y directions
delta_x = abs(target[0] - start[0])  # 5 steps left
delta_y = abs(target[1] - start[1])  # 1 step down

total_steps = delta_x + delta_y
print(f"Total minimal steps: {total_steps}")  # Output: 6
```

### Explanation
The snake starts at (6,5). To reach (1,4), it needs to:
1. Move down once from y=5 to y=4.
2. Move left five times from x=6 to x=1.

Each move in the y-direction and each move in the x-direction are independent of each other, so the total number of steps is simply the sum of the vertical and horizontal distances. This results in a total of 6 steps (5 lefts + 1 down). 

This approach ensures that the snake takes the shortest possible path to reach the apple without any unnecessary movements.
