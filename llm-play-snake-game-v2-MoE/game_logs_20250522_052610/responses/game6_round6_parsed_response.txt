{"moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"], "reasoning": "To reach the apple at (5,1), we first move the snake downwards to avoid hitting its own body since it's currently at (9, 5). From there, we need to move left four times. This path minimizes the number of moves while avoiding collisions with the snake's body."}
