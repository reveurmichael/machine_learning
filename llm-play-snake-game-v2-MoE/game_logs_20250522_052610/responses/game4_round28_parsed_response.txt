{"moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake can move in any direction except the exact opposite of its current direction. Since the initial direction is not specified, we choose LEFT first to move towards the apple's x-coordinate. After moving left, the snake can either move up or down next. Moving up would put the snake out of bounds (as it's at the edge), so we choose DOWN."}
