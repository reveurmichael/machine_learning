========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left (2 units) and down (8 units) to reach the apple at (3,0). Starting from (5,8), moving LEFT twice avoids immediate body collisions and positions the head at (3,8). From there, moving DOWN sequentially avoids the snake's body (which is mostly to the right and above) until reaching (3,0). Each move is checked for safety against the body's current positions, and the final move to (3,0) is safe as the apple is there. After eating, a legal move (e.g., LEFT to (2,0)) remains possible."
