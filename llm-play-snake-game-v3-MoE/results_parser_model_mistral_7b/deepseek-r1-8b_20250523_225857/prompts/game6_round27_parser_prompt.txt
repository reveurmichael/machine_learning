<think>
Alright, I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake starts at (0,3) and needs to reach the apple at (3,7). The current direction is DOWN. The body cells provided are [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)], so the snake has a head at (0,3), followed by segments at (0,4), (0,5), and (1,5). 

First, I need to understand the movement rules. The snake can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But it can't reverse direction on the first move if the current direction is NONE. Wait, no—actually, the initial direction is given as DOWN, so the first move must be a valid direction that's not the opposite of DOWN. So from DOWN, the next move can't be UP.

Looking at the coordinates, the snake starts near the bottom-left corner. The apple is at (3,7), which is towards the top-right. To get there, the snake needs to move mostly right and up. But let's think about how the snake moves.

The initial position is (0,3). If it moves RIGHT, it goes to (1,3). Then, if it continues moving RIGHT, it can start moving towards the apple. However, the current direction is DOWN, so on the first move, it can't go UP or LEFT; it has to move DOWN or RIGHT.

Wait, no. The initial direction is given as DOWN, so the first move must be in a direction that doesn't reverse. Since it's going down initially, it can't immediately start moving up. But wait, if the direction is NONE, any first move is allowed. In this case, the direction is DOWN, not NONE. So the snake cannot make a U-turn on the first move.

So, from (0,3), the possible moves are DOWN or RIGHT.

If it moves RIGHT to (1,3), that seems like a good start towards the apple. But let's check if there are any obstacles. The body segments are at (0,4), (0,5), and (1,5). So moving to (1,3) is safe because those body parts aren't blocking that path.

But then, from (1,3), what can it do next? It might continue moving RIGHT towards (2,3) and so on. However, the apple is at (3,7), which is up and to the right.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to move UP first. But wait, since the current direction is DOWN, the snake can't immediately switch to UP as that would be reversing. So the first move must be either DOWN or RIGHT.

If it moves DOWN from (0,3), it goes to (0,2). That seems counterproductive because it's moving away from the apple. So perhaps the better initial move is RIGHT to (1,3).

From (1,3), the snake can then start moving UP towards the apple. But moving UP would require checking if that's allowed. Since the current direction was RIGHT, moving UP is not a reversal. So after moving RIGHT to (1,3), it can change direction to UP.

Wait, no. The movement rules state that you cannot reverse unless the current direction is NONE. Wait, actually, rule 2 says you cannot reverse if your current direction is "UP" or "DOWN", but in this case, the initial direction is DOWN, and then moving RIGHT isn't a reversal because the snake's body can pivot.

I think I need to clarify: when the snake changes direction, it can't make an immediate U-turn unless allowed by rule 2. So after moving RIGHT from DOWN, the next move can be UP or continue RIGHT or maybe LEFT, but not DOWN again if that would cause a collision.

Wait, no—rule 2 says you cannot reverse on the first move if your current direction is NONE. But in this case, the initial direction is DOWN, so the first move after that must not reverse. So moving RIGHT isn't reversing; it's changing direction. The rule about reversing only applies to the next move after a direction change.

Wait, no—I think I'm misunderstanding. Rule 2 says: "Cannot reverse: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed."

So if the current direction is DOWN, the next move can be UP or RIGHT or LEFT, but wait, no—actually, moving in the opposite direction of the current would be reversing. So if you're going DOWN and then choose to go UP, that's reversing. Similarly, if you're going RIGHT and then choose to go LEFT.

Wait, no: the rule says if your current direction is "UP", you can't choose "DOWN" next. Similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So in our case, initial direction is DOWN, so we can't reverse by choosing UP as the next move.

So from (0,3) moving RIGHT to (1,3), then the next move can be UP or RIGHT or LEFT? Wait, no—after moving RIGHT, the new direction is RIGHT. So rule 2 applies based on the current direction after each move.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that you can't reverse immediately. So if you're going DOWN and choose RIGHT as your first move, then in subsequent moves, you can change direction freely unless it would cause a reversal.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the path planning.

The snake needs to go from (0,3) to (3,7). The shortest path would be moving right 3 times and up 4 times, totaling 7 moves. But considering the body segments and possible collisions, we need a safe path.

But the initial position has body segments at (0,4), (0,5), and (1,5). So when the snake moves, it can't collide with these parts.

If I consider moving RIGHT first to (1,3), then check if that's allowed. Yes, because (1,3) is empty.

Then, from (1,3), what's next? Maybe move UP to (1,4). Is that allowed? Let me see: after moving RIGHT, the new head is at (1,3), and the body segments are now [old head (0,3)] plus the existing body. So the snake is [ (1,3) as head, then (0,3) as body1 ].

Moving UP would take it to (1,4). Check if that's outside grid? No. Check for collision with any body part except tail when it moves. The tail in this state is (0,5), so moving to (1,4) isn't conflicting.

After moving UP to (1,4), the next move could be RIGHT to (2,4). Then again RIGHT to (3,4), then UP to (3,5), etc., until reaching (3,7).

But I need to make sure that each step doesn't cause a collision with the body segments.

Alternatively, maybe moving in a different path is safer.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, the snake's body grows by one segment. So if the head moves into the apple's position, it grows without removing the tail. That can help in avoiding immediate traps because having an extra segment can provide more flexibility.

But before reaching the apple, the snake must navigate around its own body.

Perhaps a better approach is to move towards the apple while avoiding the body segments and walls.

From (0,3), moving RIGHT is safe. Then from (1,3), UP or RIGHT again.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first isn't possible because it's a reversal. So after moving RIGHT, then the next direction can be UP without violating rule 2.

Wait, no—after moving RIGHT, the current direction is RIGHT. So on the next move, it can choose any direction except LEFT (which would reverse). So from (1,3), it can move UP or RIGHT or DOWN, but not LEFT.

But to reach (3,7), moving UP after moving RIGHT might be a good path.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Initial position: head at (0,3), body at [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)].
2. Move RIGHT to (1,3).
   - Check if this is allowed: yes, as it's within bounds and not occupied by any body part except the head, which moves.
   - So body becomes [ (0,3) at front, then (0,4), (0,5), (1,5) ].
3. Next move: UP to (1,4).
   - Check if this is allowed: yes.
   - Body now has [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5) ].
4. Continue moving UP to (1,5). Wait, but (1,5) is part of the body. So that's a collision.

Oops, can't move to (1,5). So maybe instead, after (1,4), move RIGHT to (2,4).

So step 3: Move RIGHT to (2,4).
   - Check: within bounds.
   - Body becomes [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5) ].
5. Then from (2,4), move UP to (2,5). Is that allowed? Let's see:
   - Current body segments are at (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5).
   - Moving to (2,5) is safe because it's not occupied by any of these.
6. Then from (2,5), move UP to (2,6). Again, check if that's allowed: yes.
7. From (2,6), move UP to (2,7).
8. Then from (2,7), move RIGHT to (3,7): the apple.

Wait, but let me confirm each step for collisions.

After step 1: head at (0,3). Body at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5).

Step 2: move RIGHT to (1,3). Now body is [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5) ].

Step 3: from (1,3), move UP to (1,4). Body becomes [ (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), ... ]. Safe because no collision.

Step 4: from (1,4), move RIGHT to (2,4). Body is now [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), ... ].

Step 5: from (2,4), move UP to (2,5): safe, as body is at (0,3), (0,4), etc., but not blocking (2,5).

Wait, no—wait, the body segments are now [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5) ].

So moving to (2,5): is that conflicting with any body part? No, because none of the body parts are at (2,5).

Then step 6: move UP to (2,6). Safe again.

Step 7: from (2,6), move UP to (2,7). Then move RIGHT to (3,7): apple.

But wait, after moving to (3,7), the snake eats the apple and grows by one segment. So now, the body includes the new segment, which is at (3,7).

Is that a problem? Well, it's allowed because we can have more segments.

So in total, this path would be:

(0,3) → (1,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (2,6) → (2,7) → (3,7)

Wait, that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a more direct route.

Alternatively, from (0,3), move RIGHT to (1,3). Then UP to (1,4). Then UP to (1,5)—but wait, (1,5) is occupied by the body segment. So can't do that.

So maybe after moving UP to (1,4), instead of moving UP again, we should continue moving RIGHT to (2,4).

Then from (2,4), UP to (2,5). Then UP to (2,6). Then UP to (2,7). Then move RIGHT to (3,7).

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient path is possible.

Another approach: from (1,3), instead of moving UP, move DOWN to (1,2), but that seems counterproductive as it's moving away from the target.

So perhaps sticking with moving RIGHT then UP is better.

Wait, let me try again:

After moving to (1,4), can we move RIGHT to (2,4). Then move UP to (2,5), etc. But then, how do we get around the body segment at (1,5).

When we are at (2,4), the body is [ (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5) ].

From (2,4), moving UP to (2,5): safe.

Then from (2,5), move UP to (2,6). Then UP to (2,7). Then RIGHT to (3,7).

That seems feasible.

Alternatively, after reaching (2,4), instead of going all the way up, maybe we can move right first and then up.

But I think sticking with moving up from (1,3) is better because it's closer to the target area.

Wait, but let me consider another path: starting at (0,3), move RIGHT to (1,3). Then RIGHT again to (2,3). But that would require moving right twice, then up. Is that allowed?

From (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3):

After first move, body is [ (1,3), (0,3), ... ].

Second move: from (1,3), moving RIGHT to (2,3). Then from (2,3), need to start moving UP.

From (2,3), move UP to (2,4). Then UP to (2,5), etc.

This seems similar to the previous path but maybe more efficient.

So:

(0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (2,6) → (2,7) → (3,7)

But is this allowed?

After moving to (2,3), the body is [ (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), ... ].

Then from (2,3), move UP to (2,4). That's safe because no body parts are at (2,4).

From (2,4) to (2,5): also safe. Then to (2,6), (2,7), and finally (3,7).

This seems like a solid plan.

So the moves would be:

1. RIGHT to (1,3)
2. RIGHT to (2,3)
3. UP to (2,4)
4. UP to (2,5)
5. UP to (2,6)
6. UP to (2,7)
7. RIGHT to (3,7)

That's seven moves in total.

Wait, but after step 1: (0,3) → (1,3). Body is [ (1,3), (0,3), ... ].

Step 2: (1,3) → (2,3). Now body is [ (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), ... ].

Step 3: (2,3) → (2,4): safe.

Body becomes [ (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), ... ].

Step 4: (2,4) → (2,5): safe. Body is [ (2,5), (2,4), ... ].

Continue up to (2,7).

Then move RIGHT to (3,7).

This path avoids all body segments and seems feasible.

But let me double-check each step for collisions:

- After moving to (1,3): no collision.
- Then (2,3): safe because body is [ (2,3), ... ] but that's the head. Wait: when you move to (2,3), your body becomes [ (2,3) as head, followed by previous segments: (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5) ]. So when moving to (2,3), the tail is still at (1,5). So that's okay.

Then from (2,3) → (2,4): no conflict because body is [ (2,4), ... ] and previous segments are below.

Yes, this seems safe.

Another consideration: can we move diagonally? No, movement is only in four directions.

So I think this path works. Now, let's outline the steps:

1. Move RIGHT to (1,3).
2. Move RIGHT to (2,3).
3. Move UP to (2,4).
4. Move UP to (2,5).
5. Move UP to (2,6).
6. Move UP to (2,7).
7. Move RIGHT to (3,7).

This should reach the apple without colliding with any body segments.

But wait, after moving to (2,7), can we move RIGHT? Because from (2,7), the next position is (3,7). The body at that point would be [ (3,7), ... ] and previous positions are all below or same x-coordinate. So it's safe.

Yes, I think this path works.
</think>

To reach the apple at (3,7) safely without colliding with your own body segments, follow these steps:

1. **Move RIGHT** from (0,3) to (1,3).
2. **Move RIGHT** from (1,3) to (2,3).
3. **Move UP** from (2,3) to (2,4).
4. **Move UP** from (2,4) to (2,5).
5. **Move UP** from (2,5) to (2,6).
6. **Move UP** from (2,6) to (2,7).
7. **Move RIGHT** from (2,7) to (3,7).

This sequence safely navigates around your body segments and reaches the apple without reversing direction in a way that would cause an immediate collision.
