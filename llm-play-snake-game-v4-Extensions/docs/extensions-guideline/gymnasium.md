# Gymnasium Environment Integration for Snake Game AI

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for integrating Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym) environments with reinforcement learning agents in the Snake Game AI project.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

Gymnasium is the maintained successor to OpenAI Gym, providing a standardized API for reinforcement learning environments. The Snake Game AI project implements a **dual approach** strategy:

### **Dual Implementation Strategy**
- **Native Implementations**: Direct integration with Snake Game components
- **Gymnasium Implementations**: Standardized environment interface for RL libraries
- **Cross-Compatibility**: Seamless switching between native and Gym environments

### **Supported RL Algorithms with Gymnasium**

| Algorithm | Native Implementation | Gymnasium Implementation | Primary Use Case |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **DQN** | âœ… Direct integration | âœ… Gym environment | Standard RL workflows |
| **PPO** | âœ… Direct integration | âœ… Gym environment | Policy optimization |
| **A3C** | âœ… Direct integration | âœ… Gym environment | Distributed training |
| **SAC** | âœ… Direct integration | âœ… Gym environment | Continuous control adaptation |

**Gymnasium integration provides a standardized interface for reinforcement learning algorithms while maintaining compatibility with the native Snake Game components, enabling seamless integration with popular RL libraries and frameworks.**
