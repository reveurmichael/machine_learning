========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how the snake can move from (5,8) to eat the apple at (7,5). 

First, I'll note that the head is at (5,8), and the direction is currently LEFT. The body segments are [(6,8), (6,7), (6,6)]. The apple is at (7,5).

The snake can't reverse direction on the first move because the initial direction is LEFT, so it can't immediately turn DOWN or UP. It has to choose between LEFT again or RIGHT.

Let me think about what happens if the snake moves LEFT:

- Moving LEFT from (5,8) would take the head to (4,8). Checking for collisions: The new head isn't outside the grid and doesn't collide with any body parts since the next move would add (5,8) as a new body part. But wait, after moving, the old head becomes the first body segment.

However, the apple is at (7,5), which is to the right of the current position. Moving LEFT seems counterproductive because it's moving away from the apple.

Alternatively, maybe turning RIGHT would be better. Let me see:

If the snake turns RIGHT, the new direction is RIGHT. So the head would move to (6,8). Is that safe? The body is currently [(6,8), (6,7), (6,6)]. Wait, no—the body list provided excludes the head, so the body starts from (6,8) as BODY1. So moving to (6,8) would collide with the first body segment because the head was originally at (5,8). So that's a collision—can't move RIGHT on the first turn.

So the snake can't move LEFT or RIGHT because moving LEFT moves it away from the apple, and moving RIGHT collides with the body. Hmm, that seems like a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The initial position is (5,8), direction is LEFT. So the possible directions for the next move are either LEFT again or RIGHT, but not UP or DOWN because reversing isn't allowed on the first move.

Moving LEFT would take it to (4,8). Then, moving further LEFT could be an option, but that's taking it away from the apple at (7,5).

Alternatively, maybe after some moves, the snake can change direction. But on the first move, it's stuck with either continuing LEFT or turning RIGHT.

Wait, but if the snake moves LEFT to (4,8), then in the next move, it could change direction to UP or DOWN because now the current direction is LEFT. So maybe after moving LEFT once, the snake can turn UP towards the apple.

Let me map out a possible path:

1. First move: LEFT → (4,8)
   - Now the body is [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)]
2. Second move: change direction to UP → (4,9). But wait, moving UP from (4,8) would take y to 9, which is within bounds. Then:
   - Check for collisions: new head at (4,9). No body parts there.
3. Third move: continue UP? Or maybe RIGHT?

Wait, but the apple is at (7,5), so going UP from (4,8) would take it to (4,9), then maybe moving RIGHT towards (7,5).

Alternatively, after moving to (4,8), turning DOWN might be better. Let me see:

1. First move: LEFT → (4,8)
2. Second move: DOWN → (4,7). Check if that's safe. No collision.
3. Then perhaps continue moving DOWN towards the apple.

Wait, but the apple is at (7,5), which is to the right and below. So maybe after turning DOWN, the snake can move DOWN further, but that might not be helpful for reaching the apple.

This seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think about Manhattan distance. The head is at (5,8), apple at (7,5). The difference in x is 2 (to the right) and in y is -3 (down).

So, the snake needs to make more RIGHT moves than LEFT, but also go DOWN.

But on the first move, it can't reverse. So perhaps the initial move should be RIGHT if possible, but moving RIGHT on the first turn collides with the body at (6,8). So that's not allowed.

Wait, the initial direction is LEFT, so turning to RIGHT isn't allowed because reversing direction isn't permitted on the first move. So the snake can only choose between continuing LEFT or staying in place? Or maybe it can change direction if possible.

No, according to the rules, on the first move, the snake cannot reverse direction. So from LEFT, it can choose LEFT again or RIGHT, but not UP or DOWN.

So, moving LEFT is the only option for the first move, which takes it to (4,8). Then, in subsequent moves, it can change direction.

From (4,8), the snake could now choose any direction except turning back to LEFT again. Wait, no—since the current direction is LEFT, but after moving, the direction is still considered as LEFT until it changes.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the direction updates. Each move is made in the current direction unless changed. So if the snake moves LEFT, the next move's possible directions are only LEFT again or RIGHT (since reversing from LEFT to UP/DOWN isn't allowed on the first move). But after that, it can change direction.

So maybe the plan is:

1. Move LEFT once to (4,8)
2. Then turn DOWN
3. Move DOWN to reach y=5 and then x=7

But let's see:

From (4,8), moving DOWN would take it to (4,7). That's safe.

Then from (4,7), the next move could be RIGHT to go towards the apple.

Each step needs to avoid collisions with body parts. Also, after eating the apple, there must be a way to move further.

Let me try mapping this:

1. Move LEFT → (4,8)
   - Direction: LEFT
   - Body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)]
2. Change direction to DOWN
3. Move DOWN → (4,7)
   - Check collision: safe.
   - Body now is [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (4,8)]? Wait, no—the body segments are updated by inserting the old head at front and possibly removing the tail.

Wait, after moving to (4,8), the next move's direction is LEFT again or RIGHT. But if we choose to turn DOWN, that's allowed because it's not reversing from LEFT to UP/DOWN on the first move? No—the first move was LEFT, so on the second move, changing direction to DOWN would be allowed because it's not reversing.

Wait, no: the rules state that you can't reverse. So if your current direction is "LEFT", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "UP" and "RIGHT". So from a LEFT direction, the next move can only be LEFT or RIGHT—can't go DOWN or UP.

Ah, so after moving to (4,8), the snake's direction is still LEFT. Therefore, on the second move, it can choose either LEFT again or RIGHT.

So, to change direction to DOWN, it needs to make a series of moves that allows it to turn without reversing.

Hmm, this complicates things. So from (4,8) with direction LEFT, the next possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT.

If we choose RIGHT:

- Move to (5,8). But wait, moving from (4,8) RIGHT would take it back to the original position (5,8), which is now part of the body. So that's a collision—can't do that.

Alternatively, moving LEFT again to (3,8), then maybe turning DOWN.

But then from (3,8), direction is LEFT, so next move can only be LEFT or RIGHT.

Hmm, this seems like it's going in circles. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.

Perhaps the snake should move towards the apple by first going right as much as possible without colliding with its body, and then turning down.

But given that on the first move, the snake can only choose between LEFT or RIGHT (since reversing is not allowed), moving LEFT takes it away from the apple.

Wait, but maybe after moving LEFT once, the snake can change direction to UP or DOWN. Let me check:

After first move: (4,8), direction still LEFT.

Second move options: LEFT or RIGHT.

If we choose to turn RIGHT now, that would be reversing? No—since current direction is LEFT, turning to RIGHT isn't a reversal because it's changing direction without going against the previous direction. Wait, the rules say you can't reverse. So from LEFT, the next move can't be UP or DOWN—it has to be either LEFT again or RIGHT.

So after (4,8), moving RIGHT would take it to (5,8). But (5,8) is now part of the body because after the first move, the head was at (5,8), which becomes BODY1. So moving back to (5,8) would collide with the body—can't do that.

So, from (4,8), if we choose LEFT again, it goes to (3,8). Then from there, perhaps turning UP or DOWN.

But let's see:

1. Move LEFT → (4,8)
2. Move LEFT → (3,8)
   - Now direction is LEFT
   - Next move can be LEFT or RIGHT
3. Change direction to UP → but that would require reversing? No—since current direction is LEFT, choosing UP next would not be a reversal because it's changing direction.

Wait, no: the rules state that you cannot reverse direction on the first move, but subsequent moves are allowed as long as they aren't considered reverses.

I think the key here is that after the initial move, the snake can change direction without restrictions, except for the rule against reversing on the first move.

So from (3,8), with direction LEFT, next possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. If we choose to turn UP now:

- Moving UP from (3,8) would take it to (3,9). Check collision: safe.
   - Body after this move would be [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (3,8)]
   - Wait, no—each move adds the previous head position as a body part. So moving from (4,8) to (3,8) makes (4,8) a body part. Then, moving to (3,8), that becomes the new head, so the old head (4,8) is still part of the body.

So continuing this way, perhaps the snake can move UP towards y=9 and then turn RIGHT towards x=7.

But the apple is at (7,5), which is lower than y=9. So maybe after moving UP to (3,9), the snake needs to go back down towards the apple.

This seems like a long path, but perhaps it's doable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path by moving DOWN from (4,8). But as per the rules, from (4,8) with direction LEFT, the next move can't be DOWN because that would reverse direction—so not allowed on the first move after initial LEFT.

Wait, no: the rule is that you cannot reverse on the first move. So if your first move is LEFT, then your second move cannot be UP or DOWN—it has to be either LEFT or RIGHT again.

Therefore, from (4,8), you can only choose between LEFT and RIGHT again.

If you choose to go RIGHT to (5,8)—which is now part of the body—collision occurs. So that's not allowed.

Thus, the snake must move LEFT again to (3,8). Then from there, it can change direction without restriction because it's no longer in the first move.

So:

1. Move LEFT → (4,8)
2. Move LEFT → (3,8) (now direction is still LEFT)
   - Next possible directions: LEFT or RIGHT
3. Change direction to UP → moving UP to (3,9). Safe.
   - Now direction is UP
4. Then, from (3,9), change direction to RIGHT → moving to (4,9)
5. Continue moving RIGHT towards the apple.

Wait, but each time you turn, you have to ensure no collisions and that you can eventually reach the apple without getting stuck.

This seems possible, albeit a bit lengthy.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think about what the rules say:

- On the first move, cannot reverse direction.
- After that, any direction change is allowed except for reversing from the previous direction on the immediately next move.
Wait, no—the rules specifically state that you cannot reverse on the first move, but after that, I think direction changes are allowed as long as they're not considered reverses.

So perhaps:

1. Move LEFT → (4,8)
2. Change direction to RIGHT → moving to (5,8). But collision with body—can't do.
3. So instead, from (4,8), move LEFT again to (3,8)
4. Now at (3,8) with direction LEFT
   - Next possible directions: LEFT or RIGHT
   - Let's choose UP → moving to (3,9)
5. From (3,9), now direction is UP, so next move can be any except DOWN.
6. So perhaps change direction to RIGHT → moving to (4,9)
7. Then keep moving RIGHT towards the apple at (7,5).

Each step needs to avoid collisions.

From (3,8) to (3,9): no collision, safe.
From (3,9) to (4,9): safe.
Then from (4,9), move RIGHT each time:

- (5,9)
- (6,9)
- (7,9)

But the apple is at (7,5). So perhaps after getting to (7,9), the snake needs to go down towards y=5.

But going from (7,9) to (7,8) etc. But each time, it has to check for collisions.

Alternatively, maybe a better path would involve moving right and then down without overshooting.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the snake can move RIGHT on the second move by turning at (4,8). Let me see:

1. Move LEFT → (4,8)
2. Change direction to RIGHT → now direction is RIGHT
   - Moving to (5,8): but that's where the body started—collision.
3. So not allowed.

Thus, from (4,8), can't move RIGHT as it would collide with the body.

Therefore, must continue moving LEFT:

1. Move LEFT → (4,8)
2. Move LEFT → (3,8)
   - Now at (3,8) with direction LEFT
3. Change direction to UP → moving to (3,9)
4. Then change direction to RIGHT → moving right towards the apple.

Each step has to be safe and avoid collisions.

Once at (3,9), then moving RIGHT:

- To (4,9): safe.
- To (5,9): check if any body parts are there. The body started as [(6,8), (6,7), (6,6)] and then added (5,8) when first moved LEFT.

Wait, no—after each move, the head becomes part of the body. So after moving from (4,8) to (3,8), the body is [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (4,8)]? No, the initial body was [BODY1: (6,8), BODY2: (6,7), BODY3: (6,6)]. After first move to (4,8), the body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)], and then when moving to (3,8), it's added as the new head, making the body [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)].

Wait, no—each move adds the previous position of the head to the body. So first move: LEFT from (5,8) to (4,8). The new head is (4,8), so the body becomes [(5,8), ...previous body...]. Wait, initial body was [BODY1: (6,8)]. After first move, moving LEFT from (5,8) to (4,8): new body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)].

Then, second move: LEFT again from (4,8) to (3,8). New head is (3,8), so body becomes [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)].

So when moving to (3,9) next, the head is (3,9), added as a new body part.

Wait, no—each move adds the previous head position. So after moving from (4,8) to (3,8), the body includes [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (4,8)]. Then, when moving UP from (3,8) to (3,9), the new head is (3,9), so the body becomes [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (3,8)].

Then moving RIGHT from (3,9) to (4,9): new head is (4,9), so body includes [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (3,8), (3,9)].

Continuing this way, the snake can keep moving RIGHT towards x=7.

Once at (7,9), it needs to go down to y=5 without colliding with its body. Each step down from (7,9) to (7,8), (7,7), etc., as long as those positions are not occupied by the body.

But the body includes all previous head positions, so we need to ensure that when moving down, the new position isn't already in the body.

This might require careful planning. For example:

- After reaching (7,9), check if moving DOWN is safe: y=8, y=7, etc., ensuring each step doesn't collide with existing body parts.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible to reach the apple without needing to go all the way up to (7,9). Perhaps a more direct route exists.

Another approach could be to move RIGHT and then DOWN towards the apple, but considering the initial constraints of direction reversal on the first move.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal path involves:

1. Move LEFT once to (4,8)
2. Then change direction to UP
3. Move UP as far as possible
4. Then turn RIGHT and move right towards the apple at (7,5)

But I need to make sure that each step is safe.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN from (4,8) after the second move, but I think direction reversal is restricted on the first move.

Wait, after moving LEFT twice, the snake can change direction without restriction, so perhaps:

1. Move LEFT → (4,8)
2. Move LEFT → (3,8)
3. Change direction to DOWN → moving to (3,7). Safe?
   - Check body: [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (4,8), (3,8)]
   - Moving from (3,8) to (3,7): safe because (3,7) is not in the body.
4. Now at (3,7). Direction is DOWN
5. Continue moving DOWN towards y=5:
   - (3,6)
   - (3,5)

But then, from (3,5), how to reach (7,5)? Need to move RIGHT again.

So:

1. Move LEFT → (4,8)
2. Move LEFT → (3,8)
3. Change direction to DOWN → (3,7)
4. Continue moving DOWN → (3,6), (3,5)
5. Now at (3,5). Direction is DOWN, but we need to change direction to RIGHT.
   - Since last move was DOWN, next move can't be UP. Can it be RIGHT? Yes, because direction wasn't reversed from the previous non-first move.

So:

6. Change direction to RIGHT → moving to (4,5)
7. Then continue moving RIGHT towards (7,5)

Each step needs to avoid collision with body.

But when moving from (3,5) to (4,5), is that safe? Check body: [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7)]. So (4,5) isn't in the body—safe.

Then continue:

- (5,5)
- (6,5)
- (7,5): reached the apple!

Yes, that seems to work.

So summarizing the path:

1. Start at (5,8). Move LEFT to (4,8).
2. From (4,8), move LEFT to (3,8).
3. At (3,8), change direction to DOWN and move to (3,7).
4. Continue moving DOWN to (3,6) and (3,5).
5. At (3,5), change direction to RIGHT and move to (4,5), then to (5,5), and finally to (7,5).

This path successfully reaches the apple without collisions.

So the sequence of moves is:

LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT

Or in terms of directions: L, L, D, D, D, R, R, R
</think>

The snake must move left twice to get into a position where it can safely move down and then right towards the apple. The final path is:

1. **Move LEFT**: From (5,8) to (4,8)
2. **Move LEFT**: From (4,8) to (3,8)
3. **Change direction to DOWN** and move to (3,7), (3,6), and (3,5)
4. **Change direction to RIGHT** and move to (4,5), (5,5), and finally (7,5)

This sequence ensures all moves are safe and avoids collisions with the snake's own body.

The final answer is:

\boxed{(7,5)}
