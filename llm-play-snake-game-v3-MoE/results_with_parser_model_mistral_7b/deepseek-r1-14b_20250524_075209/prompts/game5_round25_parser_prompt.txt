<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (4,9) to eat the apple at (5,0). Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.

The head is at (4,9), which is near the top-right corner. The body segments are [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7)]. So the snake is going from (4,9) down to the right and then turns left a bit, ending at (1,7). The current direction is "RIGHT", so the snake was moving right before this step.

The apple is at (5,0), which is near the bottom-right. To get there, the head needs to move right once to reach x=5, but also move down 9 times from y=9 to y=0. However, since each move only changes one coordinate by 1, I need a path that avoids colliding with the body and doesn't reverse direction in a way that's forbidden.

First, let's calculate the Manhattan distance between the head and the apple: |5-4| + |0-9| = 1 + 9 = 10. So the snake needs to make at least 10 moves, but since it's growing as it eats apples, I need to plan carefully.

The movement rules say that after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move left. Also, the direction can't be reversed unless it's NONE. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. But wait, no, because "RIGHT" and "LEFT" are reverses, so if I'm currently going RIGHT, I can't choose LEFT on the first move? Wait, no, the rule says you cannot reverse the direction. So if the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.

Wait, but the initial direction is RIGHT, so for the first move, I need to make sure it's not a reversal. Oh wait, no—current direction is RIGHT, which means that the last move was RIGHT. So the next move cannot be LEFT because it's reversing. But the current direction given is "RIGHT", so any move other than LEFT would be allowed except if it's NONE.

Wait, no: the movement rules say you can't reverse directions. For example, if you're moving UP, you can't choose DOWN next. So since the current direction is RIGHT, the next move cannot be LEFT.

But wait, in this case, the initial state has a current direction of "RIGHT". So when making the first move, I can't choose to go LEFT because that would reverse the direction. But the problem statement says you can't reverse on any turn except if it's NONE for the first move. Hmm, but in this case, the snake is already moving RIGHT, so next moves can't be LEFT.

Wait no—the movement rules say "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed."

So in this case, since the current direction is RIGHT, I cannot choose LEFT as the next move.

But the head is at (4,9). The body segments are behind it: [(3,9), (2,9), etc.]. So moving LEFT would take me to (3,9), which is occupied by the first body segment. So that's a collision and death anyway. So even if I wanted to go LEFT, it's not allowed because of the body.

So possible initial moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. But since the head is at (4,9), moving UP would take it to (4,10) which is outside the grid—so that's invalid and leads to death. So only possible moves are DOWN or RIGHT.

But the current direction is RIGHT, so I can't go LEFT. Therefore, for the first move, my options are DOWN or RIGHT.

Wait, but moving RIGHT would take me to (5,9). The apple is at (5,0), which is far away, and (5,9) isn't the apple's position. So that might not be optimal.

Alternatively, moving DOWN from (4,9) takes me to (4,8). That seems safer because it's inside the grid and not occupied by any body segments except perhaps when the body moves.

Wait, let's check if moving down is possible. The current head is at (4,9), so moving down would be (4,8). The body behind is [(3,9), ...]. So (4,8) isn't in the body list, but wait: after moving, the new head is checked against all BODYi except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

In this case, after moving down, the new head would be (4,8). The body segments are [(3,9), (2,9), ...], so none of them are at (4,8). So that should be safe.

So I can start by moving DOWN.

Then, in the next step, what? After moving down to (4,8), the direction is now DOWN. Wait no: when you move, the new direction becomes whatever you choose. So if I choose DOWN as the first move after initial direction of RIGHT, then the current direction would change to DOWN for the next moves.

Wait no: each movement step can be any valid direction except reversing. So after moving DOWN from RIGHT, that's allowed because DOWN is not the reverse of RIGHT (which would be LEFT). So now, the new direction is DOWN.

From (4,8), I can choose any direction except UP (since current direction is DOWN; you can't reverse).

So options are RIGHT, LEFT, or DOWN. Let's think about the path to the apple at (5,0). To get from (4,9) to (5,0), ideally, we need to move right once and down nine times. But since movement is step by step, let me plan a safe path.

Alternative approach: Since moving directly right might lead into the body, maybe I should first clear the path by moving down a few steps to avoid collision, then proceed right when it's safe.

Let me outline possible moves:

1. Move DOWN from (4,9) to (4,8).
2. Then, can move RIGHT or LEFT or DOWN again.

But wait, after moving down once, where are the body segments? The body would have been updated by adding the old head (4,9) as the first body segment, then the rest.

Wait no: when you make a move, the body is updated by inserting the old head at the front of the BODY list. So let me think about how each move affects the body.

Let's simulate the first few steps:

Initial state:
Head: (4,9)
Body: [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7)]
Apple at (5,0).

First move is DOWN, so new_head = (4,8). Check collisions: not outside grid, and (4,8) isn't in the body list except perhaps when the tail moves. Wait, the body list after this move would be:

Insert old head (4,9) at front of BODY, which was [(3,9), ...]. So new BODY becomes [(4,9)] + original body, but then we remove the last element if not eating apple.

Wait, since we're moving normally (not eating apple yet), we add the old head to the front and remove the tail.

So after the first move:

Head: (4,8)
Body: [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)]

Because we inserted (4,9) at front, then removed the last element (1,7).

Wait no: original body is [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7)]. After inserting old head (4,9), it's [ (4,9), 3,9; 2,9; etc.], then since we didn't eat the apple, remove tail: so new body is [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)].

Wait no—because the length remains same unless eating apple. So initial body has 5 segments; after moving down and not eating apple, body becomes [old_head] + body[0:-1], so new body is [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8)].

Wait, original body list is from the input as [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7)], which are 5 elements. After inserting old head at front, it's [ (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7) ], then we remove the last element because not eating apple.

So new body is [ (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7) ] — same length as before. Wait no: original was 5 elements; after inserting one more and removing one, it remains 5.

Wait, no: initial body has N elements. Inserting old head makes N+1, then remove last element to make N again. So yes, same length.

But in this first move, the new head is (4,8), and the body is [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)].

So, after moving down once, the next possible moves are RIGHT, DOWN, or LEFT (but can't go UP because current direction is now DOWN).

Wait, no: after choosing to move DOWN from initial direction of RIGHT, the new direction is DOWN. So for the next move, I can choose any except UP.

But let's proceed step by step:

Move 1: DOWN → head at (4,8). Body: [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)].

Now, where is the apple? At (5,0). So to get there, I need to move right and down. But moving right from (4,8) would take me to (5,8). Is that safe?

Check body segments: after the first move, the body includes (4,9), (3,9), etc., but not (5,8). So it's safe.

So perhaps move RIGHT next.

Move 2: RIGHT → head at (5,8). Check if apple is there? No. Body updates: insert (4,8) at front of current body, which was [(4,9), ...], so new body becomes [ (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8) ], then remove last element because not eating apple.

So new body is [ (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8) ] — but wait, this might be a problem because moving right into (5,8), and the body now includes (2,8).

Wait no: after inserting old head (4,8), then removing last element.

But let's make sure about collisions. The new head is (5,8). Are any of the body segments at (5,8)? Current body after move 1 is [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)]. So no, (5,8) isn't in the body. After inserting old head (4,8) and removing last element (which was (2,7)), new body becomes [ (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8) ].

So moving right is safe.

Now, current direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

Wait no: in move 1, I chose DOWN from initial direction of RIGHT, so now the current direction is DOWN for move 1. Then in move 2, I chose RIGHT, which changes direction to RIGHT, but according to rules, moving from DOWN to RIGHT is allowed because they are not reverses (DOWN and UP are reverses; LEFT and RIGHT are reverses). So as long as you don't reverse the previous direction.

Wait, no. The rule says "If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'." So if current direction is DOWN, you can't choose UP next. Similarly, if current direction is RIGHT, you can't choose LEFT.

So in move 2, after moving to (5,8), direction is now RIGHT, so the next move can't be LEFT.

Proceeding:

Move 3: Now at (5,8). What's next? Need to get down further. So options are DOWN or RIGHT or something else, but current direction is RIGHT, so can't go LEFT.

But moving RIGHT again would take me further right, but I need to reach x=5 and then move down. Alternatively, after reaching (5,9), maybe we can proceed differently.

Wait, the apple is at (5,0). So from (5,8), moving down to (5,7) might be safe.

But let's check body segments after each move.

After move 2: head at (5,8). Body is [ (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8) ].

So moving down to (5,7): new head. Is (5,7) in the body? No. So safe.

Move 3: DOWN → (5,7). Body updates: insert (5,8) at front, then remove last element.

New body is [ (5,8), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9) ].

Wait no: after move 2, body was [ (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8) ]. Then in move 3, we insert old head (5,8) at front, making it [ (5,8), (4,8), ...], and then remove last element, which was (2,8). So new body is [ (5,8), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9) ].

Proceeding:

Move 4: DOWN → (5,6). Check if in body? Body after move 3 is [(5,8), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9)]. So no collision. Safe.

Continue this way until y=0.

But wait, each time we move down, the body updates by adding the previous head to front and removing last element. So after several moves, the body segments will shift accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient path would involve moving right first to (5,9), then all the way down. Let's check if that's possible.

But initially, at (4,9), can I move right? The current direction is RIGHT, so yes. But wait: after move 1, we were moving DOWN; perhaps it's better to plan a path that doesn't require too many turns.

Alternatively, let's see:

Move 1: RIGHT → (5,9). Check body: body becomes [ (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7) ] after inserting old head and removing last. So new body is [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)].

But wait, the initial move from (4,9) to (5,9): check if that's possible.

Wait, current direction is RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT. Moving right would take me to (5,9). Is that position occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail?

Body after inserting old head (4,9) would make the body [(4,9)] + original body [ (3,9), ... ] but then we remove last element.

Wait no: when moving right from (4,9), new_head is (5,9). Check if it's in body segments except possibly the tail after movement.

The body before move was [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7)]. So none of them are at (5,9). So safe to move right.

After moving right:

Head: (5,9)
Body becomes: insert old head (4,9) → [(4,9)] + original body. But since we didn't eat apple, remove last element.

So new body is [ (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7) ].

Now, current direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

From (5,9), I need to get down to y=0. So let's start moving down.

Move 2: DOWN → (5,8). Safe? Body after inserting old head (5,9): [ (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8) ] and then remove last element, which was (2,7).

So new body is [ (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8) ].

Proceeding:

Move 3: DOWN → (5,7). Body becomes [ (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9) ] after inserting and removing.

And so on until y=0. Each time moving down, ensuring that the new head isn't colliding with any body segments except possibly when it's allowed.

This path would require 10 moves: move right once, then down nine times. But each movement step must avoid collision.

Wait, but after each move, the body is updated by adding the previous head to the front and removing the last element unless an apple is eaten.

So, for example:

After moving right once, the body starts at (4,9), then moves down from there. Each subsequent move down adds a new segment in front of the body.

But let's think: will any of these movements cause the head to collide with its own body?

At each step after moving down, the head is at (5,y) where y decreases by 1 each time. The body segments are [old_head, ...]. So as long as none of those old_head positions are on the same x and y as the new head.

But when I move right first to (5,9), then down: each subsequent position is unique in terms of path, so no collision.

Wait, but after moving down a few steps, the body segments include (5,9), (4,9), etc., which are not on the same x=5 and lower y.

So it seems safe. Therefore, the optimal path would be:

1. Move RIGHT to (5,9).
2. Then move DOWN nine times until reaching (5,0).

But wait: can I eat the apple at (5,0)? Or does the movement have to end there? Assuming the goal is just to reach (5,0) without necessarily eating an apple.

Alternatively, if we assume that moving into (5,0) is sufficient, then this path would work.

So the total steps would be 10: right once, down nine times. But perhaps we can do it in fewer steps by avoiding unnecessary turns.

But according to the rules, each move must not cause collision with body segments except at the end point.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves is 10.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake-like entity from its starting position to a target position while ensuring it does not collide with any part of its own body. The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right), and each movement must be carefully planned to avoid self-collision.

### Approach
The goal is to move the snake from the initial position `(4, 9)` to the target position `(5, 0)` without colliding with any part of its body. The approach involves a systematic traversal where we first move right once and then continuously move down until reaching the target.

1. **Initial Position**: Start at `(4, 9)`.
2. **Move Right**: First, move the snake to `(5, 9)` to position it correctly for the downward movement.
3. **Move Down**: From `(5, 9)`, move the snake down one step at a time until it reaches `(5, 0)`. Each move updates the body segments by adding the previous head position to the front and removing the last segment.

This approach ensures that each new head position does not collide with any existing body segments except for the target position.

### Solution Code
```python
def solve():
    # Initial position of the snake's head
    head = (4, 9)
    # Body segments excluding the head
    body = [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7)]
    
    # Target position
    target = (5, 0)
    
    # List to record each move's coordinates
    moves = []
    
    # Check if the initial position is the target (not in this case)
    
    # Move right once to start moving towards the target column
    head = (5, 9)
    body = [(4,9)] + body[:-1]
    moves.append(head)
    
    # Now move down until reaching y=0
    while head[1] > target[1]:
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] - 1)
        # Check collision with current body excluding the last part which will be removed
        if any(new_head == seg for seg in body):
            print("Collision detected at move:", new_head)
            return None
        head = new_head
        body = [head] + body[:-1]
        moves.append(head)
    
    # After reaching target, check if it's the same as head (which it is now)
    moves.append(target)
    
    return moves

# Get the path of movement
path = solve()

if path:
    print("Path achieved without collision:", path)
else:
    print("No valid path found.")
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The snake starts at `(4, 9)` with its body segments initialized to `[ (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7) ]`.
2. **First Move Right**: The head moves from `(4, 9)` to `(5, 9)`. This sets up the snake to move down the target column.
3. **Subsequent Moves Down**: From `(5, 9)`, the snake moves down one row at a time. Each move updates the body segments by adding the new head position to the front and removing the last segment to simulate movement.
4. **Collision Check**: Before each move, we check if the new head position collides with any existing body segments. If a collision is detected, the function returns `None` indicating no valid path.

This method ensures that the snake efficiently moves from its starting position to the target without self-collisions, providing an optimal path in terms of minimal steps and avoiding obstacles.
