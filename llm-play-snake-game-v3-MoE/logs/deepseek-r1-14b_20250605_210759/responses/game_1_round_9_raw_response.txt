========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this Snake problem step by step. The head is at (5,6), and the apple is at (6,7). So, I need to figure out a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds.

First, looking at the current direction, it's "LEFT". That means the next move can't be "RIGHT" because reversing isn't allowed. But wait, actually, no—the problem says you can't reverse. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. Wait, no—current direction is LEFT, so next can't be RIGHT? Or is it that you can't choose the opposite direction.

Wait, the movement rules say: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. But in this case, current direction is LEFT, so the first move can't be RIGHT.

But wait, according to the initial input, the current direction is "NONE"? No, wait, no—the inputs given are: Head position (5,6), Current direction "LEFT", body cells, apple at (6,7). So the snake is moving LEFT. That means when planning moves, the next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, but according to movement rules, if current direction is something, you can't choose its reverse. So since current direction is LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT.

So from (5,6), current direction is LEFT. Next move options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again? Or wait, no—can't reverse, so after moving LEFT, you can't go RIGHT, but you can continue moving LEFT if possible.

Wait, the snake's body is [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]. So the head is at (5,6). The body starts behind it with (6,6), which suggests that the snake was moving LEFT to get there. Wait, but how? Because if the head is at (5,6) and the next body cell is (6,6), that would imply the previous movement was RIGHT, not LEFT.

Wait, this might be a point of confusion. The body list starts with the segment immediately behind the head. So, head is (5,6), then body1 is (6,6). That means the snake's next segment is to the right of the head. So if the current direction is LEFT, but the previous move was RIGHT? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no—the movement rules say that each BODYi is adjacent to its predecessor. So from HEAD (5,6), the first body cell is (6,6), which is to the right. That suggests that the snake's previous direction was RIGHT. But according to the inputs, the current direction is LEFT. Hmm, perhaps there's a mix-up here.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify: when moving, the new head is computed, then the body shifts. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move would be LEFT again unless changed.

But in this case, the snake's body is arranged such that from (5,6), it goes right to (6,6). That suggests that the previous movement was RIGHT. But according to the input, the current direction is LEFT. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the current direction is the last move made. So if the snake's head moved to (5,6) from (6,6), which would be a LEFT move, then the current direction is LEFT. So that makes sense: the body after the head is (6,6), meaning the previous segment was at (6,6), so moving from (6,6) to (5,6) is LEFT.

So in this case, the snake's direction is LEFT, and the next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But wait, moving LEFT would take the head to (4,6), but let's check if that's safe.

Looking at the body cells: after moving, the old head (5,6) becomes part of the body. The new head is (new_head). So when considering collisions, we have to see whether the new head is on any existing body cell except possibly the tail, which might be vacated if not eating an apple.

In this case, the apple is at (6,7), which is one step RIGHT and UP from the current head. The straight path would require moving right twice or up once and right once, but considering direction constraints.

Wait, no—the apple is at (6,7). From (5,6), that's +1 in x (RIGHT) and +1 in y (UP). So to get there, we need one RIGHT and one UP move.

But the current direction is LEFT. The next move can't be RIGHT because reversing isn't allowed. Wait no—the movement rules say you can't choose the reverse of the current direction. Since current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, that's a problem because to get to (6,7) from (5,6), we need to go right once and up once. But since our first possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again, but moving RIGHT is not allowed as the next move.

So perhaps we can't make a direct path if current direction restricts us from choosing RIGHT immediately. Therefore, we might have to find an alternative route that doesn't require immediate right movement.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the movement rules. Let me recheck:

Movement rule 2: Cannot reverse: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT.

So in this case, from (5,6), the next move can't be RIGHT. Therefore, to reach (6,7), which requires moving right once and up once, we need to first change direction away from LEFT to something else.

But how? Since current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT, but can it turn into UP or DOWN?

Wait, the movement rule says you cannot reverse. So if current is LEFT, you can choose any other direction except RIGHT.

So for the next move, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (since moving in the same direction is allowed).

But moving LEFT again would take us to (4,6), which may not be helpful as it moves away from the apple at (6,7). So perhaps moving UP first is better.

So let's consider that:

First move: UP. New head position becomes (5,7). Let's check if this is safe.

The new_head (5,7) should not collide with any body cells except possibly the tail when it moves.

Current body list after inserting old head would be [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), ...]. So new_head is (5,7). Are there any body cells at (5,7)? No. Because current body starts at (6,6) behind the head. So moving UP to (5,7) seems safe.

After moving UP:

- New head: (5,7)
- Body becomes [old_head (5,6), (6,6), ...]
- Then, since new_head is not apple position (apple is at (6,7)), the tail will be removed. So body after this move would be [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)], but wait—the initial body list was 6 segments, and when moving normally, we remove the last one.

Wait no: when not eating apple, after inserting old head at front of BODY, which becomes [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)], and then removing the tail (which is (6,1)), so body becomes [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)].

So after first move UP:

Head: (5,7)
Body: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]

Now, next move. Current direction is now "UP" because we just moved in that direction.

So for the next move, can't reverse to DOWN.

We need to get from (5,7) to (6,7). So we need a RIGHT move.

But since current direction is UP, next move can be any except DOWN. So moving RIGHT is allowed.

So second move: RIGHT. New head position (6,7), which is the apple's location.

Let's check for collision:

When computing new_head after choosing "RIGHT", it would be (5+1,7) = (6,7). Now, we need to check if this new_head collides with any body cell except possibly the tail when it moves.

After first move, the body is [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. The tail is at (6,2). So in this step, new_head is (6,7). Does any of the body cells except the tail's current position collide? Let's see: body cells are at y=6,5,4,3,2. At x=5 and 6. So none are at (6,7), so it's safe.

Additionally, since new_head is at apple's location, we'll eat the apple, so the tail isn't removed this time. Therefore, body after inserting old head would be [(5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)], but since we ate the apple, the tail remains.

Wait no: when you eat the apple, the length increases by one. So in this case, after moving to (6,7), the body would be:

Insert old head (5,7) at front of current body [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)], making it [(5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. But since we ate the apple, the tail isn't removed. So body remains 7 segments.

So in this case, moving UP first, then RIGHT would successfully reach the apple without collision.

But wait, let's double-check:

After first move: head at (5,7). Body is [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. No overlap except old head which becomes part of the body but new_head is at (5,7) which isn't in any current body cells.

Second move: RIGHT to (6,7). Check if any body cells are at (6,7)? No. So collision is fine.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

1. Move UP to (5,7)
2. Then move RIGHT to (6,7), eating the apple.

But let's consider another approach: can we make a different path? For example, moving LEFT first and then somehow turning around, but that seems less efficient as it moves away from the apple.

Alternatively, could we change direction after moving UP?

Wait, no—because after moving UP, the new current direction is UP, so next move can't be DOWN. But to reach (6,7), you need to go RIGHT and then maybe adjust.

But in this case, the two-step path seems feasible.

Another point: when you make the first move UP, your direction becomes UP for the second move. So in that second move, you can choose any direction except DOWN.

Therefore, moving from (5,7) to (6,7) with a RIGHT move is allowed and safe.

So the two moves would be:

1. Move UP
2. Move RIGHT

This should work without any collisions.

The snake needs to move up first to avoid immediate collision restrictions and then right to reach the apple safely.
