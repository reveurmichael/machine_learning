{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "Since the snake cannot move directly down due to its body blocking the path in column 7 from rows 2 to 5, it must make a U-turn by moving sideways and creating space behind itself. First, it moves up once, then it moves right twice, which allows it to move past its own body segments. After repositioning sideways, the snake can now move down towards the apple."}
