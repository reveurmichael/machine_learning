========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (4,2). The current direction is NONE, and the body cells are empty. Let me start by understanding the situation.

First, the head is at (5,5), which is somewhere in the middle of the grid. The apple is at (4,2), so it's a bit to the left and down from the head. I need to plan a path that will allow the snake to reach there without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds.

Since the current direction is NONE, my first move can be any direction except reversing if there was a previous direction, but since it's NONE, all directions are allowed initially. So I can choose LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, or UP for the first move.

Looking at the apple's position, which is (4,2), that's one unit to the left and three units down from (5,5). So ideally, I need to make more downward moves than upward, more leftward moves than rightward.

But wait, starting direction is NONE, so my first move could be LEFT or DOWN. Let me think about which would be better.

If I go LEFT first, that would take the head to (4,5). Then from there, I can start moving down towards (4,2). But let's see: moving left once, then down three times would get us there in four moves without any body segments because initially, the body is empty. That seems straightforward.

Alternatively, if I move DOWN first to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), and continue down. But that might involve more steps. Let's see: from (5,5) moving down once to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then down twice to (4,2). That would be four moves as well.

Wait, but the apple is directly reachable by moving LEFT once and then DOWN three times without any body interference. So maybe that's a better path because it's shorter.

Let me outline this:

1. Move LEFT: new head at (4,5).
2. Then move DOWN to (4,4).
3. Then move DOWN to (4,3).
4. Then move DOWN to (4,2).

That's four moves in total. Since the body starts empty and each move adds a segment except when eating an apple, but since we're not growing, it should be manageable.

Wait, but let me make sure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body. Initially, there are no body segments, so moving LEFT is safe. Then, after first move, the body will have (5,5) added. So next moves would involve checking if the new head position is not in the body except for the tail when it's about to move.

Wait, but since initially, the body is empty, after each move, the body grows unless we eat an apple. But in this case, we aren't eating any apple until the last step.

So let me simulate each step:

1. Move LEFT: new head (4,5). Body becomes [ (5,5) ] because after inserting old head at front of empty body, then since not eating apple, remove tail (which was none, so body remains [(5,5)].

2. Next move DOWN: new head (4,4). Check if it's in the body? The body is now [ (5,5) ] from previous step. So no collision. Then insert old head (4,5) into body front: body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5) ]. Remove tail because we didn't eat apple yet. But since body was length 1 after first move, adding new head makes it 2, then remove tail, so body is [ (4,5) ].

3. Next move DOWN to (4,3). Check collision: body is [ (4,5) ]. New head is safe. Insert old head (4,4) into front: body becomes [ (4,4), (4,5) ]. Remove tail (4,5), so body remains [ (4,4) ].

4. Next move DOWN to (4,2). Check collision: body is [ (4,4) ]. New head is safe. Insert old head into front: body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ]. Remove tail, but since we ate the apple, wait no—wait, in this case, when moving to (4,2), it's the apple position. So after inserting old head, which was (4,3), the body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ] plus new head (4,2). Wait no: let me think again.

Wait, when we choose to move DOWN from (4,3) to (4,2), since that's the apple position, after moving:

- Insert old head (4,3) into body front: so body becomes [ (4,3) ].
- Since new_head is apple, we grow. So instead of removing tail, we keep it.

Wait, but in this case, previous step had a body of length 1 at (4,4). After moving to (4,3), the body is now [(4,3)]. Then when moving to (4,2):

- Compute new_head (4,2).
- Check collision: no, because body is [ (4,3) ].
- Insert old head (4,3) at front of body: body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ].
- Since new_head == apple, we grow: do not remove tail. So body remains as [ (4,3), (4,4) ], and the head is now (4,2). Wait no, after inserting old head, the body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ].

Wait, I think I might be getting confused here. Let me go step by step:

First move: LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5). Body is empty initially.

After first move:
- HEAD is (4,5)
- BODY is [ (5,5) ]

Second move: DOWN to (4,4).
- new_head is (4,4), which is not in the current body [ (5,5) ]
- Insert old head (4,5) into front of body → body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body is [ (4,5) ]

Third move: DOWN to (4,3).
- new_head (4,3) not in current body [ (4,5) ]
- Insert old head (4,4) into front → body becomes [ (4,4), (4,5) ]
- Remove last element → body is [ (4,4) ]

Fourth move: DOWN to (4,2).
- new_head (4,2) == apple.
- Check collision: body is [ (4,4) ], which doesn't include (4,2)
- Insert old head (4,3) into front of body → body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ]
- Since we ate apple, do not remove tail. So body remains [ (4,3), (4,4) ]

Wait, but after eating the apple, the body grows by 1. So initial body before this step was length 1 (from third move). After inserting old head, it becomes length 2, and since we ate apple, we don't remove anything. So final body is [ (4,3), (4,4) ], and head is (4,2).

Wait no, the initial body after third move was [ (4,4) ].

After moving to (4,3):

- Insert old head (4,4) into front → body becomes [ (4,4), (4,5) ]
- Then, since not eating apple yet, remove last element. So body is [ (4,4) ]

Wait, but in the third move, we were moving to (4,3). So after that:

HEAD is at (4,3), and the body is now [ (4,4) ].

Then for fourth move: DOWN to (4,2):

- new_head is apple.
- Check collision: body is [ (4,4) ], which doesn't include (4,2)
- Insert old head (4,3) into front → body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ]
- Since we ate the apple, do not remove tail. So body remains [ (4,3), (4,4) ]

So the new full snake is:

HEAD: (4,2)

BODY1: (4,3)

BODY2: (4,4)

Wait, that seems correct.

But I need to make sure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move next turn. Let me see what happens next.

After eating the apple, the snake is at (4,2) with body [ (4,3), (4,4) ].

What are possible directions from here? The current direction was DOWN for the last move, so next move cannot be UP because that's reversing. So allowed directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But let's see where can we go:

- LEFT: (3,2). Is this safe? Current body after eating apple is [ (4,3), (4,4) ]. So no collision.
- RIGHT: (5,2). Safe as well.
- DOWN: (4,1). Also safe.

So regardless of which direction we choose next, there's a legal move. Thus, the snake isn't trapped after eating the apple.

Therefore, this path seems valid.

Alternatively, what if I had chosen to go DOWN first?

First move: DOWN from (5,5) to (5,4). Body becomes [ (5,5) ].

Second move: LEFT to (4,4). Now body is [ (5,4), (5,5) ], then remove tail → body is [ (5,4) ].

Third move: DOWN to (4,3). Check collision: no. Insert old head (4,4) into front → body becomes [ (4,4), (5,4) ]. Remove tail → body is [ (4,4) ].

Fourth move: DOWN to (4,2). Apple position.

- new_head (4,2) not in current body [ (4,4) ]
- Insert old head (4,3) into front → body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ]
- Since apple eaten, do not remove tail. So body remains [ (4,3), (4,4) ]

Same as before.

But wait, in this scenario, after first move, direction is DOWN, then second move LEFT—could that cause any issues with the movement? No, because each move just adds a new head and removes the tail unless we eat an apple.

So both paths seem to work. But perhaps moving LEFT first is more straightforward since it's closer in one axis.

Another consideration: when moving towards the apple, whether there are any obstacles or if any moves could lead to collision with body segments as they grow.

But in this case, since initially, the body grows only when we move away from the direction of the apple, so no issues arise.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I go LEFT first to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4). Then body is [ (4,5) ].

Next, DOWN to (4,3): body becomes [ (4,4), (4,5) ], remove tail → [ (4,4) ]

Then DOWN to (4,2): apple position. Insert old head into front: [ (4,3), (4,4) ]. So no collision.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, could I go in a diagonal? No, because each move is only one step either up, down, left, or right.

Wait, but what if I took a different route, like moving DOWN more and then LEFT. Let me see:

First move: DOWN to (5,4). Body becomes [ (5,5) ]

Second move: DOWN to (5,3). Check collision? No. Insert old head into front → body [ (5,4), (5,5) ], remove tail → [ (5,4) ]

Third move: LEFT to (4,3). Check collision: no. Insert old head into front → body becomes [ (5,3), (5,4) ], then remove tail → [ (5,3) ]

Fourth move: LEFT to (4,2). But wait, that's two moves left from (5,3) to (4,3) and then (4,2). Wait no, starting at (5,3):

First step after third move is LEFT to (4,3): new head.

Then next step would be another LEFT to (4,2), but let me simulate:

Wait, in this case:

After first three moves, the head is at (5,3) with body [ (5,4) ].

Fourth move: LEFT to (4,3). Check collision? Body is [ (5,4) ], so no. Insert old head into front → [ (5,3), (5,4) ]. Since not eating apple yet, remove tail → body becomes [ (5,3) ]

Fifth move: LEFT to (4,2). Now, new_head is apple position.

- Check collision: body is [ (5,3) ], which doesn't include (4,2).
- Insert old head into front → body becomes [ (4,3), (5,3) ]
- Since we ate the apple, do not remove tail. So final body is [ (4,3), (5,3) ]

But wait, this path took five moves instead of four. So the first approach is better because it's shorter.

Thus, moving LEFT then DOWN three times seems more efficient.

So to summarize:

Moves:

1. LEFT from (5,5) → (4,5)
2. DOWN from (4,5) → (4,4)
3. DOWN from (4,4) → (4,3)
4. DOWN from (4,3) → (4,2)

This is four moves in total.

I need to make sure that none of these steps cause the new head to collide with the body except when it's the tail and about to be removed.

In each step:

- Step 1: Body is empty, so safe.
- After step 1: Body is [ (5,5) ]
- Step 2: Moving DOWN. New head (4,4). Not in body [ (5,5) ]. Safe.
- After step 2: Insert old head (4,5) into front → [ (4,5), (5,5) ], then remove tail → [ (4,5) ]
- Step 3: Moving DOWN. New head (4,3). Not in body [ (4,5) ]. Safe.
- After step 3: Insert old head (4,4) into front → [ (4,4), (4,5) ], remove tail → [ (4,4) ]
- Step 4: Moving DOWN. New head (4,2). Apple position. Check collision with body [ (4,4) ]? No.
- After step 4: Insert old head (4,3) into front → [ (4,3), (4,4) ]. Since we ate apple, do not remove tail.

Thus, this path is safe and effective.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, will there be any immediate collision? Let's check:

After step 4, body segments are at (4,3) and (4,4). So from new head (4,2), can we move anywhere?

Next direction cannot be UP because that would reverse the last move which was DOWN. Wait no, current direction after step 4 is DOWN? No, wait, each move's direction becomes the current direction.

Wait, after moving LEFT in step 1, direction is LEFT.

Then step 2: direction is DOWN.

Step 3: direction is DOWN.

Step 4: direction is DOWN.

So next possible directions cannot be UP because that would reverse the last move (DOWN). So allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But from position (4,2), moving LEFT takes us to (3,2), which is safe. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) is also safe. Moving DOWN to (4,1) is also safe.

Thus, no immediate collision issues after eating the apple.

Therefore, this path seems valid.
</think>

The snake can move left and then down three times to reach the apple without colliding with its body. Here's the optimal sequence of moves:

1. Move LEFT
2. Move DOWN
3. Move DOWN
4. Move DOWN

**Answer:** \boxed{LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN}
