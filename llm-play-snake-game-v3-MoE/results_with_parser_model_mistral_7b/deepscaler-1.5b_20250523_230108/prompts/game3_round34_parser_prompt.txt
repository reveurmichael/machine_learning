<think>
Okay, so I need to help plan a safe path for the snake's head from (4,4) to eat an apple at (7,4). The snake's body is given as [(5,4), (6,4)], which means it has three segments: the head at (4,4), then two body parts. Wait, no—wait, the list of body cells is from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So the input says "Body cells: [(5,4), (6,4)]". Since the snake's full S is [Head, Body1, Body2], but here only two body segments are given. Wait, perhaps that's just the immediate body parts after the head? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

The problem states that the snake's body cells list includes all segments from behind the head to the tail. So for example, if the snake has head at (4,4) and body1 at (5,4), body2 at (6,4), etc., then perhaps in this case, the given body cells are [Body1, Body2], but since it's ordered from behind the head to tail, maybe the order is important.

But perhaps I should focus on the movement rules rather than getting stuck on that for now. The key points are:

- The snake starts at (4,4), and needs to reach (7,4). So in terms of x-coordinate, it's moving right from 4 to 5, then maybe further to 6 or even beyond if possible.

Wait, but the grid is 10x10. Wait, no—the head is already at (4,4), and the apple is at (7,4). So perhaps the snake needs to move in such a way that it can reach (7,4) without colliding with itself or its body.

But let's think step by step.

First, the snake's initial state is [Head=(4,4), Body1=(5,4), Body2=(6,4)]? Wait, no. Because in the given input, the body cells are [(5,4), (6,4)]. But perhaps since it's ordered from behind the head to tail, maybe the order is such that each segment is adjacent. So if the head is at (4,4), then the next segment would be either (3,4) or (5,4). Wait, but in this case, the body cells given are [(5,4), (6,4)], which suggests that after the head, the first body part is (5,4), then (6,4). But since it's ordered from behind the head to tail, perhaps the order should be reversed. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me focus on the movement rules and the example given.

The snake starts at (4,4) with body cells [(4,3), (4,2)]? Wait no—wait, in the input it's "Body cells: [(5,4), (6,4)]". So perhaps the initial body segments are after the head. Let me clarify:

The full snake S is [Head, Body1, Body2,...]. The given body cells list is from behind the head to tail. So if the head is at (4,4), then the next segment would be behind it, which could be either (3,4) or another cell.

But perhaps for this problem, since we need to move from (4,4) to (7,4), perhaps the snake can move directly right without worrying about body segments because the initial body is at (5,4) and (6,4). Wait no—because in the example given earlier, when moving left, the new head was (3,4), which didn't collide.

But perhaps let's think about the required path. The snake needs to move from (4,4) to reach (7,4). Since it's a straight line rightwards on x=4 and y=4? Wait no—because the apple is at (7,4), so moving along x-axis from 4 to 7.

But perhaps the snake can move in such a way that each step moves it one unit to the right. So let's outline possible moves.

The head starts at (4,4). The direction is "LEFT" because in the movement example, choosing "LEFT" resulted in new_head=(3,4), which didn't cause collision as the body was behind.

But perhaps since the initial direction isn't given, we need to determine it based on the problem constraints. Wait, but the input doesn't specify the current direction; instead, we have to plan a path that leads from (4,4) towards (7,4).

Wait, perhaps the snake can move straight right without any body blocks because the initial body is at (5,4), so moving right would take it into cells that are already occupied by the body. So perhaps the first step should be to find a path where each step moves forward in x or y direction without overlapping with the body.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what needs to happen:

The snake starts at (4,4). It has two body segments: (5,4) and (6,4), meaning that it occupies these cells along with the head at (4,4)? Wait no—because the full snake S is [Head, Body1, Body2], so perhaps in this case, the body segments are [(5,4), (6,4)], meaning that the snake's body consists of those two cells plus the head. But wait, the problem says: "The provided Body cells list includes the segment immediately behind the head to the tail." So if the given body cells are [(5,4), (6,4)], then perhaps the full S is [Head=(4,4), Body1=(5,4), Body2=(6,4)]. That makes sense because each subsequent cell is adjacent.

So the snake's body starts at (4,4) as head, followed by (5,4) and (6,4). Wait no—because in the full S, the order is [Head, Body1, Body2], so perhaps the given body cells are from behind the head to tail. So if the snake has three segments: head at (4,4), then the next two are (5,4) and (6,4). Therefore, when moving, each step will add a new segment.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Let's proceed with movement planning.

The goal is to move from (4,4) to (7,4). The snake needs to reach the apple at (7,4).

Since the apple is at (7,4), which is two cells to the right of the head's starting position. So perhaps the snake can move directly right each step.

But we need to ensure that the path doesn't cause any collisions with itself or body segments.

First, let's outline possible moves:

From (4,4), moving right would take it to (5,4). But if the next segment is (5,4), then moving into it would collide. Wait no—because in the initial state, the snake has a head at (4,4) and body cells at (5,4) and (6,4). So moving right from (4,4) to (5,4) would cause a collision because (5,4) is part of the body. Therefore, perhaps we need to move left first.

Wait no—because if the snake moves left to (3,4), then check for collisions. The new_head is (3,4). Then, since it's moving from (4,4) to (3,4), which is a right movement? No, wait—the direction would be "LEFT" because moving from (4,4) to (3,4) is left.

But perhaps let's think step by step:

1. Current position: (4,4). Direction: Let's assume it's initially facing towards the apple, so perhaps "RIGHT".

2. Compute new_head as (4+1,4)=(5,4).

3. Check if new_head is outside grid—no.

4. Check for collisions with body segments:

   The body cells are [(5,4), (6,4)]. So when moving to (5,4), which is part of the body, would that be a collision? Because in movement rules, if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about whether the new head position is already occupied by any body segment.

In this case, moving from (4,4) to (5,4), which is a body segment, would cause a collision because it's part of the snake's body. Therefore, perhaps we need to move in another direction first.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is "RIGHT", but let's see:

If current direction is "RIGHT", then new_head would be (5,4). But since (5,4) is part of the body, moving to that position would cause a collision. Therefore, perhaps we need to move in another way.

Alternatively, maybe the initial direction isn't given, so perhaps we can choose any valid direction as per the rules.

But perhaps let's think about how the snake moves step by step:

We need to reach (7,4). Starting from (4,4), moving right two steps would take us to (6,4) and then to (7,4). But perhaps that's too straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can move directly towards the apple without any body blocks because the initial body is behind the head.

Wait no—because if the snake moves right each time, it will step on its own body segments. For example:

- Step 1: Move to (5,4), which is part of the body. Collision occurs. So can't do that.

Therefore, perhaps we need to find a way to move without stepping into the body.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can move in a path that doesn't require immediate body blocks.

Wait, perhaps let's outline possible moves:

We start at (4,4). Possible directions: Let's assume initial direction is "LEFT", but then check for collisions. Or maybe it's better to think about what movement would allow us to reach the apple without colliding with itself or other parts of the body.

Alternatively, perhaps since the snake's body includes [(5,4), (6,4)], and the head is at (4,4), moving right from (4,4) would take it into (5,4), which is part of the body. Thus, we need to find another way.

Perhaps the initial direction is "LEFT", but let's see:

If current position is (4,4), and choosing direction "LEFT" results in new_head=(3,4). Then check for collisions with body segments [(5,4), (6,4)]? No collision because (3,4) isn't part of the body. So that seems acceptable.

But perhaps moving left first would allow us to avoid immediate collision.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of required steps:

We need to move from x=4 to x=7 on y=4. Each step increases x by 1 (assuming direction is "RIGHT"). But if the snake moves right each time, it will step into its own body segments because the initial body is at (5,4) and (6,4). So perhaps we need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake can move up or down to avoid immediate collision. Wait no—the apple is at y=4, same as the head's starting position.

So perhaps let's outline possible paths:

Option 1: Move right step by step.

From (4,4) → (5,4): collision with body.

Cannot do that.

Therefore, need to find a path where each step moves into an empty space.

Perhaps move up first? But if moving from (4,4), perhaps it's better to think about the direction. Wait, maybe we can choose "UP" or another direction first.

Alternatively, perhaps since the initial body is [(5,4), (6,4)], the snake can start by moving in a way that doesn't require immediate collision.

But perhaps this approach isn't working; let's try to outline all possible moves step by step.

Let me think about what each movement would involve:

1. The snake starts at (4,4). Let's denote this as position P0 = (4,4).

2. Current direction: Let's assume it's "RIGHT" initially because that might take us closer to the apple.

3. Compute new_head by moving in current direction from P0.

   For example:

   - If direction is RIGHT, new_head would be (5,4).
   
   Check if this position is within grid and not already occupied by any body segment or other parts of the snake.

   In our case, since the snake's initial body includes (5,4) as Body1. Therefore, moving to (5,4) from (4,4) in direction RIGHT would result in a collision because (5,4) is part of the body. Thus, this move isn't allowed.

Therefore, perhaps we need to change direction before making that move.

Alternatively, if current direction is "LEFT", then new_head would be (3,4). Check for collisions:

   - Is (3,4) already occupied by any body segment? Since the initial body includes [(5,4), (6,4)], it's not. So no collision. Thus, this move is allowed.

Therefore, perhaps we should choose direction "LEFT" first to avoid immediate collision.

So step 1: Move from (4,4) → (3,4), direction="LEFT".

Now, the snake's body becomes [(3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]? Wait no—because in the full S, it should be [Head, Body1, Body2]. So perhaps after moving left to (3,4), the new_head is (3,4). Then, since the new_head isn't part of any body segment yet, we proceed.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with how the body segments are tracked. Let's try to model this differently:

Each time the snake moves, it adds a new body segment in front of itself. So if after moving left from (4,4) to (3,4), the current head is at (3,4). Then, adding a new body segment behind? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps let's think that each movement step adds a new body segment in front of the snake. Therefore:

- Initial state: [Head=(4,4)], but wait no—because according to the problem statement, the Body cells list includes from behind the head to tail. So perhaps the initial snake has three segments: (4,4) as head, and two body segments at (5,4), (6,4).

But perhaps this is getting too detailed.

Let's try a different approach:

We need to move from (4,4) towards (7,4). The required movement is 3 steps right. But each step may involve moving into new areas without colliding with the body segments.

Since the initial body includes [(5,4), (6,4)], perhaps we can plan a path that avoids these cells as much as possible.

Therefore, let's outline possible steps:

Step 1: Move from (4,4) to (5,4). But this is part of the body. So collision occurs. Thus, invalid.

Alternative approach:

Perhaps move in another direction first.

Suppose we choose direction "UP" or "DOWN".

If direction is DOWN, new_head would be (5,4), which again is part of the body.

Similarly for "LEFT", as discussed earlier.

Thus, perhaps it's better to start moving right from (4,4) but find a way around the initial body segments.

Alternatively, perhaps think about moving in such a way that each step moves into new areas without overlapping with existing body segments.

But perhaps since we need to reach y=4 and x>=7, maybe the minimal path is moving right two steps first, then up. But perhaps let's outline possible movement sequences:

Option 1: Move right twice, then up three times? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps move in a straight line towards (7,4) by taking steps that avoid body blocks.

But since this seems complicated, perhaps it's better to look for the minimal path and see if it can be done without collision.

Let me try to outline possible moves step by step:

1. Starting position: (4,4). Current direction is "RIGHT".

2. Compute new_head as (5,4).

3. Check collisions with body segments [(5,4), (6,4)]? Wait no—since the initial head is at (4,4) and the first body segment is at (5,4). So moving to (5,4) would cause collision because it's part of the body.

Therefore, perhaps choose a different direction first.

Option: Move "LEFT" from (4,4) to (3,4).

Check for collisions:

- New_head=(3,4). Is this position occupied by any body segment? The initial body is [(5,4), (6,4)], so no. Thus, allowed.

Proceed with moving left to (3,4).

Now, the snake's current head is at (3,4). The new body segments are added as we move.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of steps:

Step 1: Move from (4,4) → (3,4), direction="LEFT".

Step 2: Now, need to reach y=7. Wait no—since the apple is at y=4, same as starting point. So perhaps moving up would be better.

But perhaps let's find a path that allows movement towards y=7 without colliding with body segments.

Alternatively, maybe after moving left once, we can move forward in another direction.

This approach might not be efficient, but perhaps it's necessary to proceed step by step.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to outline all possible moves and see which path leads us closer to the apple without collisions.

But perhaps since this is time-consuming, let me try to think of a more systematic way:

The snake needs to move from (4,4) towards (7,4). Each step must be such that moving into new positions doesn't cause collision with existing body segments or itself.

Given that the initial body includes [(5,4), (6,4)], perhaps we can plan movement as follows:

- Move right once: but wait, since moving from (4,4) to (5,4) would collide. Thus, need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps move down first? Let's see:

If current direction is "DOWN", new_head would be (5,4), which is part of the body. So collision occurs.

Thus, perhaps that's not possible.

Therefore, perhaps the initial step should be to move in a different direction, such as LEFT or RIGHT but find a way around the initial body segments.

Alternatively, perhaps think about moving up after some steps.

But maybe it's better to consider that since we need to reach y=7 from y=4, perhaps we can increase x by 3 and leave y at 4.

Thus, plan:

Move right three times: but each time check for collisions.

Wait no—since the initial body includes (5,4) as Body1. So moving to (5,4) would collide with Body1. Therefore, perhaps need a different path.

Alternatively, perhaps move in such a way that after moving left once, we can proceed upwards without collision.

But perhaps let's outline possible movement sequences:

Option 1: Move right twice, then up three times.

Let me check each step:

Step 0: (4,4)

Move direction "RIGHT" to (5,4) → collision with Body1. Not allowed.

Thus, choose a different initial direction.

Alternatively, move "LEFT" from (4,4) to (3,4), then proceed upwards.

Step 1: Move LEFT to (3,4).

Now, check for collisions:

- Any body segments? The initial body is [(5,4), (6,4)], so no. Proceed.

Step 2: Now need to reach y=7 from y=4 in three steps.

But perhaps moving up each time would require avoiding the body blocks.

Thus:

Move "UP" to (3,5).

Check for collision: Is (3,5) part of any body segments? Initially no. Proceed.

Step 3: Move "UP" to (3,6).

Again, check collision: No. Proceed.

Step 4: Move "UP" to (3,7). Now at y=7, which is the apple's position.

But need to ensure that each step didn't collide with any previous body segments or other parts of the snake.

In this case:

- After moving from (3,4) → (3,5), then (3,6), then (3,7). Each move increases y by 1 without colliding with initial body [(5,4), (6,4)] and previous steps.

Therefore, perhaps this is a valid path.

Thus, the movement sequence would be:

- Start at (4,4).

- Move LEFT once to (3,4).

- Then move UP three times: (3,5) → (3,6) → (3,7).

But wait—this might not account for all possible steps. Perhaps we need to consider that the snake can choose different directions as it moves.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is:

Start at (4,4), move RIGHT once to (5,4)—but collision occurs. So instead, move DOWN first?

Wait no—the problem states that each movement step must be in some direction, but doesn't specify any constraints on direction. However, perhaps it's better to proceed as per the earlier plan.

Thus, perhaps the minimal path is moving left once to (3,4), then up three times to reach y=7 at x=3.

But wait—since we need to move from x=4 to x>=7, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe after moving left once, proceed right again without collision.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to outline all possible moves step by step:

Given that initial body is [(5,4), (6,4)], and the snake starts at (4,4).

We need to reach y=7 with x>=4? Wait no—since the apple is at y=4. So perhaps moving right three times.

But since movement from (4,4) requires avoiding initial body segments.

Thus, perhaps a better approach is:

Start at (4,4), move RIGHT once to (5,4)—but this causes collision with Body1 [(5,4)]. Thus, can't do that.

Therefore, alternative plan: Move LEFT first.

Move LEFT from (4,4) → (3,4). Now check for collisions: no body segments yet. Proceed.

Now, need to get closer to x=7 or something else.

But perhaps after moving left once, proceed upwards without using the initial body blocks.

Thus:

Step 1: Move LEFT to (3,4).

Step 2: Now move UP to (3,5). Check for collision with any segments? No. Proceed.

Step 3: Move UP to (3,6). Check for collision—no. Proceed.

Step 4: Move UP to (3,7). Now at the apple's position. But we need to ensure that this path doesn't cause any collisions.

But perhaps after moving up three times from y=4, reaching y=7, but since initial body is at y=4, x=5 and x=6, perhaps it's okay as long as we don't occupy those positions again.

Thus, perhaps the movement sequence would be:

(4,4) → (3,4) [LEFT], then up three times to (3,7).

But wait—since moving from (3,4), each step increases y by 1. So after three steps, reach (3,7). But let's check if these positions are part of any body segments.

The initial body is [(5,4), (6,4)], which doesn't interfere with the movement to higher y-values as long as they don't land on x=5 or 6 again. Since we're moving up along x=3 each time, perhaps no collision occurs.

Therefore, this seems like a valid path:

1. Move LEFT once from (4,4) → (3,4).

2. Then move UP three times to reach y=7 at x=3: positions (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). Wait, no—each step increases y by 1.

Thus, starting from (3,4):

- Move UP once: (3,5)

- Move UP again: (3,6)

- Move UP a third time: (3,7).

But wait, after moving from (3,4), perhaps the first move is to up to (3,5). Then next step to (3,6), then to (3,7).

Thus, in total:

(4,4) → (3,4) [LEFT]

Then (3,4) → (3,5) [UP]

(3,5) → (3,6) [UP]

(3,6) → (3,7) [UP]

But perhaps this is not the only possible path. Alternatively, after moving LEFT to (3,4), move UP three times: from y=4 to y=7.

Thus, let's outline all steps:

1. Position: (4,4)

2. Move LEFT → (3,4) [step 1]

Now, position is (3,4).

Check for collision with any body segments:

- Initial body is [(5,4), (6,4)], so no.

Proceed to step 2.

Step 2: Move UP from (3,4) → (3,5)

Check for collision:

- Is (3,5) part of any body segment? The initial body has only (5,4), (6,4). So no. Proceed.

Position now is (3,5).

Proceed to step 3: Move UP → (3,6)

No collision with body segments [(5,4), (6,4)]. Proceed.

Step 4: Move UP → (3,7)

Now at y=7, which is the apple's position. Check if any collisions:

- Since we're moving up along x=3 from y=4 to y=7, none of these positions are part of initial body segments [(5,4), (6,4)]. Therefore, this move is valid.

Thus, total steps taken: 1 (LEFT) + 3 (UP) = 4 moves. Wait no—each step is a single movement, but perhaps it's more accurate to count each direction as one step.

But in any case, the path seems feasible.

Therefore, the plan is:

- Move left once from (4,4) → (3,4).

- Then move up three times: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).

This should take us to the apple's position without colliding with any body segments or other parts of the snake.

Thus, this seems like a valid solution.
</think>

The snake can navigate towards the apple by moving left once and then up three times, avoiding initial body blocks. The path is as follows:

1. Move from (4,4) to (3,4).
2. Then move up to (3,5), (3,6), and finally (3,7).

This ensures the snake reaches the apple at (3,7) without collisions.
