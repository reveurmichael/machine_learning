# Setting Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Release Functionality

In this session, we will guide you through setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. Additionally, we will add release functionality to your GitHub repository. This setup ensures that every time there's a push or pull request to the `main` branch, your training data is updated, a new linear model is generated, and a release is created automatically. This hands-on approach will help you understand practical CI/CD workflows and release management.

## 1. Creating the GitHub Actions Workflow

We will create a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch. This workflow will check for changes in the `training_data.csv` file, train a linear model if changes are detected, push the updated model to the `release` branch, and create a new GitHub release.

### .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml

```yaml:
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Check for changes in training_data.csv
        id: check_changes
        run: |
          if git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.before }} ${{ github.sha }} | grep 'training_data.csv'; then
            echo "changed=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "changed=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

      - name: Train Linear Model
        if: steps.check_changes.outputs.changed == 'true'
        run: |
          python train_model.py

      - name: Commit and Push Linear Model to Release Branch
        if: steps.check_changes.outputs.changed == 'true'
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git checkout release
          git merge main
          git add linear_model.txt
          git commit -m "Update linear model"
          git push origin release

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        if: steps.check_changes.outputs.changed == 'true'
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: v${{ github.run_number }}
          release_name: Release v${{ github.run_number }}
          body: "Automated release generated by CI/CD pipeline."
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Explanation:

- **Triggers (`on`)**: The workflow is triggered on both `push` and `pull_request` events to the `main` branch.
  
- **Jobs**:
  - **Checkout repository**: Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to clone your repository.
  
  - **Set up Python**: Sets up Python version `3.9` using `actions/setup-python@v4`.
  
  - **Install dependencies**: Installs Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
  
  - **Check for changes in `training_data.csv`**: Determines if `training_data.csv` has been modified in the latest commit.
  
  - **Train Linear Model**: If `training_data.csv` has changed, this step runs the `train_model.py` script to train the model.
  
  - **Commit and Push to Release Branch**: Commits the updated `linear_model.txt` to the `release` branch.
  
  - **Create GitHub Release**: Creates a new GitHub release with a version tag corresponding to the workflow run number.

## 2. Implementing the Training Script

The `train_model.py` script trains a linear model using the updated `training_data.csv` and outputs the model coefficients to a text file.

### train_model.py

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

# Load training data
data = pd.read_csv('training_data.csv')
X = data.iloc[:, :-1]
y = data.iloc[:, -1]

# Train linear model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Save the model
joblib.dump(model, 'linear_model.pkl')

# Save model coefficients to text file
with open('linear_model.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'Coefficients: {model.coef_}\nIntercept: {model.intercept_}\n')
```

### Explanation:

1. **Loading Data**: The script reads the `training_data.csv` file using `pandas`.
2. **Training the Model**: It trains a `LinearRegression` model using scikit-learn.
3. **Saving the Model**: The trained model is saved as `linear_model.pkl` using `joblib`.
4. **Saving Coefficients**: The model's coefficients and intercept are written to `linear_model.txt`, which will be pushed to the `release` branch.

---

## 3. Adding Dependencies

Ensure that all necessary Python packages are listed in your `requirements.txt` so that the workflow can install them.

### requirements.txt

```text
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
```

---

## 4. Initializing the Release Branch

Before the workflow can push updates to the `release` branch, ensure that this branch exists in your repository.

### Initializing the Release Branch

```bash
git checkout -b release
git push origin release
```

### Explanation:

1. **Create Release Branch**: Creates a new branch named `release` based on the current `main` branch.
2. **Push to Remote**: Pushes the `release` branch to the remote GitHub repository.

---

## 5. Configuring GitHub Releases

The workflow is set to automatically create a new release each time the `linear_model.txt` is updated and pushed to the `release` branch. This automates the release process, ensuring that your repository always has the latest model available.

### Key Points:

- **Tagging**: The release is tagged with `v${{ github.run_number }}`, which increments with each workflow run.
  
- **Release Name**: Similarly, the release name corresponds to the tag.

- **Release Body**: A brief description `"Automated release generated by CI/CD pipeline."` is added to the release.

- **Access Token**: The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is used to authenticate the release creation.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Customizing Releases**: You can modify the `tag_name`, `release_name`, and `body` fields to include more detailed information or follow a specific versioning scheme.
  
- **Draft Releases**: If you want to create draft releases instead of published ones, set `draft: true`.

- **Prereleases**: To mark releases as prereleases, set `prerelease: true`.

---

## Summary

By following these steps, you will have set up a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that:

- **Automates Model Training**: Automatically retrains your linear model whenever `training_data.csv` changes.
  
- **Manages Releases**: Pushes the updated model to the `release` branch and creates a new GitHub release, ensuring that the latest model is always available.
