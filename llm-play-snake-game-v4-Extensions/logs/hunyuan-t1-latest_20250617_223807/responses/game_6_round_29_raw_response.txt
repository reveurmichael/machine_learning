========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": [],
"reasoning": "The snake's head is at (7,0) with a body blocking the direct left path along y=0 to the apple at (2,0). The body occupies (3,0)-(7,0) and extends upward along x=3 to (3,8), then right to (9,8) and down to (9,4), creating a barrier that blocks all safe paths to the apple. Moving left from the head is blocked by the body, and alternative routes around the body's upper segments also collide with the body or grid boundaries. No valid sequence of moves avoids collisions and reaches the apple."
