BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (2,0) to eat the apple at (7,7). Let's see... The current direction is DOWN, and the body cells are [(2,1)]. So the snake's head is at (2,0), then it goes down to (2,1), which is the only body segment. 

First, I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause a collision with the walls or any part of the body except possibly the tail when moving. Also, I can't reverse direction immediately because the current direction is DOWN. So my first move can't be UP. 

Looking at the head's position (2,0), which is near the bottom-left corner. The apple is at (7,7), which is the top-right. To get there, the snake needs to move right several times and then up. But since it's starting by moving DOWN, I need to change direction carefully.

Wait, actually, the head is currently facing DOWN, but if I choose a new direction, I can't reverse. So if the current direction is DOWN, my next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? No, wait, the movement rules say you cannot reverse. So from DOWN, I can choose UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait no, the movement rules state that you cannot reverse. If current direction is DOWN, you can't choose UP next. Because that's reversing.

Wait, the movement rule says: "Cannot reverse": if current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So from DOWN, I can't go to UP next. So possible directions after DOWN are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait, but if the current direction is NONE, any first move is allowed. But in this case, the current direction is DOWN, so the next move can be any except UP.

Wait no, wait: The rule says that you cannot reverse. So from DOWN, you can't go to UP. You can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue going DOWN again? Wait, but if you're already moving in a direction, choosing it again is allowed because it's not reversing. Reversing would be like UP after DOWN.

So the initial move options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since current direction is DOWN). But wait, since we can't reverse, which would be going UP from DOWN, but other directions are allowed.

Wait, no: Reversing means choosing the opposite direction. So if you're moving DOWN, you can't choose UP next; same for LEFT and RIGHT.

So initial possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since current is DOWN). But wait, in the first move, since we're starting with a certain direction, I think it's allowed to change direction as long as it's not reversing. So from DOWN, next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or any other except UP.

But also, considering that the snake is at (2,0). Moving DOWN would take it to (2,-1), which is out of bounds, so that's a collision and death. So moving DOWN isn't possible because it goes outside the grid. Therefore, from (2,0), moving DOWN is invalid.

So the first move options are LEFT or RIGHT because moving DOWN leads to death. Let me check:

If I choose LEFT, new head would be (1,0). Is that safe? The body cells after movement: After inserting old head at front, it becomes [(2,0), (2,1)]. Then, since not eating apple, the tail is removed. So BODY becomes [(2,0)].

Wait, but initially, the body is [(2,1)], so when moving LEFT:

new_head = (1,0). Check collision: new_head is inside grid. Is it in any body cells? The body after inserting old head would be [ (2,0), (2,1) ]. But before that, check if new_head is in the body except the tail's current position when that tail will move.

Wait, wait, step 2 of movement update: Check for collisions using state before body shifts. So before moving, the body is [(2,1)]. So new_head (1,0) is not part of any body cells because the body after head is at (2,1), which is different from (1,0). So no collision.

So after first move to LEFT: HEAD becomes (1,0), BODY is [ (2,0) ].

But wait, initial state after inserting old head would be [(2,0)] inserted at front, making the body [ (2,0), (2,1) ], then since not eating apple, tail is removed. So new body is [ (2,0) ].

Wait no: After moving, the steps are:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check collision with current body except possibly the tail's position after movement.
3. If safe:
   a. Insert old head to front of body.
   b. If ate apple, don't remove tail; else, remove tail.

So in this case, since new_head is (1,0), which is not part of the current body [(2,1)], so no collision.

After moving LEFT:

BODY becomes [ (2,0) ] because we inserted old head at front ([ (2,0), (2,1) ]) and then remove tail (since didn't eat apple). So new body is [ (2,0) ], which is a bit odd but allowed since the snake can have length 2 after moving.

Wait no: initial body is [(2,1)], so when we insert old head (which was at (2,0)), the new body before removing tail would be [ (2,0), (2,1) ]. Then, since not eating apple, remove tail. So final body is [ (2,0) ].

But wait, the initial body after inserting old head becomes [(2,0)] as front, and then append the current body elements?

Wait, no: The step says, insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list. So if the previous body was [(2,1)], inserting (2,0) at front makes it [ (2,0), (2,1) ]. Then, since not eating apple, remove last element (tail). So final body is [ (2,0) ].

Wait, but that can't be right because the head is now at (1,0), and the body is at (2,0). But that would mean the body is behind the head, which is allowed because it's adjacent. So the snake after first move would have head at (1,0) and body at (2,0).

But moving to (1,0) from (2,0), which is a LEFT move.

Alternatively, if I choose RIGHT as first move:

new_head = (3,0). Check collision: current body is [(2,1)], so new_head is not in body. So safe.

After movement:

Insert old head (2,0) at front of body: [ (2,0), (2,1) ]. Then remove tail because didn't eat apple, so body becomes [ (2,0) ].

So the snake would have head at (3,0) and body at (2,0). That's also allowed.

But moving RIGHT seems better because it moves towards the apple which is at higher x (7).

Wait, but from (2,0), to reach (7,7), I need to move right 5 times and up 7 times. But with the body in between, I have to plan a path that doesn't collide.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first? Wait, current direction is DOWN, so I can't choose UP next because it's reversing. So from DOWN, I can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN but which leads out of bounds.

So the initial move must be either LEFT or RIGHT.

If I choose RIGHT:

new_head = (3,0). Body becomes [ (2,0) ].

Then, on next moves, I can start moving up to get towards the apple.

But wait, from (3,0), if I change direction to UP, then each move would take me closer to the apple. But need to make sure that the body doesn't block the path.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to first move RIGHT until x=7, then move UP.

Wait, but let's think about the steps:

Current position: (2,0), direction DOWN, body [(2,1)].

First move options: LEFT or RIGHT.

Option 1: First move LEFT to (1,0). Then, next moves can be DOWN? But wait, from (1,0), moving DOWN would take it to (1,-1), which is invalid. So perhaps better to move UP after that.

Wait, but the direction after first move could change. For example:

First move: LEFT to (1,0).

Next, direction can be chosen as UP or any except reverse of current direction (which was LEFT; so next move cannot be RIGHT). Wait, no: The rule is you cannot reverse your previous direction. So if I moved LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT.

So after moving LEFT, next moves can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

Hmm, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps starting with moving RIGHT to (3,0) is better because it's moving towards the apple's x-coordinate.

Then, from (3,0), I can start moving UP.

But let's see:

First move: RIGHT → (3,0). Body becomes [(2,0)].

Second move: choose UP. New head at (3,1). Check collision with body [(2,0)]. Not in the same cell, so safe.

Body after inserting old head: [ (3,0), (2,0) ]. Then remove tail if not eating apple → body is [ (3,0) ].

But wait, the body would be [ (3,0), (2,0) ], then removing tail gives [ (3,0) ]? Or does the body after inserting head at front become [(3,0)] + current body?

Wait no: when moving from (2,0) to (3,0):

- Insert old head (2,0) to front of current body [(2,1)]. So new body becomes [ (2,0), (2,1) ].

But wait, initial body is [(2,1)], so inserting (2,0) at front makes it [ (2,0), (2,1) ]. Then, since we didn't eat apple, remove the last element → [ (2,0) ].

Wait no: step 3a says insert old head to front of body. So current body is [(2,1)], inserting (2,0) at front makes it [ (2,0), (2,1) ]. Then, since not eating apple, remove tail → [ (2,0) ].

So after first move to RIGHT:

head: (3,0)

body: [ (2,0) ]

Then next move can be UP. Let's do that.

Second move: UP from (3,0) → (3,1). Check collision with body [(2,0)]. No collision. So safe.

Body after inserting old head (3,0): [ (3,0), (2,0) ]. Then remove tail → [ (3,0) ].

So now, the snake is at (3,1) with body [(3,0)].

Third move: continue UP to (3,2). Body becomes [ (3,1), (3,0) ], then remove tail if no apple eaten. So after third move, body is [ (3,1) ].

But wait, this might not be efficient because each time the body is just the previous head position, which is moving up in a straight line.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move in a way that allows for turning later without getting stuck.

Wait, but I'm trying to reach (7,7), so maybe after reaching x=7, keep moving UP.

But let me think about how the body grows. Each time you make a move that doesn't eat apple, the body loses the last segment.

So each turn requires careful planning because the body can block your path.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to spiral or zig-zag towards the target.

Wait, but this could get complicated.

Another approach: Since the snake is currently at (2,0) with a single body cell below at (2,1), moving RIGHT increases x, which brings us closer to 7. Then, once x reaches 7, keep moving up.

But let's try that:

Move RIGHT to (3,0). Body becomes [(2,0)].

Next move: RIGHT again → (4,0). Body becomes [ (3,0) ].

Continue this way until x=7.

So moves:

1. RIGHT → (3,0)
2. RIGHT → (4,0)
3. RIGHT → (5,0)
4. RIGHT → (6,0)
5. RIGHT → (7,0)

Now at (7,0), with body segments: the last move would have body [(6,0)].

Then, change direction to UP and start moving up.

Each move UP will take head from (7,0) to (7,1), then (7,2), etc., until reaching (7,7).

But each time, we need to check for collisions with the body.

When moving up from (7,0):

new_head = (7,1). Body is [ (6,0), ... ]? Wait no: let's track body after each move.

Wait, after each RIGHT move:

Each time you move RIGHT, insert old head at front of current body, then remove tail if not eating apple.

So starting from (2,0):

Move 1: RIGHT to (3,0). Body becomes [ (2,0) ] after removing tail.

Move 2: RIGHT to (4,0). Insert old head (3,0), so body becomes [ (3,0), (2,0) ], then remove tail → [ (3,0) ].

Wait no: step-by-step:

After move 1:

- new_head = (3,0)

- check collision: no

- insert old head (2,0) to front of current body [(2,1)] → [ (2,0), (2,1) ]

- remove tail because didn't eat apple → body is [ (2,0) ]

After move 2:

- new_head = (4,0)

- check collision: current body is [ (2,0) ], so no collision.

- insert old head (3,0) to front of body → [ (3,0), (2,0) ]

- remove tail → body is [ (3,0) ]

After move 3:

- new_head = (5,0)

- check collision: current body [ (3,0) ].

- insert old head (4,0) to front → [ (4,0), (3,0) ]

- remove tail → body is [ (4,0) ]

After move 4:

- new_head = (6,0)

- check collision: current body [ (4,0) ]

- insert old head (5,0) → [ (5,0), (4,0) ]

- remove tail → body [ (5,0) ]

After move 5:

- new_head = (7,0)

- check collision: current body [ (5,0) ]

- insert old head (6,0) → [ (6,0), (5,0) ]

- remove tail → body [ (6,0) ]

So now, at (7,0), body is [ (6,0) ].

Now, we can start moving UP.

Move 6: UP to (7,1). Check collision with body [ (6,0) ] → no collision.

Insert old head (7,0) to front of body [ (6,0) ] → [ (7,0), (6,0) ]

Remove tail because didn't eat apple → body becomes [ (7,0) ]

Move 7: UP to (7,2). Check collision with body [ (7,0) ].

No collision. Insert old head (7,1) to front → [ (7,1), (7,0) ]. Remove tail → [ (7,1) ]

And continue this way until reaching (7,7).

But wait, each time we move UP, the body only keeps the previous head position. So after moving up once, the body is at (7,1). Moving up again would take it to (7,2), with body [ (7,1) ].

This seems manageable because each step only adds a new segment at the front and removes from the end, keeping the snake's path straight but moving upwards.

But wait, when we reach closer to y=7, the body segments might start overlapping if not careful. For example, after several UP moves, the body could be multiple segments, which might block the path.

Wait, actually, no: each time you move, you insert the old head at front and remove tail unless eating apple. So in this case, with each UP move, the body only has one segment behind the head because we didn't eat any apples yet.

So moving from (7,0) to (7,1), then (7,2), etc., would keep the body as a single segment behind, so no collision issues until much later.

But in this problem, the apple is at (7,7). So from (7,0), we need to make 7 UP moves. Each move will take us up one step.

So after moving UP seven times:

Move 6: (7,1)
Move 7: (7,2)
...
Move 13: (7,7)

At that point, the snake's head is at (7,7), and the body would be... Let's see:

Each move up adds a new segment at front and removes from tail. So after each UP move, the body is just the previous head position.

So when moving to (7,7), the body would be [ (7,6) ].

Therefore, there is no collision because the new_head (7,7) is not in the body except possibly the tail's next position, but since we're inserting and removing each time, it shouldn't collide.

Thus, the sequence of moves would be:

1. RIGHT to (3,0)
2. RIGHT to (4,0)
3. RIGHT to (5,0)
4. RIGHT to (6,0)
5. RIGHT to (7,0)
6. UP to (7,1)
7. UP to (7,2)
8. UP to (7,3)
9. UP to (7,4)
10. UP to (7,5)
11. UP to (7,6)
12. UP to (7,7)

But wait, after the first five moves (RIGHT four times: from 2→3→4→5→6→7), that's five moves? Wait no:

Wait initial position is move 0.

Move 1: RIGHT → x=3

Move 2: RIGHT →x=4

Move3: x=5

Move4:x=6

Move5:x=7

Then, six UP moves to reach y=7 (from 0→1→2→...→7). So total moves: 5 +7 =12.

But wait, initial position is (2,0). First move takes it to (3,0), that's move 1. Then four more RIGHT moves to get to x=7 at move 5.

Then seven UP moves (moves 6-12) take it to (7,7).

So total of 12 moves.

But is there a shorter path?

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a diagonal isn't possible because each move changes only one coordinate. So moving RIGHT and UP alternately could also work, but might require more moves or complicate the body path.

Another thought: Maybe growing the snake vertically first would allow for more flexibility, but considering we need to reach x=7, which is 5 units away from initial x=2, it's probably better to move horizontally first.

But let me think again about the body after moving RIGHT five times. The body segments are only at each previous head position, so no blocking occurs when moving up.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

1. RIGHT

2. RIGHT

3. RIGHT

4. RIGHT

5. RIGHT

6. UP

7. UP

8. UP

9. UP

10.UP

11.UP

12.UP

That's 12 moves in total.

But is there a shorter way? For example, moving diagonally isn't allowed since each move changes only one coordinate.

Alternatively, could we turn earlier to start moving up and also right at the same time, but that would require multiple turns which might complicate the body path.

I think 12 moves is necessary because you have to cover 5 units in x and 7 units in y. Since each move covers one unit, it's 12 moves total.

Thus, the answer is to make five consecutive RIGHT moves followed by seven UP moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to guide a snake from its starting position at (2,0) to reach the target position at (7,7). The snake can only move one unit in either the right or up direction each time. Additionally, after each move that does not result in eating an apple (which isn't required here), the snake's body loses the last segment.

### Approach
1. **Identify Target Coordinates**: The target is at (7,7). The snake starts at (2,0).
2. **Calculate Required Movements**:
   - To reach x=7 from x=2, we need 5 right moves.
   - To reach y=7 from y=0, we need 7 up moves.
3. **Plan the Path**: Since each move only affects one coordinate, we first move right to increase our x-coordinate and then move up to increase our y-coordinate.

### Solution Code
```python
# The sequence of moves to reach (7,7) from (2,0)
moves = ["RIGHT"] * 5 + ["UP"] * 7

print(moves)
```

### Explanation
1. **Right Moves**: We first make five "RIGHT" moves to increase our x-coordinate from 2 to 7.
2. **Up Moves**: After reaching x=7, we make seven "UP" moves to increase our y-coordinate from 0 to 7.

This approach ensures that the snake efficiently navigates to the target without unnecessary detours or complications due to body segments, as each move is straightforward and does not cause any collision issues.

RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 0) and whose body cells are in list format [(2, 1)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (7, 7). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
