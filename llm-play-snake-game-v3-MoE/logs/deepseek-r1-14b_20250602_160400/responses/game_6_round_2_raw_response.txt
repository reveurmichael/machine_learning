========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (5,8), and the apple is at (4,5). I need to find a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its own body or walls.

First, looking at the current state:
- Head: (5,8)
- Direction: "UP"
- Body: [(5,7)]
- Apple: (4,5)

The snake is moving upwards currently. The next move can't be down because that would reverse direction, which isn't allowed. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, UP.

Looking at the apple's position (4,5), it's to the left and below the head. To get there, the snake needs to move mostly left and down. But since the current direction is up, I need to plan a path that allows for that without causing collisions.

The body is currently [(5,7)], which is directly behind the head. If the snake moves LEFT from (5,8), it would go to (4,8). Then, the body would shift: the new head becomes (4,8), and the old head (5,8) becomes part of the body. So the body would be [(5,8)]. Since (4,8) is not occupied by any other body parts except maybe after moving, this seems safe.

Next steps might involve moving down towards the apple. But I have to make sure that each move doesn't lead the head into a collision with the body or walls. Also, after eating the apple, the snake grows, so there's no need to remove the tail, which means more space to maneuver but also a longer body to avoid.

I think moving LEFT first is safe. From (5,8), moving LEFT to (4,8). Then, perhaps move DOWN multiple times towards (4,5). But I have to check if the path is clear and that after each move, the head doesn't collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

Let me simulate a few moves:
1. Move LEFT: new_head = (4,8). Body becomes [(5,7), (5,8)]. Wait, no—the body is updated by inserting the old head at the front. So after moving LEFT, the body would be [ (5,8) ] because before, it was [(5,7)], and we add the old head (5,8). Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (which is now (5,7)), so the body becomes empty. So after first move, the snake's body is only the new head.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me re-examine the movement rules.

When moving normally:
- Insert old head at front of BODY.
- If not eating apple, remove tail.

So in this case, initial state: HEAD (5,8), BODY [(5,7)]. After moving LEFT to (4,8):
- New head is (4,8).
- Insert old head (5,8) into BODY: new BODY is [ (5,8) ].
- Then remove tail (since we didn't eat apple): body becomes empty.

So the snake's body after first move would be empty except for the head. So next moves can be more flexible.

So from (4,8), possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but not UP because it was moving LEFT and then cannot reverse immediately? Wait no—the current direction is now LEFT, so the next direction can't be RIGHT. But in this case, after moving LEFT, the direction becomes LEFT for the new head.

Wait, no: each move changes the direction based on the chosen direction. So when you choose a direction, it's set as the new direction regardless of previous direction, except for reversing which is not allowed.

Wait, the movement rules say that you can't reverse direction. So current direction is UP; next move cannot be DOWN. If I choose LEFT first, then the direction becomes LEFT, and the next move cannot be RIGHT.

But in this case, moving from (5,8) to (4,8) is LEFT, which is allowed because current direction is UP, so no reversal.

After that, direction is LEFT, so next moves can't be RIGHT.

So after first move, direction is LEFT. Next possible directions: DOWN, UP, but not LEFT again? Wait, no—directions are based on the previous movement. So if you moved LEFT, your current direction is now LEFT; you can't choose RIGHT next because that would reverse. Similarly for other directions.

Wait, let's clarify:

The current direction is "UP" initially. The first move must not be DOWN (since it's reversing). So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, UP.

If I choose LEFT as the first move, then the new direction becomes LEFT. Next move cannot be RIGHT.

So from (4,8), next possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or UP.

I think moving DOWN multiple times would help get closer to the apple at (4,5). So after the first LEFT, move DOWN three times: from (4,8) → (4,7) → (4,6) → (4,5).

Let's check each step:

1. Move LEFT to (4,8): safe as discussed.
2. Then, move DOWN to (4,7). The body after first move is empty except for head and new position. So moving DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7) would be fine because the body doesn't block it.
3. Next, move DOWN again to (4,6): same reasoning, no collision.
4. Then, move DOWN to (4,5), which is the apple.

But wait, when the head reaches (4,5), since that's the apple, we grow the snake. So after eating, the body won't be removed, so the snake becomes longer by one segment.

Also, I need to ensure that after eating, there's at least one legal move next turn. Since the apple is at (4,5), and the head is moving into it from (4,6), after eating, the direction is DOWN. The new body would be [ (4,8) ] plus the new head (4,5). Wait no—the movement rules state that when you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail.

Wait, let's think again about the movement after eating:

When new_head == apple:
- Insert old head into BODY.
- Do not remove the tail. So the body grows by one.

So initial state before eating: HEAD (4,6), BODY is empty because after first move, it was empty except for (5,8) but that's when we moved LEFT? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me retrace:

Initial state:
- Head: (5,8)
- Body: [(5,7)]
- Direction: UP

First move: LEFT to (4,8). The body is updated by inserting old head (5,8) into BODY, making it [ (5,8) ], and then removing the tail (since we didn't eat an apple), so body becomes empty.

So after first move:
- Head: (4,8)
- Body: []
- Direction: LEFT

Second move: DOWN to (4,7). Since body is empty except for head, it's safe. After moving, insert old head (4,8) into BODY. Then remove tail (empty), so body becomes [ (4,8) ].

Third move: DOWN to (4,6). Insert old head (4,7) into BODY. Body becomes [ (4,7) ] since we didn't eat apple and thus remove the tail (which was (4,8))?

Wait no: after moving from (4,7), inserting old head (4,7) into body, which was empty except for head (4,6). Wait I'm getting tangled here.

Let me clarify step by step:

Move 1:
- New head: (4,8)
- Body is updated by adding old head (5,8) to front → [ (5,8) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (which was (5,7)), so body becomes empty.
So after move 1: Head (4,8), Body empty.

Move 2:
- Direction can't be RIGHT because previous direction is LEFT. So possible directions: DOWN, UP, LEFT.
Assuming I choose DOWN to (4,7).
- New head: (4,7)
- Insert old head (4,8) into body → [ (4,8) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (which is empty), so body remains [ (4,8) ].

Wait no: after move 1, the body was empty. So in move 2:
- After inserting old head, body becomes [ (4,8) ], then since we didn't eat apple, we remove the tail. But if the body is now [ (4,8) ], removing the tail would leave it as an empty list again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body updates.

Let me refer back to movement rules:

3. Update body positions:
   a. Insert old head at front of BODY.
   b. If new_head == apple, grow: do not remove tail.
   c. Else, move normally: remove last element (tail).

So for each normal move (not eating apple), after inserting old head, you remove the last element.

In move 1:
- New head is (4,8)
- Insert old head (5,8) into body → [ (5,8) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail. But original body was [(5,7)], which after moving LEFT and inserting old head, becomes [ (5,8) ], then remove the last element (which is none because it's a single element?) Or wait, in move 1:

Wait initial body before move: [(5,7)]

After moving LEFT:
- Insert old head (5,8) into front → new BODY is [ (5,8), (5,7) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element (which is (5,7)), so final body after move 1 is [ (5,8) ]

So after move 1:
- Head: (4,8)
- Body: [ (5,8) ]
- Direction: LEFT

Then move 2: DOWN to (4,7)

- Insert old head (4,8) into front → new BODY is [ (4,8), (5,8) ]
- Remove last element (5,8) → final body after move 2: [ (4,8) ]

Move 3: DOWN to (4,6)

- Insert old head (4,7) into front → new BODY is [ (4,7), (4,8) ]
- Remove last element (4,8) → final body: [ (4,7) ]

Move 4: DOWN to (4,5) which is apple.

- New head: (4,5)
- Insert old head (4,6) into front → new BODY is [ (4,6), (4,7) ]
- Since new_head == apple, do not remove tail. So body becomes [ (4,6), (4,7) ] plus the inserted head?

Wait, no: after inserting old head (4,6) into front of existing body [ (4,7) ], it becomes [ (4,6), (4,7) ]. Then, since we ate apple, do not remove tail. So final body is [ (4,6), (4,7) ].

So after eating, the snake's body is [ (4,6), (4,7) ] plus the new head at (4,5). Wait no—the new head is (4,5), and the body includes all previous positions except for the tail being removed if not growing. But in this case, since we ate apple, we don't remove the tail, so the body becomes [ (4,6), (4,7) ].

So now, after eating, the snake's body is:

- Head: (4,5)
- Body: [ (4,6), (4,7) ]

And direction is DOWN. Now, next move can't be UP because previous direction was DOWN? No, wait—the direction was DOWN for this last move.

Wait no, each move changes the direction to whatever you choose, except reversing.

But since after eating, the snake's direction is DOWN, the next move cannot be UP (since that would reverse).

So from (4,5), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But moving further DOWN isn't necessary because we're already at the apple. So perhaps next move can be LEFT to (3,5), but let me check.

Wait no—after eating, we need to ensure there's a legal next move. The apple is at (4,5), so after eating, the snake is longer. But as long as it has space, it's fine.

But in this case, after moving from (4,6) to (4,5), the body is [ (4,6), (4,7) ], and head is (4,5). So no collision because those positions are separate.

I think moving LEFT first to get into a position where moving DOWN three times is safe works. So the path would be:

1. LEFT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN

Each move needs to be checked for collision with body after each step, but in this case, after the first move, the body is [ (5,8) ], which isn't in the way when moving down from (4,8). Then as we go down, the body shifts and doesn't block.

So I think this path should work: LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.
</think>

The snake can safely reach the apple by moving LEFT first to avoid immediate collision with its body, then proceeding downwards. The sequence of moves is:

1. Move LEFT to (4,8)
2. Move DOWN to (4,7)
3. Move DOWN to (4,6)
4. Move DOWN to (4,5) where the apple is located.

This path ensures that each move does not cause the head to collide with any part of the body except when eating the apple, at which point the snake grows and continues moving safely.

**Answer:**

The safe moves for the snake are LEFT, then three consecutive DOWNs. The sequence is:

\boxed{\text{LEFT}, \text{DOWN}, \text{DOWN}, \text{DOWN}}
