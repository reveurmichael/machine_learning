<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem where a snake is moving on a 10x10 grid. The goal is for the snake's head to reach an apple located at (8,5) without colliding with itself or getting trapped. Let me break down what I know and try to figure out a safe path.

First, let's summarize the initial state:

- **Head position**: (0,7)
- **Current direction**: LEFT
- **Body cells**: [(1,7)]
- **Apple position**: (8,5)

The snake is represented as a list where each element is adjacent to the next. The head is followed by its body segments up to the tail.

Now, I need to plan a series of moves that will guide the head from (0,7) to (8,5). Let's consider the movement rules:

1. **Direction Constraints**: The snake can't reverse direction on the first move unless it's "NONE". Since the initial direction is LEFT, the next directions must be RIGHT or "NONE".

2. **No Collisions**: The head cannot move into a cell occupied by any body segment except possibly when growing after eating the apple.

3. **Apple Eating Rule**: When moving towards the apple, if the snake eats it, it grows without losing its tail unless it's necessary to avoid collision in future moves.

4. **Path Planning Heuristic**: Use Manhattan distance but prioritize safety over the shortest path. The apple is 8 units right and 2 units down from the head. So ideally, moving RIGHT a lot and DOWN twice should work.

Let me think about possible initial moves:

Starting direction: LEFT. But that would take it away from the apple towards the top-left corner, which isn't ideal since we need to go right and down. So maybe after the first move, change direction.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, in the example provided, moving "LEFT" when starting at (0,7) leads the head to (-1,7), which is outside the grid—so that's invalid because the new head must stay within bounds. Therefore, the initial direction of LEFT would result in an immediate collision.

Wait a minute, no—the initial move isn't LEFT yet; the snake can choose any direction except RIGHT or UP/LEFT depending on constraints. Wait no: current direction is LEFT, but when moving, the next direction can be anything except if it's reversing (like from LEFT to RIGHT). But according to movement rules, you cannot reverse on the first move unless the current direction was "NONE". Since current direction is LEFT, the next direction must not be RIGHT.

Wait no—the problem says: "You are given one of 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT' or 'NONE' as the current direction." So in this case, it's LEFT. The movement update rule allows any direction except if you're reversing, but since your current direction is LEFT, next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT (same), or NONE.

Wait no: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So from LEFT, the next directions cannot be RIGHT. So possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN, or NONE.

But moving LEFT when at (0,7) would take it to (-1,7), which is invalid because x can't be negative. So that's not allowed. Therefore, the first move must be either UP, DOWN, NONE, but RIGHT is prohibited as per current direction being LEFT and cannot reverse on next move.

Wait no: The initial state's current direction is LEFT; when you choose a new direction for movement, you have to follow the movement rules which say that you can't reverse your last direction. So since your current direction was LEFT, your next direction must not be RIGHT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT (same), or NONE.

But moving LEFT from head at (0,7) would take it outside grid (x=-1). Thus, the first move cannot be LEFT because that leads to invalid position. Therefore, for the initial move, we have three options: UP, DOWN, or NONE (do nothing? But moving direction is required unless you choose NONE as a direction).

Wait no—the problem's movement example shows choosing "NONE" when current direction was LEFT allows not to move at all. So perhaps in this case, since the snake isn't moving now but can turn.

But for the initial step, after being told that the direction is LEFT, we need to choose a new direction without reversing it from LEFT on next steps.

Wait no: The problem's movement rules say that you cannot reverse your last move. So if current direction is LEFT, then the next move can't be RIGHT; but the first move could still be any direction except when considering reversals in subsequent moves.

But since we're at the very beginning, choosing a new direction for the first step shouldn't have any reversal constraints beyond what's allowed by the rules.

Wait no—the problem says: "You are given... current direction: LEFT. Your next move can’t reverse it—so if you turn LEFT to RIGHT is prohibited, but moving in another direction like UP or DOWN is allowed."

But perhaps since we're making a first step, and there's no previous step except being "NONE", so the initial movement doesn't have any reversal constraints.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine:

The problem states that you can move to any valid direction as long as it's not reversing from your current one unless if moving NONE is allowed.

But actually, in the movement update rule point 2: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, next cannot be DOWN; and vice versa. So for initial move, since the previous step was NONE (starting state), the first move can choose any direction except reversing from that previous. But if you were going LEFT last time, then your first move after that shouldn't be RIGHT.

Wait no: The problem says "if current direction is LEFT, next cannot choose RIGHT; similarly for other directions." So since the initial direction was LEFT, we can't choose RIGHT as our next move because it's a reverse. But wait, at this point, we're not changing direction yet—we're making the first move.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that when moving from (0,7) with current direction LEFT, what are the allowed directions for the first step?

The rules say:

- Current direction is LEFT; next cannot choose RIGHT.

So possible moves: UP, DOWN, NONE.

But let's check each move's validity:

1. Move UP: From (0,7), moving up would take us to (0,8). That's valid because 0 <= y=8 <10.
2. Move DOWN: From (0,7) down is (0,6).
3. Move NONE: The head stays at (0,7).

But we need the snake's head to move towards (8,5), so moving UP or DOWN may not be directly helpful because it would take us away from the target.

Wait wait, but our current position is (0,7). Our goal is (8,5), which is 8 units right and 2 units down. So ideally, we need to move mostly to the right and a little down.

But given that the first direction can't be RIGHT because of previous LEFT? Or no—wait: The initial direction was LEFT; when choosing the next step's direction, you cannot choose RIGHT if your current is LEFT. But perhaps in this case, since it's the first move after being LEFT, I'm allowed to choose another direction as long as it doesn't reverse.

Wait maybe that isn't correct because the movement example uses a different initial condition. Let me think again: The problem says "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So if your current direction was LEFT, then your next move cannot be RIGHT. But when starting, since there's no previous direction except NONE (as per initial state), perhaps the first move can go any way without being considered a reverse.

Wait that might make more sense because you haven't made a move yet; so reversing isn't an issue on the first step. So for example, moving LEFT again is allowed as it's same as current direction—so that doesn't count as reversing.

Thus, in this case, initial moves could be:

- UP
- DOWN
- LEFT (same)
- RIGHT

Wait no: The problem says you can’t reverse from the last move. So if your previous move was LEFT, next cannot be RIGHT; but same direction is okay. Since we start at LEFT and haven't made a move yet, perhaps moving LEFT again isn't considered a reversal.

But to clarify, according to point 2 in movement rules: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT↔RIGHT. So if the current direction was LEFT, your next cannot be RIGHT.

So, initial move from (0,7):

- Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (same as before). Because moving NONE would mean no movement—so we can avoid that unless necessary.

But I'm confused because in the first step, you have to choose a direction. So perhaps after starting at LEFT, next can be:

UP, DOWN, LEFT, but not RIGHT.

Given this, let's plan possible initial moves and see which could lead towards (8,5):

Moving UP would take us to (0,8), which is one cell up—this might help in the long run as we need more down movements. Moving DOWN takes us to (0,6), which is away from the target in terms of y-coordinate.

But our goal requires moving 8 cells right and 2 down. So perhaps the first move should be RIGHT if allowed. But since current direction is LEFT, can we choose RIGHT as next step? Wait no—because after being LEFT, you cannot reverse to RIGHT on the next move because they are opposites.

Wait according to point 2 in movement rules: "You may not choose a direction that would reverse your last move." So if current direction was LEFT, then next can't be RIGHT. Therefore, first step from (0,7) with current direction LEFT cannot be RIGHT; thus possible moves are UP, DOWN, or NONE.

But we need to make progress towards the target—so perhaps moving UP is a better initial step because it allows us more flexibility in y-axis movement.

Wait let's think: Starting at (0,7). If we move UP to (0,8), then our next directions can be any except DOWN if previous was RIGHT—but since previous was UP, next cannot choose DOWN. Wait no—this depends on the current direction each step.

Wait I'm getting too tangled up here. Let's try another approach: let's map out possible path options.

Option 1: Move UP first to (0,8).

Then from there, directions can't be DOWN (since previous was UP). So next moves could be LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

But our goal is moving right and down—so perhaps we should move RIGHT towards x=8. But each RIGHT step would take us closer in x but not directly helpful for y-axis.

Wait from (0,8), can we go RIGHT multiple times? Let's see:

Move RIGHT to (1,8). Then next moves cannot be LEFT because previous was RIGHT—so possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT again, or NONE. But moving right would take us towards the target, but y-coordinate is stuck at 8.

Then from there, we need to move down to reach y=5. So after several RIGHT steps, we can start moving DOWN. But with each step, if we turn RIGHT first and then DOWN, that's possible.

Alternatively:

Option 2: Move RIGHT once initially? Wait no—current direction is LEFT; next cannot be RIGHT as per point 2.

Wait but wait: The initial direction is LEFT because the current direction was set to LEFT. So when moving for the first time, can we choose a different direction than LEFT?

Yes—if possible directions are UP, DOWN, or NONE.

But moving LEFT again would mean same direction—so that's allowed.

Alternatively:

Option 3: After moving UP once, then move RIGHT twice and then start moving down—it might take longer but is feasible.

Wait I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the snake body after initial moves to avoid collision with itself.

Current snake head is at (0,7); body is [(1,7)]. So if we move up from head to (0,8), the body becomes [ (1,7), (0,8) ]—which seems okay because those cells are not occupied by other parts except for (1,7).

Wait no—the snake's body after moving should be added in front and tail removed. So when moving, the new head is at (new_x, new_y). The rest of the body follows.

So current body is [(1,7)]; if we move right to (1,8), then:

- New head: (1,8)
- Body becomes [ (2,8) ]—no collision with previous positions because prior was (1,7).

Wait no—the snake's body cells are the ones behind; so when moving from (0,7) to (1,8), the body is added at the front as (1,8); and since there were only [(1,7)], after moving right, the new head is (1,8) with body being [ (2,8) ].

So in that case, no collision occurs because (2,8) isn't occupied by any other part except possibly future moves.

But let's make a table of possible initial steps:

Option A: Move UP first from (0,7):

- New head position: (0,8)
- Body becomes [ (1,7), (0,8) ]
- Check if new head is valid: 0 <= x=0 <10; y=8. Valid.

Next direction cannot be DOWN because previous was UP.

So next steps can be LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

Let me choose to move RIGHT twice and then start moving down.

But first, from (0,8), if I move RIGHT once:

- New head: (1,8)
- Body becomes [ (2,8) ]

This is valid. Next direction cannot be LEFT because previous was RIGHT.

From (1,8), next can choose UP, DOWN, or NONE.

If we continue moving RIGHT to reach x=8—wait that's 7 steps from x=0 to x=8—but starting at (0,8), each RIGHT step increases x by 1. So after 8 steps, would be at (8,8). But our target is (8,5); so we need to move down as well.

So perhaps:

Move RIGHT once: head at (1,8)

Then move RIGHT again: (2,8)

Continue moving RIGHT until x=7? Then turn DOWN?

But that might take too many steps and could cause collision with the body if not careful.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to plan a path where we first move up to avoid going further right beyond certain points without turning down.

Wait this is getting complicated. Let me think about possible moves step by step:

1. Initial state: Head (0,7), Body [(1,7)], current direction LEFT.
2. Possible initial moves:
   - UP
   - DOWN
   - NONE

But moving NONE would mean no movement; since we need to move towards the target, better to choose another.

Let me try Option A:

Step 1: Move UP from (0,7) → (0,8)
Snake body becomes [(1,7), (0,8)]

Now at step 2: Current direction is LEFT. Next moves can't be RIGHT because previous was LEFT? Or since we moved UP first.

Wait no—current position after move up is (0,8); current direction wasn't changed yet; initial direction was LEFT.

So when moving for the first time, current direction was LEFT, so next move cannot choose RIGHT but can choose anything else: UP, DOWN, NONE, or same as before.

But in this case, we've moved to (0,8) which is different from initial position. Wait no—current direction after movement would be whatever you chose for the first step? Or does current direction change only on next steps?

No—the problem says "the head's movement is determined by direction." So perhaps when moving a new direction, that becomes the current direction.

Wait looking back at the example: starting with head (4,5), direction RIGHT. After moving right once, head is now (3,5), and direction changes to LEFT? Wait no—no, in the first part of the problem description, it's said:

"Your task is for the snake to move its head from a start position... with given initial conditions..."

So perhaps when you make a move, your current direction becomes that new movement.

Wait no—that might not be the case. The 'current direction' refers to the previous step or something else?

This is confusing because of unclear problem description on how directions change over steps.

Perhaps it's better to assume that each time we choose a direction for movement, that becomes our new current direction unless we're moving NONE—then current direction remains as last used. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps "current direction" refers to the previous step's direction. So after moving LEFT initially, next cannot move RIGHT; but if you first move UP or DOWN, then next can choose any except reversal of that.

But this is unclear.

Given the problem statement is ambiguous here, maybe it's best to make an initial assumption and proceed with it.

Assumption: The current direction refers to the previous step. So when moving from head position (0,7) in direction LEFT (initially), next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse.

But since we're making the first move after being LEFT, perhaps the current direction for movement is considered as such.

Wait it's getting too tangled without precise problem description on how directions change. Perhaps I should consider moving NONE initially and see if that helps.

Option B: Move NONE (don't move at all). But then you haven't moved towards the target—useless.

Therefore, perhaps Option A is better to start with.

But let me think differently: Maybe after some steps, turning around will help in avoiding collisions. So planning a path where we move up and right alternately might help prevent body collisions.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP then RIGHT multiple times until reaching x=8, then start moving DOWN towards y=5.

But without reversing direction (i.e., once I've moved LEFT initially, cannot move RIGHT next), so perhaps after moving Up first:

Step 1: Move UP to (0,8). Current direction now is UP.
Step 2: Can't move DOWN because previous was UP. So must choose LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE.

But if current direction was changed to UP, then next can't reverse it—so cannot move DOWN; but in this case, moving from (0,8), the target is at lower y=5. So perhaps after step 1:

Step 2: Move RIGHT once → head now at (1,8)
Step 3: Next direction can't be LEFT because previous was RIGHT.

But then we're stuck with moving either UP, DOWN, or NONE from there—since current direction is RIGHT.

Wait no—if I'm moving to the right and next step's movement cannot be LEFT. So possible steps are:

After (1,8):

- Step 3: Move RIGHT again → (2,8)
Step 4: Next can't move LEFT because previous was RIGHT

From there, same problem—no way to get down without reversing direction.

Thus, moving all right won't help us reach the target at y=5.

Therefore, perhaps I need to turn DOWN once after some steps.

But when?

Let me try:

Step 1: Move UP → (0,8)
Step 2: Move RIGHT → (1,8)

Now current direction is RIGHT. Next step can be UP, DOWN, or NONE.

If we move DOWN now—current position would be (1,7). But snake's body includes [(1,7)] as the second segment after moving right once? Wait no:

After Step 1: head at (0,8), body = [ (1,7), (0,8) ]

Step 2: move RIGHT → new head is (1,8); body becomes [ (2,8), (1,8), ... ]—Wait wait that's not correct.

No—the snake's body is always the previous segments. So when moving right from (0,7):

Wait initial head was at (0,7). Body: [(1,7)].

Moving RIGHT: new head is (1,7); body becomes [ (2,7), ... ]. No collision because prior to that it was only [(1,7)], so the new segment would be added in front.

Wait no—the way snake moves is each time you add your new head and remove the tail. So if initial state has head at (0,7) and body [(1,7)], then moving RIGHT takes head to (1,7), and body becomes [ (2,7) ]—because after moving, the next segments follow.

So in that case:

After Step 1: move UP → new head is (0,8); body = [ (1,7), (0,8) ]

Step 2: move RIGHT → new head is (1,8); body becomes [(2,8), (1,8)]

Wait no—that's not correct. The movement adds the new head to front and removes the tail.

So from initial:

Body: [A]

After moving RIGHT once—head at B=(current x+1, y). Body is added in front: so previous A becomes next segment, current head is now B.

Thus after Step 1: move UP → head (0,8), body = [ (1,7), (0,8) ]

Step 2: move RIGHT → new head is (1,8); body = [ (2,8), (1,8) ]—because previous segment was (1,7)—now it's the tail.

So after step 2: snake has two segments at [(2,8), (1,8)]—so no collision as head moved to (1,8).

Now Step 3: from (1,8), current direction is RIGHT. Next moves cannot be LEFT because previous was RIGHT.

Thus possible steps:

- Move UP → new head (1,9)—valid if y=9 <10
- Move DOWN → but this would take us to (1,7) which is the tail's position—causing collision.
- Move NONE: same as not moving

So only UP or NONE.

If we choose UP:

Step 3: move UP → head at (1,9), body becomes [ (2,8), (1,9) ]

Now Step 4: from (1,9). Current direction is UP. Next can't be DOWN because previous was UP.

Possible steps: LEFT, RIGHT, NONE

If we choose RIGHT:

Step 4: move RIGHT → head at (2,9); body becomes [ (3,9), (2,9) ]

But now from here, to get down to y=5 would require multiple steps moving DOWN—each time possible.

Wait but each step after that can't be LEFT because previous was RIGHT. So if we continue moving RIGHT:

Step 5: move RIGHT → (3,9)

Now Step 6: current direction is RIGHT; next can't be LEFT.

So only options are UP, DOWN, or NONE.

Moving DOWN would take us to (3,8). Is that safe?

Let me check:

Current head at (3,9); body after moving right once from previous step was [(4,9), (3,9)]—so new move to (3,8) is possible if it's not occupied by any other part.

But since the snake only has segments behind, as long as we don't have a segment at (3,8), which isn't present yet. So moving DOWN from (3,9) → (3,8). Body becomes [ (4,9), (3,8) ]

Now Step 7: current direction is DOWN.

But previous step was RIGHT; so next move can't be UP because that would reverse.

Wait no—if current movement was to RIGHT and then to DOWN—so last direction was DOWN. So now possible moves are LEFT, NONE, or same as before.

But in any case, moving down from (3,8) towards y=5 may take some steps without collision.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a path where after certain right moves, turning down is feasible.

This seems too time-consuming; maybe I should try to come up with an initial sequence that allows reaching target position.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the optimal path would be:

1. Move RIGHT 7 times from x=0 to x=7 at same y=7
2. Then move DOWN 3 times to reach y=4 (wait no, target is y=5; but starting y was 7)
Wait wait starting at y=7—moving down twice would get us to y=5.

But this may not be the case due to body collision.

Wait let's try:

Step 1: Move RIGHT → head (1,7); body [(2,7)]
Step 2: Move RIGHT → (2,7); body [(3,7), (2,7)]
...
After moving RIGHT 6 times from x=0→x=6; y remains at 7.

Now position is at (6,7). Body segments are [ (7,7), (6,7) ]—wait no:

Wait after each move right, the body is added in front. So initial snake has head at (0,7); body [(1,7)]

After moving RIGHT once: head is (1,7); body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7) ]

Moving RIGHT again: head (2,7); body becomes [ (3,7), (2,7) ]

So after 6 steps of RIGHT:

Step 7: Move right → x=6; body [(7,7), (6,7)]

Now position is at (6,7). Next direction can be UP, DOWN, or NONE.

If we move DOWN from here—head would go to (6,6). Check if that's safe. The current body after step 6 was [ (7,7), (6,7) ]. So moving down would place head at (6,6); which is not occupied by any other part except perhaps the tail.

Wait no—the tail was [(6,7)] before movement; so new position (6,6) is unique. Therefore:

Step 8: Move DOWN → head (6,6); body becomes [ (7,6), (6,6) ]

Now at step 9: current direction is DOWN; next moves cannot be UP because previous was DOWN.

Possible directions: LEFT, NONE, or RIGHT.

If we move RIGHT to x=7:

Step 9: Move RIGHT → head (7,6); body becomes [ (8,6), (7,6) ]

Now at step10: current direction is RIGHT; next moves can't be LEFT.

So options are UP, DOWN, or NONE.

Moving DOWN again from y=6 to y=5:

Step 10: Move DOWN → head (7,5); body becomes [ (8,5), (7,5) ]

Now at position (7,5). Next direction can't be UP because previous was DOWN.

But target is (8,5)—current x=7; so need to move RIGHT once more. But from here:

Step 11: Can we move RIGHT? Previous direction was RIGHT—so next move cannot be LEFT; but moving RIGHT again would make current direction RIGHT.

So step11: Move RIGHT → head at (8,5); body becomes [ (9,5), (8,5) ]

Now position is target! So total steps taken:

Starting from (0,7):

- 6 rights to get x=6
- 2 downs and one right to get to (6,6)
Wait no—the exact sequence was: after step6 at (6,7); move DOWN once → y=6; step8

Then Step9: Move RIGHT once→x=7.

Step10: Move DOWN twice? Wait in the previous steps:

Wait let's recount the moves:

Original plan after moving right 6 times to x=6:

Step7: Move right → (6,7) but body now [ (7,7), (6,7) ]

Then Step8: move down → (6,6); body [ (7,6), (6,6) ]

Step9: move right once→x=7; y remains 6. Body becomes [(8,6), (7,6)]

Step10: need to get closer to target at x=8.

But from here:

If we are at step10 with head at (7,6); can't move left because last was right.

So options: up/down or same.

We want to go down once more—current y is 6; moving down would be safe as body after movement is [(8,5), (7,5)]

Wait no:

At step10: head at (7,6); body [ (8,6), (7,6) ]

If we move down→y=5.

Is that position free? The snake's previous segments are only up to y=6—so moving from 6 to 5 would place the new head at (7,5). Since there is no segment at (7,5) yet, it's safe.

So step10: move down → (7,5); body becomes [ (8,5), (7,5) ]

Now, current direction was DOWN. Next move can't be UP.

We need to get to x=8; y remains 5—so we can move right once:

Step11: Move RIGHT→ head at (8,5); body becomes [(9,5), (8,5)]

So target achieved in step11.

Wait but did that cause any collision? Because when moving from (7,5) to (8,5), the new segment would be added before, so no overlap with prior segments except maybe the tail.

In this path:

Total steps: 6 RIGHTs + some moves = total of 11 steps?

But let's check whether during these movements, any step caused a collision.

At each movement, adding the new head and removing the last segment—so as long as the new head isn't overlapping with any previous segments except for the tail which is just removed, it should be safe.

Thus, in this case:

After initial 6 rights from x=0→x=6 at y=7: no collision because each step added a new rightmost segment without overlapping.

Then moving down once to (6,6): not occupied.

Move right again to (7,6): body is now [(8,6), (7,6)], which doesn't conflict with head's position (7,6).

Moving down from (7,6) to (7,5): body becomes [(8,5), (7,5)], safe as no prior segment at (7,5).

Finally moving right once—(8,5)—safe.

So seems this path works. But need to verify whether any step causes collision between segments or self-intersection.

Yes; each time you move forward, the new head is added in front of the body, so all previous segments are behind and do not interfere with new head except for when moving into an existing segment.

But as per our steps:

No new position ever overlapped with any prior segment except at the end—so this seems feasible.

Thus, the answer would be to move right 6 times, then down once, right once, down once, and finally right once more. But wait that's a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a shorter path where moving down earlier allows for less steps in total.

But according to our previous calculation, it takes 11 moves:

- 6 rights (steps7-12) → x=6
- move down once (step8)
- right once (step9→x=7,y=6)
- down once (step10→y=5,x=7)
- right once (step11→x=8,y=5)

Total 11 steps.

But perhaps this can be optimized by moving in a more diagonal-like fashion where we alternate directions to reach target quicker.

Wait but the snake moves only one segment at a time; thus, diagonal movement isn't possible except through turning which may cause overlap.

Alternatively, maybe using some other path that allows fewer steps.

Let me try another approach:

Start with initial position (0,7); body [(1,7)]

Move right → x=1,y=7; body [2→(2,7), 1→(1,7) ]

Then move down once → y=6; body [3→(2,6), 2→(1,6), etc.? Wait no—it's tricky to track.

Alternatively, perhaps a spiral-like path isn't useful here. Maybe the optimal way is moving straight right as much as possible then turning down towards target. But according to previous plan, that works.

Thus, after careful consideration, I think moving 7 rights would get us too far (x=6→7), but we need more precise steps.

But wait in our earlier path:

We moved from x=0→1→2→3→4→5→6 with 6 rights. Then down once to y=6; right again to x=7,y=6; down once to y=5;x=7; right once to reach target at (8,5).

Thus, this seems a feasible path.

Therefore, the final answer would be that it is possible for the snake to reach position (8,5) by first moving 6 times to the right, then once down, once right again, and finally one more step down—though in our detailed plan we had to do two downs. Wait no—the initial movement was:

After 6 rights at x=6,y=7; move down →x=6,y=6; move right→x=7,y=6; move down→x=7,y=5; then move right once.

So total steps: 11.

But according to the problem, we just need to determine if it's possible and maybe find a path. So perhaps yes, it is possible.

The snake can reach its target by first moving straight right seven times to position x=6, then down once, right again, and finally down one more time before reaching (8,5). This requires 11 steps without any collisions.

$\boxed{(8,5)}$

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(1, 7)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (8, 5). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
