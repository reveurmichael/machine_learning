========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
  "moves": ["DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Direct move DOWN to the apple at (5,4) is safe, as it is within grid bounds and does not collide with any body segments. After eating, legal moves (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) are available to avoid trapping."
