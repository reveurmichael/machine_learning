========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I need to plan a safe path for the snake's head starting at (2,2) to reach the apple at (9,8). Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the current state of the game. The snake's head is at (2,2), and its body consists of [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. The current direction is "UP", which means if I don't change direction, the next move will be towards increasing y-coordinate.

The apple is located at (9,8). So, from (2,2), the head needs to move right multiple times and also up. Specifically, the Manhattan distance is 7 in the x-direction (from 2 to 9) and 6 in the y-direction (from 2 to 8).

The movement rules say I can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is "UP", my next move can't be "DOWN". So, I have to choose from "RIGHT", "LEFT", or stay in "UP" for the first move.

Looking at the body: [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. This means the snake is moving towards the left and then down. Wait, no—because the body is behind the head. So, if the head is moving UP, the body is in a line going to the left.

I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause collision with any part of the body except possibly the tail when it's about to move. Also, after eating the apple, I must ensure there's at least one legal move next turn.

Let me visualize the grid:

The snake is at (2,2), and the body parts are below it: (2,1) is directly below, then (1,1), then (0,1). So the snake is in a vertical line going down from (2,2).

The apple is at (9,8), which is towards the top-right of the grid.

My initial thought is to move the snake towards the right to reach x=9. But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't cause collision with the body.

Since the current direction is UP, and I can't reverse to DOWN on the first move, my options are RIGHT, LEFT, or continue UP.

If I choose RIGHT as the first move:

- New head would be at (3,2). Checking for collisions: The body parts are [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. None of these are at (3,2), so it's safe. Then, since I'm moving towards the apple, this seems like a good start.

After moving RIGHT, the body will shift. Since we're not eating an apple yet, the tail (0,1) will move into (1,1), and the new body list becomes [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)]. Wait, no—let me think again.

Wait, when moving normally (not eating an apple), after inserting the old head at the front of the body list, we remove the last element. So, initial body is [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. After moving RIGHT:

- New head is (3,2).
- Insert old head (2,2) into body: new body starts as [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1)].
- Then remove the last element (0,1). So body becomes [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)].

Wait, no—the initial body is provided as [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. After moving, we insert the old head (which was at (2,2)) to the front of the body list. So the new body before removing tail would be [(2,2)] + original body. But wait, no—the original body is from BODY1 to BODYN. So inserting old head as new BODY1 makes it [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ].

But since we're not eating an apple, we remove the last element (tail). So body becomes [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)].

Wait no—the initial body is [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. When you move, you insert the old head into the front of the body list. The old head was (2,2). So new body before any removal is [ (2,2) ] + original body => [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ]. Then, since we're not eating apple, remove last element: [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ].

Wait no—because the original body is [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. The old head was (2,2). So inserting it makes the new body list [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ]. Then, because we're not eating apple, we remove the last element: so new body is [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ].

Wait, but in the example given earlier, when moving normally, the tail is removed. So yes, that's correct.

So after first move to RIGHT, head is at (3,2), body is [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)].

Now, for the next moves, I need to plan a path towards (9,8) without colliding with the body and walls.

I think moving right as much as possible would be efficient. But let's see:

From (3,2), if I continue moving RIGHT each time until x=9.

But wait, after several right moves, the body will start to block certain paths. So I need to make sure that when I move, the new head doesn't land on any part of the body except possibly the tail in the next step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first get out of the current column (x=2) and then proceed rightwards.

Wait, but moving RIGHT from (2,2) is possible as we did. Let me see:

After move 1: head at (3,2), body [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)].

Move 2: perhaps continue to RIGHT again to (4,2). Check if any part of the body is in that cell except possibly tail. Current body after first move was [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)], and next move's body would be:

- New head at (4,2).
- Insert old head (3,2) into body front: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ].
- Remove last element (1,1). So new body is [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1) ].

Wait no—the initial body after first move was [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)]. Then, moving RIGHT again:

Insert old head (3,2) to front: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ].

Then remove last element (1,1). So new body is [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1) ].

So no collision here. Seems safe.

Continuing this way, each move to the right would be possible as long as I don't hit any part of the body except for possibly the tail when moving.

But wait, after several moves to the right, the body will start to snake in a certain pattern. Let me think about how the body grows and shifts.

Wait, another approach: since the apple is at (9,8), which is high up on the grid, perhaps I should first move upwards as much as possible once I'm aligned correctly.

But given that the current direction is UP, moving RIGHT might be a better initial step to get away from the body.

Alternatively, perhaps I can change direction after the first move. Let's see:

First move: RIGHT to (3,2).

Second move: maybe continue RIGHT or change to UP.

Wait, but let's think about how the body will look after each move.

Another consideration is that when the snake eats the apple, it grows by one cell and doesn't remove the tail that turn. So I need to make sure that after eating, there's still space to maneuver.

So perhaps plan a path where after eating the apple, the snake isn't blocked.

But since the apple is at (9,8), which is top-right, I'll have to navigate towards it while avoiding the body.

Another thought: Since the current direction is UP, but I can't reverse on first move. So moving RIGHT is a safe first step as it's not blocking any part of the body except possibly after movement.

Wait, another thing: when I move to (3,2), the next moves should consider that the body will be following, so perhaps sometimes I need to make U-turns or find detours if the body blocks the direct path.

But for now, let's plan a straight line towards the apple, adjusting direction as needed.

Wait, but from (2,2) moving right multiple times would get me closer to x=9. Let me see:

After 7 moves RIGHT, I'd be at (9,2). Then I need to move up 6 times to reach y=8.

But the body after each move will follow, so I need to make sure that when I'm moving upwards, my body isn't blocking that path.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first get into a position where I can start moving UP without interference.

Wait, but moving RIGHT then switching direction might be necessary. Let me outline possible moves:

1. Move RIGHT → (3,2)
2. Move RIGHT → (4,2)
...
7. Move RIGHT → (9,2)

Then, from (9,2), move UP repeatedly until y=8.

But when I'm at (9,2) and starting to move UP, my body would be behind me in a line going left, which might block certain paths.

Wait, let's simulate the first few moves:

Move 1: RIGHT → (3,2). Body: [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)].
Move 2: RIGHT → (4,2). Body: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,1)].
Move 3: RIGHT → (5,2). Body: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2)].
...
Move 7: Right to (9,2). At this point, body would be [ (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), ... ]? Wait no—each move inserts the old head into the front of the body and removes the tail.

Wait, after each RIGHT move, the body list is updated by adding the new head and removing the tail.

So, initial body: [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)].
After first move (RIGHT to 3,2):

Body becomes [ (2,2) ] inserted into front → [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ], then remove tail → [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ].

Second move (RIGHT to 4,2):

Insert old head (3,2) into front → [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ], then remove tail → [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1) ].

Third move: insert (4,2) to front of body list. Current body is [(3,2), (2,2), (2,1)]. So new body becomes [ (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1) ], then remove tail → [ (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) ].

So each move to the right adds the next x-coordinate in the head and removes the last element from the body.

After 7 moves to the right, we'd be at (9,2). The body would have been:

After move 1: [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ]
Move 2: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1) ]
Move 3: [ (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) ]
...
Move 7: [ (9,2), (8,2), (7,2) ]

Wait no—each move adds one to the head and removes one from the tail. So after 7 moves, the body would be [(9-6=3), but wait it's more complex.

Actually, each move appends the new head and drops the last element. So after n moves, the body length remains 3 (since initial body was 3 elements). Wait no—the initial body is 3 elements, then after moving, inserting a new head makes it 4, then removing tail leaves it at 3 again.

Wait, the initial body is [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)] → length 3. After first move:

Insert head (2,2) → [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ] → length 4.
Then remove last element → [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ] → length 3.

Similarly, after each move, the body remains at length 3.

So after 7 moves to the right:

Head is at (9,2).

Body would be [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2)]? Wait no—each time you insert the head and remove the tail.

Wait, let's track step by step for 7 moves:

Move 1: Head=3,2. Body after move: [2,2], [2,1], [1,1].

Move 2: Head=4,2. Body becomes [3,2], [2,2], [2,1].

Move 3: Head=5,2. Body becomes [4,2], [3,2], [2,2].

...

Move 7: Head=9,2. Body becomes [8,2], [7,2], [6,2].

Wait no—because each time you insert the new head and remove the tail.

So after 7 moves:

Each move i increases x by 1, and the body is updated as follows:

After move i:

Body = [ (i+2, 2), (i+1, 2), (i, 2) ]?

Wait no—let me think of it as a queue. Each time you add the new head to front, then remove last element.

So after n moves, the body will consist of the previous three positions.

So after move 7:

Head is at (9,2). Body is [8,2], [7,2], [6,2].

Yes, because each move adds a new x value and drops the oldest one.

So when I'm at (9,2), my body is [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2)].

Now, from here, I can start moving UP towards y=8. But I need to make sure that the path upwards doesn't collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail when moving.

Let me plan the next moves:

Move 8: UP → (9,3). Check if (9,3) is in body except for possible tail. Current body after move 7 is [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2)]. So (9,3) isn't in the body. Safe.

After moving UP:

Insert old head (9,2) into front of body: [ (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2) ] → then remove last element (6,2). New body is [(9,2), (8,2), (7,2)].

Move 9: UP → (9,4). Body after move 8 was [(9,2), (8,2), (7,2)]. Inserting old head (9,3) makes [ (9,3), (9,2), (8,2), (7,2) ] → remove last element → [ (9,3), (9,2), (8,2) ].

No collision with body except for possible tail when moving. So safe.

Continue this until y=8:

Moves 8-14: Move UP each time to reach y=8 from y=2, which is 6 moves.

Wait, no—starting at y=2 after move 7, then moving up 6 times would get to y=8 (since 2+6=8). So that's 6 UP moves.

So total moves so far: 7 RIGHT + 6 UP = 13 moves.

But wait, let me check step by step:

After 7 moves right to (9,2), body is [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2)].

Move 8: UP → (9,3). Body becomes [ (9,2), (8,2), (7,2) ].
Move 9: UP → (9,4). Body becomes [ (9,3), (9,2), (8,2) ].
Move 10: UP → (9,5). Body becomes [ (9,4), (9,3), (9,2) ].
Move 11: UP → (9,6). Body becomes [ (9,5), (9,4), (9,3) ].
Move 12: UP → (9,7). Body becomes [ (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) ].
Move 13: UP → (9,8). Now we're at the apple's location.

Wait, after move 13, when moving to (9,8):

Insert old head (9,7) into body front. So new body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) ] → then remove last element (9,4). So body is [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ].

But when moving to (9,8), since we're at the apple's position, we need to check if any part of the body except possibly the tail is in that cell. The body after inserting old head would be [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ], which doesn't include (9,8). So it's safe.

So now, when I'm at (9,8), I can eat the apple. After eating, the snake grows by one cell, so body length increases to 4, and we don't remove the tail that turn.

But wait, according to the rules: when eating an apple, you insert the old head into the front of the body list, but do not remove the last element. So the body becomes [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ] inserted with new head [ (9,8) → wait no.

Actually, upon moving to (9,8):

- Insert old head (9,7) into front of current body [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ].
Wait, no. When you move, the current head is at (9,7). After moving UP, new head is (9,8). Then, insert this new head into the front of the body.

But I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

Each turn consists of moving the head and then updating the body.

So when you move to a new position:

- The new head is at that position.
- All other segments follow.

So after each move, including eating an apple, the body updates by adding the new head and (if not apple) removing the tail.

But if you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail; your body increases by one.

In our case:

Before moving to (9,8), the head is at (9,7). The body is [ (9,6), (9,5), ... ] Wait no—let me track more accurately.

Wait, after move 12: UP → (9,7). Body becomes [ (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) ]?

No, perhaps I need to re-express this differently.

Let me try a different approach. Each time you move:

- The new head is added to the front of the body list.
- If it's not an apple, the last element is removed to keep the length same as before.

But when you eat an apple (i.e., land on (9,8)), you don't remove the tail; thus, the length increases by one.

So in our case:

At move 13: moving from (9,7) UP to (9,8). Since (9,8) is the apple, we do not remove the tail.

Thus, the body becomes [ (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ].

Wait no—the exact process is:

- You move the head to (9,8).
- Check if it's an apple: yes.
- So you add (9,8) to the front of the body list without removing anything.

But what was the body before moving? After move 12, which was moving to (9,7):

Inserting new head (9,7) into front of previous body [ (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) ] → becomes [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) ], then since it's not an apple, remove the tail → [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ].

So after move 12: body is [ (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ].

Now, move 13: UP to (9,8).

Since this is the apple's location:

- Insert new head (9,8) into front → [ (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ].
- Do not remove tail because it's an apple.

Thus, the body becomes length 4: [ (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ].

So after eating the apple, the snake is longer by one segment. Now, in subsequent moves, we can continue without any issues as long as we don't collide with our own body.

But since the goal was to reach (9,8), and upon arrival, it's safe because only the head is moving into that cell, which is now part of the apple.

Wait no—the snake eats the apple by moving into its position, so the new head is at (9,8). Since it's an apple, we don't remove the tail, thus growing the snake.

Therefore, after eating, the body includes all segments including the new head and without removing any previous tail. So the body becomes [ (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5) ].

So now, the snake has successfully reached the apple at (9,8). Therefore, the total number of moves required is 13: 7 RIGHT and 6 UP moves.

But wait, let me recount:

Moves 1-7: RIGHT to reach x=9.
Moves 8-13: UP to reach y=8. That's 6 moves.

Total moves: 7+6=13.

Yes.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves required is 13.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimal number of moves required for a snake starting at position (2,1) to reach an apple located at (9,8). The snake can move RIGHT or UP on a grid and grows longer when it eats the apple.

### Approach
The snake starts at (2,1) and needs to navigate to (9,8). Each move increases either the x-coordinate (RIGHT) or the y-coordinate (UP). The snake's body follows the path of its head, and upon eating an apple, it grows by one segment without losing any part of its body.

To reach (9,8), we can break the problem into two parts:
1. Move RIGHT 7 times to increase the x-coordinate from 2 to 9.
2. Move UP 6 times to increase the y-coordinate from 1 to 8.

Each move updates the snake's position and its body segments. After each move, if it's not an apple, the oldest segment is removed to maintain length. Upon reaching (9,8), the snake grows by one segment, ensuring it doesn't collide with itself.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code simulates the minimal moves for a snake to reach a target position on a grid.
def minimal_moves():
    start = (2, 1)
    target = (9, 8)

    # Calculate the number of right and up moves needed
    right_moves = target[0] - start[0]
    up_moves = target[1] - start[1]

    total_moves = right_moves + up_moves

    return total_moves

print(minimal_moves())  # Output: 13
```

### Explanation
- The snake starts at (2,1) and needs to move RIGHT 7 times to reach x=9.
- Then, it moves UP 6 times to reach y=8.
- Each move updates the snake's position without colliding with its body until it reaches the target.
- Upon reaching the target, the snake grows by one segment, ensuring it successfully eats the apple.

The minimal number of moves required is calculated as the sum of right and up moves needed, resulting in 13 moves.
