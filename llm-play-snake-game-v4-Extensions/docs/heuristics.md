## üß≠ Common Heuristics for Snake Game

### 1. **Greedy Heuristics**

Choose the move that brings the snake **closest to the apple**.

* **Manhattan Distance Heuristic**

  $$
  h(x, y) = |x - x_{apple}| + |y - y_{apple}|
  $$

  * Fast and simple.
  * Fails when path is blocked by the body.

* **Euclidean Distance (less common in grid games)**

  $$
  h(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - x_{apple})^2 + (y - y_{apple})^2}
  $$

  * Smooth but not optimal for grid-based movement.

‚úÖ **Pros**: Simple, efficient
‚ùå **Cons**: Short-sighted ‚Äî can trap the snake in tight spaces.

### 2. **Safety-First Heuristics**

Prioritize **survival** over score.

* **Flood Fill Heuristic (Space Availability)**
  Estimate how much free space a move leads to using BFS/DFS. Choose the move that leads to **largest available region**.

* **Longest Path Heuristic**
  Try to follow the longest path to the apple to delay reaching it ‚Äî keeps tail far from head and prevents self-collision.

* **Tail-Aware Heuristic**
  Ensure that the snake **can reach its own tail** after taking a step (i.e., simulate that the tail will vacate that cell).

‚úÖ Pros: Excellent survival behavior
‚ùå Cons: Slower, more complex to compute

---

### 3. **Lookahead-Based Heuristics**

Use **limited-depth simulations** to evaluate future consequences.

* **Minimax with Heuristics**
  Evaluate next `N` steps and pick the one with best final outcome score.

* **Monte Carlo Rollouts**
  Play random simulations from current move and choose the move that leads to most survivable runs.

* **A*-like Search*\*
  Use `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` where:

  * `g(n)` is path cost so far
  * `h(n)` is estimated distance to apple
    Use flood-fill to ensure solution path exists.

‚úÖ Pros: Smarter behavior
‚ùå Cons: Slower than greedy

---

### 4. **Rule-Based / Priority Heuristics**

Use manually designed logic:

```python
if apple in line_of_sight and path is safe:
    go to apple
else:
    follow wall
```

Variants:

* Always go clockwise
* Always turn left if path is blocked
* Stick to the perimeter when near full capacity

‚úÖ Good for baselines
‚ùå Brittle and hard to scale

---

### 5. **Cycle-Based Heuristics**

Use a **precomputed Hamiltonian Cycle** or simple loop around the grid.

* Guarantees survival by following cycle
* Optional: add shortcut logic when safe

‚úÖ Theoretically infinite survival
‚ùå Poor apple efficiency unless optimized

---

### 6. **Potential Field Heuristics**

Assign a **potential value to each cell**:

* Positive near apple
* Negative near walls/snake body
* Snake moves toward gradient

Like electromagnetism or heat maps.

‚úÖ Smooth control
‚ùå Prone to local minima (can get stuck)

---

## üß† Hybrid Heuristics

You can also **combine** the above ideas. For example:

```python
score = -manhattan_distance + 2 * flood_fill_area - 5 * danger_risk
```

Or use:

* **Greedy path to apple if it‚Äôs safe**, otherwise
* **Flood fill to choose largest region**
