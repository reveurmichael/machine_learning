========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem where a snake is on a 10x10 grid and needs to reach an apple. The snake's current position is at (7,7), facing up. There's no body because the body cells list is empty. So effectively, the snake is just its head right now.

First, I need to plan how the snake can move towards the apple located at (2,8). Since there's no body blocking, this should be relatively straightforward, but I have to consider direction changes and avoid self-collisions.

The snake can't reverse direction on the first move. So if it starts moving left or right, up or down, it can only continue in that direction unless blocked by a wall or its own body later on. But since there's no body yet, for now, any initial direction should be possible except maybe directly into the apple.

The goal is to get from (7,7) to (2,8). Let's calculate the required moves:

- In x-direction: 7 - 2 = 5 steps left.
- In y-direction: 8 - 7 = 1 step up.

So, I need a combination of moves that results in moving left five times and up once. However, since each move is one step at a time, the snake can't jump multiple cells at once. So the order might matter because after certain directions, reversing or changing could cause collisions.

Since direction changes are allowed except for immediate reversals (like UP followed by DOWN), I need to make sure that the path doesn't get blocked. But since there's no body yet, any initial move should be safe as long as it doesn't immediately reverse.

Let me think about a path:

1. Start facing up. Move up once: new head at (7,8). Now position is closer in y but not enough x.
2. Then, continue moving left each time until reaching x=2.

Wait, after the first move up to (7,8), then moving left five times would get from x=7 to 2, and y stays at 8. But that's more than needed because y is already correct but we need to go one step back? Wait no—the apple is at (2,8). So after moving up once to (7,8), the snake needs to move left five times: from x=7 down to 2.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

From (7,7) to (2,8):
- Move up one step to (7,8).
- Then move left five steps to reach x=2.

But in terms of directions:
- UP once.
- Then LEFT five times.

However, the snake's body is only the head at this point. So moving left each time won't cause a collision because there are no body segments blocking.

Wait, but after each move left, the head moves to (6,8), then (5,8), etc., until (2,8). Each of these steps doesn't collide with any previous positions except the starting point. Since it's just the head moving, and no body yet, this should be safe.

But wait, when you move left five times from (7,8) to reach (2,8), that’s a total of 5 moves: UP followed by LEFT x4? Wait:

No, initial position is (7,7). First move up to (7,8): now y increases by 1. Then each move left decreases x by 1.

So the sequence would be:
UP → (7,8)
LEFT → (6,8)
LEFT → (5,8)
LEFT → (4,8)
LEFT → (3,8)
LEFT → (2,8)

But that's six moves: one UP and five LEFTs. However, in terms of direction changes, moving up then left multiple times is allowed as long as you don't reverse.

Wait, but the first move is UP, so after that, moving LEFT is fine because it's not a reversal (UP followed by LEFT isn't reversing). So this path should be valid.

Let me check each step:

1. Move UP from (7,7) to (7,8).
2. Then five times MOVE LEFT:
   - (6,8)
   - (5,8)
   - (4,8)
   - (3,8)
   - (2,8)

Each of these moves is legal because the snake's body is only at the head and doesn't occupy any other cells yet. After each move left, the new head position is checked against the previous positions except for when it would cause a collision in the next step.

But wait, after moving up to (7,8), the body list is empty, so no issues with collisions from body segments.

Each subsequent move left will only change x by 1 each time without overlapping any previous head positions because they are all on the same y-coordinate and different x-values. So this should be safe.

Therefore, the moves would be:
UP, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT

But wait, let me count: from (7,7) to (2,8):

- UP takes us closer in y.
- Then five LEFTs to decrease x by 5 each time.

Total directions: [ "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT" ]

Wait, but the apple is at (2,8), which is directly left from (7,7) if we first move up. So moving up and then all lefts would get us there without any issues.

Yes, that seems to be a valid path with six moves.

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Move UP first to increase y-coordinate towards the apple. Then move LEFT five times to decrease x-coordinate from 7 to 2, reaching (2,8) safely without any collisions or reversals."
}
```
```

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 7) and whose body cells are in list format [(7, 6)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (2, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
