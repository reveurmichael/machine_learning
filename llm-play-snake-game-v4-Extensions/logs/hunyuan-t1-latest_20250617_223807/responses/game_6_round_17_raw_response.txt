========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": [],
"reasoning": "The snake's head is at (3,0) with a long body occupying positions from (3,1) up to (3,5), right to (7,5), down to (7,6), left to (2,6), and down to (2,5). The apple is at (7,8), requiring 4 RIGHT and 8 UP moves. However, the body blocks critical paths: moving UP from (3,0) is blocked by (3,1)-(3,5); moving RIGHT to (7,0) and UP is blocked by (7,5)-(7,6) in the body. The body's structure creates a barrier between the head and apple, making a safe path impossible."
