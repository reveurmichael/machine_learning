========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (7,1) to eat the apple at (2,7). The current direction is "DOWN", and the body cells are [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,7)]. 

First, I need to understand the snake's current position. The head is at (7,1). Since the direction is "DOWN", that means from the previous move, it was moving down. So looking at the body cells, the next segment after the head is (7,2), which makes sense because moving down from 1 would go to 2 in y-coordinate.

Wait, but wait—down actually decreases the y-coordinate. Wait no, according to the coordinate system, "DOWN" means y-1. So if the snake is moving down, from a higher y to lower y. But looking at the body cells: after (7,1) comes (7,2), which is up. That seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check the coordinate system. The bottom-left is (0,0), top-right is (9,9). So moving "UP" increases y by 1, and "DOWN" decreases it. So if the head is at (7,1) and direction is "DOWN", then the next cell after that would be (7,0). But according to the body cells, the first cell is (7,2), which is higher in y than the head. That doesn't make sense because moving down from (7,1) should take it to (7,0).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again: The snake's direction is "DOWN", so the next move would be towards lower y-values. But according to the body cells, after the head at (7,1), the next cell is (7,2). That suggests that the snake was moving up, not down. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait no, the direction is "DOWN", so from the previous state, the snake moved down. Therefore, the body cells after the head should be along the path of the movement. If the head is at (7,1), and it was moving down, the next cell would be (7,0). But in the given body cells, it's (7,2), which is up. That doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body cells are ordered. The body cells list starts from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the snake is moving down, the next cell after the head would be one step in that direction, but according to the body cells, it's (7,2), which suggests that the movement was up.

Wait, perhaps the current direction is "DOWN", meaning that the next move will be in that direction. So the head is at (7,1), and when moving down, the new head would be (7,0). But looking at the body cells, it's currently [(7,2), ...], which suggests that the snake has moved up before.

Hmm, perhaps I should visualize this. The head is at (7,1). The direction is "DOWN", so next move will take it to (7,0). The body cells after that are [(7,2), (7,3), etc.] So the snake's body extends upwards from the head towards (7,7) and then turns right to (8,7). 

So the snake's current path is a vertical line up from (7,1) to (7,7), then a turn to the right at (8,7). Now, the apple is at (2,7), which is on the same y-level as the top of the snake. So it's somewhere to the left.

I need to plan a path for the head to move from (7,1) to (2,7). Let me calculate the Manhattan distance: |7-2| =5 in x-direction and |1-7|=6 in y-direction. Since the movement requires 5 LEFT moves and 6 UP moves.

But I have to make sure that each move doesn't cause collision with the body or go out of bounds.

First, current direction is "DOWN". So if the next move is not a reverse direction (since you can't reverse), so from "DOWN", I can choose any direction except "UP".

Wait no, according to the movement rules: You cannot reverse. If current direction is "DOWN", next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again? Or wait, no—can't reverse, which would be switching between UP and DOWN or LEFT and RIGHT.

So from "DOWN", I can choose any direction except "UP". So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But the apple is at (2,7), so to get there, moving LEFT towards x=2 is necessary. But with current head at (7,1), I need to figure out a safe path considering the body and apple's position.

Let me see: if I choose "LEFT" as the first move from "DOWN", that would take the head to (6,1). Then check for collisions—does this new head collide with any body cells except possibly the tail?

The current body is [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,7)]. The new head would be at (6,1). So checking if (6,1) is in any of these cells—no. Also, it's within grid bounds.

So first move: LEFT to (6,1).

After that, the body will shift. Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail moves as well. The new head is (6,1), and the body becomes [(7,1)] + previous body except last? Wait no—the process is:

- Insert old head at front of BODY list.

So after moving LEFT, the new head is (6,1). Then, insert old head (7,1) into BODY, making it [ (7,1), (7,2), ... , (8,7) ].

But then, since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail (8,7). So new body cells are [(7,1), (7,2), ..., (7,6)].

So now the snake is [ (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) ].

Next move: Let's choose "LEFT" again to (5,1). Check collisions. New head at (5,1). Is that in the body? Body is [(7,1)...], no collision. So safe.

After moving LEFT, new body becomes [ (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), ..., (7,5) ]—since tail was (7,6) and we remove it if not growing.

Wait no—the previous step after first move: the body is [(7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)].

Then moving LEFT again to (5,1). Insert old head (6,1) into body, making it [ (6,1), (7,1), ... , (7,6) ]. Then remove tail (7,6), so new body is [ (6,1), (7,1), ..., (7,5) ].

So the snake's head is now at (5,1). Next move: again LEFT to 4,1. Check collisions—no, because body starts at 6,1.

Continuing this way, moving LEFT until x=2. So after five LEFT moves, we would reach (2,1), but that seems too far. Wait, the apple is at (2,7). Hmm, perhaps I need to go up as well.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's better to move up first to get closer in y-direction before moving left. But from current position (7,1), which is down near the bottom, and apple is at (2,7) which is upper left.

So the Manhattan distance is 5 in x and 6 in y. Since we can't go straight because of body, perhaps a combination of LEFT and UP moves.

Alternatively, maybe first move up as much as possible to reduce the y-distance.

Wait but from current direction "DOWN", next moves cannot be "UP" if it's a reverse? Wait no, from DOWN, you can choose any except UP—no, wait: movement rules say you cannot reverse. So from DOWN, you can't switch to UP because that would be reversing direction. Or wait, the current direction is DOWN; so when choosing next move, "UP" is not allowed. Because it's a reversal.

Wait, according to rule 2: You may not choose the opposite direction. If current direction is "DOWN", then you cannot choose "UP". So after moving in a certain direction, you can't reverse immediately.

So first move from DOWN can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

If I choose LEFT as the next move (to 6,1), which seems safe. Then, for the next moves, since current direction is now LEFT, so the next moves cannot be RIGHT.

Wait no: after moving LEFT, the new direction is "LEFT", so next move can't be RIGHT.

So perhaps plan a series of LEFT and then UP moves.

But let's see:

1. Move LEFT to (6,1). Direction becomes LEFT.
2. Next move can't be RIGHT; must choose LEFT or DOWN or UP? Wait no—after moving LEFT, the direction is now LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about how the direction changes. Each time you make a move, that's your new direction.

So first move: from "DOWN", we moved LEFT, so new direction is LEFT.

Next move must not be RIGHT, but can be LEFT again or any other except opposite.

But wait, no—reverse only applies to UP/DOWN and LEFT/RIGHT. So if you're moving in a certain axis (x or y), you can't reverse along that axis.

So from LEFT, you cannot choose RIGHT next. But can choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first move LEFT as much as possible without conflict and then switch to moving UP once clear.

But given the body is extending upwards from (7,1) to (7,7), which is on x=7, y=7. So moving left towards x=2 would require crossing from 7 down to 2 in x while avoiding body cells.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to move up first as much as possible.

But from current head at (7,1) direction DOWN—wait no, after the first move, we can change directions.

Wait, perhaps moving UP next. Let me think: After moving LEFT to (6,1), then moving UP would take us towards x=6, y=2 and so on.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to find a path that goes around the body.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the best first move is LEFT, as initially thought.

So:

Move 1: LEFT from (7,1) to (6,1). Direction becomes LEFT.

Check for collision: new head at (6,1), which isn't in body cells [(7,2)...], so safe.

Body becomes [ (7,1), (7,2), ..., (7,5), (7,6) ] after inserting old head and removing tail if no apple eaten. Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed, making the body now [ (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) ].

Move 2: From (6,1), direction is LEFT, so next move can be LEFT again or UP/DOWN, but not RIGHT.

If I choose LEFT to (5,1). Check collision—no, as body starts at 6,1. So safe.

Body becomes [ (5,1), (6,1), ..., (7,4) ] after inserting old head and removing tail.

Continue this way until x=2:

Move 3: LEFT to (4,1)

Move 4: LEFT to (3,1)

Move 5: LEFT to (2,1)

At this point, the head is at (2,1). Now, need to move up from y=1 to y=7.

But moving UP from here would require checking for collisions with body cells. The current body after these moves is:

After each LEFT move, the body extends leftwards and shortens on the right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to switch direction earlier.

Alternatively, maybe move UP once at (2,1) to check if safe.

But let me see: After five LEFT moves, the head is at (2,1). The body would now be [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1) ] assuming each move adds to the front and removes from the tail.

Wait no: Each time you move LEFT, the new head is inserted at front of body list. So after first move: [ (7,1), ...], but in reality, it's more complex because the initial body cells are given as [(7,2)...].

Wait perhaps I'm making a mistake in tracking the body.

Let me try to simulate:

Initial state:
Head: (7,1)
Direction: DOWN
Body cells: [ (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,7) ]

Move 1: LEFT to (6,1). Direction becomes LEFT.

Insert old head (7,1) into body list:

New body cells before removing tail: [ (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), ..., (7,7), (8,7) ]

But since we didn't eat an apple, remove the last cell (8,7). So new body is [ (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) ].

So snake's cells: head at (6,1), body at (7,1), (7,2)...(7,6).

Move 2: LEFT to (5,1). Direction now LEFT.

Insert old head (6,1) into body:

Body becomes [ (6,1), (7,1), ..., (7,5) ] after removing tail (7,6).

So snake's cells: (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2)...(7,5).

Move 3: LEFT to (4,1). Direction LEFT.

Body becomes [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3) ] after removing tail (7,4).

Wait no—each time you move, you insert the old head into the body list and remove the last cell if not growing.

So after each LEFT move:

Move 1: Inserted (7,1), removed (8,7). Body is [ (7,1), (7,2)...(7,6) ].

Move 2: Inserted (6,1), removed (7,6). Body becomes [ (6,1), (7,1), ..., (7,5) ].

Move 3: Inserted (5,1), removed (7,5). Body is [ (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4) ].

And so on. So after five LEFT moves, the head would be at (2,1). The body cells would be:

After each move, inserting new head and removing tail. Let's track step by step:

Move 1:
Head: (6,1)
Body: [ (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) ]

Move 2:
Head: (5,1)
Body: [ (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) ]

Move 3:
Head: (4,1)
Body: [ (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4) ]

Move 4:
Head: (3,1)
Body: [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3) ]

Move 5:
Head: (2,1)
Body: [ (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2) ]

Now, the head is at (2,1). Next move needs to be in a direction other than RIGHT (since current direction is LEFT; can't reverse).

Options: UP or DOWN. Since apple is at (2,7), moving UP would make sense.

Move 6: UP from (2,1) to (2,2). Check collision: new head is (2,2). Body cells are [ (3,1), ... ], so no collision.

After moving UP:

Insert old head (2,1) into body. New body before tail removal: [ (2,1), (3,1), ..., (7,2) ]

Remove last cell if not growing. Since we didn't eat an apple, remove the last cell, which is (7,2). So new body is [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1) ].

Wait no—since after move 5, the body was [ (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2) ]. After moving UP, insert (2,1) at front: [ (2,1), (3,1), ..., (7,2) ] and remove last cell, which is (7,2). So new body is [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1) ].

So head is now at (2,2).

Continue moving UP:

Move 7: UP to (2,3). Check collision with body cells. Body after move 6 is [ (2,1), ...], so new head (2,3) is safe.

After inserting old head (2,2), the body becomes [ (2,2), (2,1), ..., (6,1), (7,1) ] before removing tail. Remove last cell (7,1). New body: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ].

Head is at (2,3).

Move 8: UP to (2,4). Check collision—safe.

Body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) ] after inserting and removing tail (6,1).

Head at (2,4).

Move 9: UP to (2,5). Safe.

Body becomes [ (2,4), (2,3), ..., (4,1) ] etc.

Move 10: UP to (2,6). Safe.

Move 11: UP to (2,7). Now, head is at (2,7).

Check if this position allows for the apple to be eaten. Wait—the apple is presumably at (2,7)? Or where? The problem statement didn't specify, but in any case, moving up from (2,6) to (2,7) would reach the apple.

But we need to ensure that when the head reaches (2,7), it doesn't collide with its own body. After move 10, the head is at (2,6), and the body extends behind.

So after moving UP from (2,6):

Insert old head (2,6) into body list: [ (2,6), (2,5), ..., (3,1) ] etc.

Wait, but this might cause the head to be at (2,7), which is outside any potential collision as long as the path was clear.

But I think that moving LEFT five times and then UP six times would reach (2,7). However, need to ensure that each move doesn't step into body cells.

In this simulation, all moves were safe because we moved away from the original body which was on x=7 and y increasing.

Thus, the path is:

1. Move LEFT five times to get to x=2.
2. Then move UP six times to reach y=7.

Total of 11 moves.

But wait—each time you make a move, you can't step into your own body. So in this case, when moving from (2,1) upwards, the path is clear because the body was left behind on x>=3 and y<=1.

Therefore, the minimal number of steps to reach (2,7) without colliding with itself would be 5 LEFT and 6 UP moves, totaling 11 moves.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to a target position while avoiding collisions with its own body. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move changes the direction of the snake, and it cannot reverse direction along the same axis consecutively.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake starts at position (7,1) and needs to reach a target position. In this case, we assume the target is at (2,7). The snake's body extends behind it as it moves forward, so each new move must avoid colliding with its own body.

2. **Intuition**: To efficiently navigate around the body of the snake, we can first move left to create space and then move up to reach the target. This approach ensures that the snake avoids its body by moving away from it initially.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Move left five times to position (2,1).
   - Then move up six times to reach (2,7).
   - Each move must check for collision with the snake's body to ensure safety.

### Solution Code
```python
# Simulate snake movement to reach target without self-collision

def simulate_snake_movement():
    # Initial position of head and body
    head = (7, 1)
    direction = 'DOWN'  # initial direction as per problem setup
    body = [(7 + i, 1) for i in range(1, 7)]  # assuming the body follows from (7,2) to (8,7)

    moves = []
    target = (2, 7)
    
    # Simulate moving left five times
    for _ in range(5):
        if direction == 'LEFT':
            new_head = (head[0] - 1, head[1])
        else:
            new_head = (head[0] - 1, head[1])  # move left regardless of previous direction
        # Check collision with body before moving
        if new_head in body:
            print("Collision detected while moving left.")
            break
        moves.append(('LEFT', new_head))
        # Update head and body
        body.insert(0, new_head)
        body.pop()  # remove the last part of the body
        head = new_head
        direction = 'LEFT'  # update direction

    # Now move up to reach target (2,7)
    current_y = head[1]
    while current_y < target[1]:
        new_head = (head[0], current_y + 1)
        if new_head in body:
            print("Collision detected while moving up.")
            break
        moves.append(('UP', new_head))
        # Update head and body
        body.insert(0, new_head)
        body.pop()
        head = new_head
        direction = 'UP'
        current_y += 1

    if head == target:
        print(f"Successfully reached {target} in {len(moves)} moves.")
    else:
        print("Failed to reach the target.")

simulate_snake_movement()
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at (7,1) with its body extending from (7,2) to (8,7).
- **Moving Left**: We move left five times to get to (2,1). Each move checks for collision with the body and updates the head position.
- **Moving Up**: After reaching (2,1), we then move up six times to reach the target at (2,7). Again, each move checks for collisions.
- **Collision Detection**: The simulation includes checks to ensure the snake does not collide with its own body during movement.

This approach ensures that the snake navigates efficiently to the target without self-collision by first moving away from its body and then proceeding towards the target.
