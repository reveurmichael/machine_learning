<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out a safe path for the snake to eat the apple at (4,1) without causing any collisions. The snake's head is currently at (9,5), and it's moving right. The body is just one segment behind at (8,5). 

First, let me visualize the grid. The head is near the top-right corner, and the apple is somewhere in the middle-left area. Since the snake is length 2 (head plus one body), it can move around without too much obstruction, but I need to plan carefully.

The initial direction is RIGHT, so the first move cannot be LEFT because that's reversing direction. But wait, no—since the current direction is RIGHT, according to the rules, I can't choose LEFT next. So my options for the first move are UP, DOWN, or continue moving RIGHT.

Looking at the head position (9,5), if I go RIGHT again, it would take me out of bounds because x=10 is beyond the grid. So RIGHT isn't an option on the first move. That leaves me with UP and DOWN as possible moves.

If I choose to go UP from (9,5) to (9,6), that's within bounds. Then I can proceed towards the apple. But wait, moving UP might not be the most efficient path since the apple is lower in y-coordinate (it's at y=1). Alternatively, going DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4) brings me closer to the apple's y-coordinate.

Wait, but let me think about this more carefully. The apple is at (4,1), which is much lower and to the left. So I need a path that moves the head from (9,5) all the way to (4,1). Since x needs to decrease by 5 units (from 9 to 4), the snake will need to move LEFT multiple times. Y needs to decrease by 4 units (from 5 to 1), so moving DOWN four times.

But I can't just go straight LEFT and DOWN because the body might block the path, especially after eating the apple when the body grows longer.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. From (9,5) move DOWN to (9,4). Now the head is at (9,4), body is [(8,5), (9,5)] but wait, no—the initial body is only [(8,5)], so after moving, the body becomes [(9,5), (8,5)]. Wait, no—when you move, the old head is added to the body. So first move:

- Move DOWN: new_head = (9,4). The body was [ (8,5) ], now insert (9,5) at front, so body becomes [(9,5), (8,5)]. Since we didn't eat an apple, remove tail (8,5), so body is just [(9,5)]. Wait no—if the snake's body was only one segment, moving down would make the new head (9,4), and the old head (9,5) becomes part of the body. So after the first move, body is [ (9,5) ].

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct this:

Initial state: Head at (9,5), direction RIGHT, body [(8,5)].

First move options:

- Can't go RIGHT because it's out of bounds.
- Choose to go DOWN first.

So new_head is (9,4). Now check for collisions: The body is [(8,5)], which doesn't interfere with (9,4), so safe. Then, insert old head (9,5) into the body list, making it [ (9,5), (8,5) ]. Since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail (8,5). So after this move, the new body is just [(9,5)]. Head is now at (9,4).

Next, I can choose to go LEFT. But wait, direction was DOWN; next move cannot be UP. So from DOWN, I can't reverse. Wait, no—current direction is DOWN now? Or does the initial direction stay as RIGHT?

Wait, no: each move changes the direction based on what you choose. In the first step, the current direction is RIGHT, but after moving DOWN, the new direction becomes DOWN for next moves.

Wait, let's clarify movement rules:

When you make a move, your new direction is whatever you choose, as long as it doesn't reverse. So if current direction is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT. But in this case, on the first move, since we're moving from RIGHT to DOWN (which isn't reversing), that's allowed.

So after the first move, direction is DOWN. Now, for the second move, I can choose any except UP, because current direction is DOWN and you can't reverse.

But wait, according to rule 2: Cannot reverse—so if current direction is "DOWN", next cannot be "UP". So yes, correct.

So after moving DOWN to (9,4), I have the head at (9,4), direction DOWN. Next moves can't be UP. Hmm, but that might not help because the apple is below y=1, so we need to move DOWN more.

Wait, no: y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving DOWN decreases y. From (9,5), moving DOWN takes y from 5 to 4, which is towards lower y values. But the apple is at (4,1), which has a much lower y.

Wait, maybe I should move in the opposite direction for y—like going UP first? No, because that would take me away from the apple's y-coordinate. Wait, no: moving DOWN decreases y, so to get from 5 to 1, we need four DOWN moves.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to go LEFT as much as possible while ensuring the path doesn't collide with the body.

Wait, let's think about the movement steps:

Current position: head at (9,5), direction RIGHT. Body [(8,5)].

First move: can't go RIGHT because it's out of bounds. So options are UP or DOWN.

If I choose to go DOWN first:

1. Move DOWN: new_head (9,4). Body becomes [ (9,5) ] after removing tail. Direction is now DOWN.
2. Next, can't go UP. So next move options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.
   - Moving RIGHT again would take us back towards (10,4), which is invalid.
   - So choose LEFT: new_head (8,4). Check if this collides with body? Body after first move is [(9,5)]. No collision. Then insert old head (9,4) into body, making it [ (9,4), (9,5) ], then remove tail (9,5) because not eating apple. So body becomes [(9,4)].
3. Now direction is LEFT.

Next move: from (8,4). Can't go RIGHT now because current direction is LEFT. So options are DOWN or UP.

Wait, but moving further down isn't helpful; perhaps it's better to start moving towards the apple.

Alternatively, maybe the initial moves should be a series of LEFTs and then DOWNs.

Let me try another approach:

Move 1: DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4). Direction is now DOWN. Body after move: [(9,5)].

Move 2: LEFT from (9,4) to (8,4). Now direction is LEFT. Body becomes [ (9,4), (9,5) ] but then remove tail (9,5), so body is [ (9,4) ].

Wait, no—when moving LEFT, the new head is (8,4). Insert old head (9,4) into body list, making it [ (9,4), ... ]? Wait, initial body after move 1 was [ (9,5) ]? No: initial body after first move was [ (9,5) ] because we added the old head and then removed the tail.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-express:

After each move, the body is updated by adding the previous head to the front and possibly removing the tail if not growing.

So:

Initial state:
- Head: (9,5)
- Direction: RIGHT
- Body: [ (8,5) ]

Move 1: Choose DOWN.
- new_head = (9,4).
- Check collision: body is [(8,5)] which doesn't conflict with (9,4). Safe.
- Insert old head (9,5) into body list → new body list becomes [ (9,5), (8,5) ].
- Since not eating apple, remove tail → body becomes [ (9,5) ].
- So after move 1:
   - Head: (9,4)
   - Direction: DOWN
   - Body: [ (9,5) ]

Move 2: Choose LEFT (since direction is DOWN; can't choose UP).
- new_head = (8,4).
- Check collision: body is [(9,5)], which doesn't interfere with (8,4). Safe.
- Insert old head (9,4) into body → [ (9,4), (9,5) ].
- Remove tail (9,5) since not eating apple. Body becomes [ (9,4) ].

Now, state after move 2:
- Head: (8,4)
- Direction: LEFT
- Body: [ (9,4) ]

Move 3: Next direction is LEFT, so can't choose RIGHT.
   - Options: UP or DOWN or continue LEFT.

If we go LEFT again:
   new_head = (7,4). Check collision with body [(9,4)]? No. Safe.
   Insert (8,4) into body → [ (8,4), (9,4) ]. Remove tail (9,4) → body is [ (8,4) ].

But moving further LEFT might take us away from the apple's x position of 4. So perhaps it's better to switch direction after a few LEFT moves.

Alternatively, maybe move DOWN again now that we're at (8,4). Let me see:

Wait, current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT. But can choose UP or DOWN.

If I choose DOWN from (8,4), new_head is (8,3).

Check collision: body after move 2 was [ (9,4) ], which doesn't interfere with (8,3). Safe.
Insert old head (8,4) into body → [ (8,4), (9,4) ]. Remove tail (9,4) → body is [ (8,4) ].

Now head at (8,3), direction DOWN.

But then I can continue moving DOWN to reach lower y.

Alternatively, perhaps a better strategy is to move in a spiral or some pattern that allows the snake to get closer to the apple while avoiding self-collision.

Wait, but given the snake's initial length and the need to move 5 LEFTs and 4 DOWNs, maybe it's best to plan a path that weaves through without crossing itself.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a grid and see how the snake moves:

Start at (9,5). Need to reach (4,1).

Let me outline a possible path step by step:

Move 1: DOWN from (9,5) → (9,4). Body becomes [ (9,5) ].
Move 2: LEFT from (9,4) → (8,4). Body becomes [ (9,4) ].
Move 3: LEFT → (7,4). Body [ (8,4) ].
Move 4: LEFT → (6,4). Body [ (7,4) ].
Move 5: LEFT → (5,4). Body [ (6,4) ].
Move 6: LEFT → (4,4). Now at x=4, but y=4. Apple is at (4,1), so need to move DOWN three more times.

But moving from (4,4):

Move 7: DOWN → (4,3). Check if body [ (5,4) ] interferes? No.
Move 8: DOWN → (4,2).
Move 9: DOWN → (4,1). Now at apple position. But wait, in this case, when the head reaches (4,1), it would eat the apple and grow longer.

But let's check each step for collisions:

After move 6: body is [ (5,4) ] because after each LEFT move, we add the previous head to the front and remove the tail. So:

Move 6:
- Head: (4,4)
- Body before move: [ (6,4) ]
- Insert old head (5,4) → body becomes [ (5,4), (6,4) ]
- Remove tail (6,4) → body is [ (5,4) ]

Move 7: DOWN from (4,4) to (4,3).
   - Check collision with body [(5,4)]. No.
   - Insert old head (4,4) into body → [ (4,4), (5,4) ]
   - Remove tail (5,4). Body becomes [ (4,4) ]

Move 8: DOWN from (4,3) to (4,2).
   - Body is [ (4,4) ], no collision.
   - Insert old head → body [ (4,3), (4,4) ]
   - Remove tail. Body becomes [ (4,3) ]

Move 9: DOWN from (4,2) to (4,1). Now at apple position.

But wait, when the snake's head reaches (4,1), which is where the apple is, does it eat the apple and grow? Yes.

After eating the apple, the body doesn't remove the tail because we grew. So:

Move 9:
   - Head: (4,1)
   - Body before move: [ (4,3) ]
   - Insert old head (4,2) → body becomes [ (4,2), (4,3) ]
   - Since eating apple, don't remove tail. So body is now [ (4,2), (4,3) ].

Now, the snake's length has increased to 4 (head + 3 segments). Next moves will need to be careful not to collide with the body.

But wait, I'm assuming that after each move except when eating an apple, we remove the tail. But in this case, since we ate the apple, the body doesn't shrink; it grows by one.

So, from move 9, body is [ (4,2), (4,3) ] and head is at (4,1).

Next, I need to continue moving towards the apple's position, but actually, the apple is already eaten. So perhaps after that, the snake can continue in any direction, but needs to avoid self-collision.

But since the problem only asks for a series of moves leading up to eating the apple, maybe it's sufficient to outline up to move 9.

Wait, but let me count the number of moves:

Move 1: DOWN → (9,4)
Move 2: LEFT → (8,4)
Move 3: LEFT → (7,4)
Move 4: LEFT → (6,4)
Move 5: LEFT → (5,4)
Move 6: LEFT → (4,4)
Move 7: DOWN → (4,3)
Move 8: DOWN → (4,2)
Move 9: DOWN → (4,1) [apple eaten]

That's a total of 9 moves. Let me check for any potential collisions in these steps.

In each move, when we insert the previous head into the body and then remove the tail unless eating apple:

After Move 6:
- Head at (4,4)
- Body: [ (5,4) ]
No collision.

Move 7: DOWN to (4,3). Body becomes [ (4,4), (5,4) ] → but after removing tail, body is [ (4,4) ]

Wait, no—after move 7:

- Insert old head (4,4) into body → [ (4,4), (5,4) ]
- Remove tail (5,4). So body is [ (4,4) ]

Move 8: DOWN to (4,2). Insert (4,3) into body → [ (4,3), (4,4) ]. Remove tail (4,4). Body becomes [ (4,3) ].

Move 9: DOWN to (4,1). Insert (4,2) into body → [ (4,2), (4,3) ]. Don't remove tail since we ate apple. So body is now two segments: [(4,2), (4,3)] and head at (4,1).

This seems safe as none of the moves caused collision with existing body.

But wait, when moving from (9,5) to (9,4), then LEFT to (8,4), etc., we need to ensure that in each move, the new head doesn't collide with any part of the current body before inserting the old head.

For example:

Move 2: HEAD at (8,4). Current body after move1 was [ (9,5) ]. So (8,4) is not colliding with (9,5), safe.

Move3: HEAD at (7,4). Body is [ (8,5) ]? Wait no—after move2:

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in tracking the body after each move. Let me redo this step by step with precise updates:

Initial State:
- Head: (9,5)
- Direction: RIGHT
- Body: [ (8,5) ]

Move 1: DOWN → new_head = (9,4)
   - Check collision: body is [(8,5)], no collision.
   - Insert old head (9,5) into body → [ (9,5), (8,5) ]
   - Remove tail since not eating apple → body becomes [ (9,5) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (9,4)
   - Direction: DOWN
   - Body: [ (9,5) ]

Move 2: LEFT → new_head = (8,4)
   - Check collision with body [(9,5)]? No.
   - Insert old head (9,4) into body → [ (9,4), (9,5) ]
   - Remove tail (9,5) since not eating apple. Body becomes [ (9,4) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (8,4)
   - Direction: LEFT
   - Body: [ (9,4) ]

Move 3: LEFT → new_head = (7,4)
   - Check collision with body [(9,4)]? No.
   - Insert old head (8,4) into body → [ (8,4), (9,4) ]
   - Remove tail (9,4). Body becomes [ (8,4) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (7,4)
   - Direction: LEFT
   - Body: [ (8,4) ]

Move 4: LEFT → new_head = (6,4)
   - Check collision with [(8,4)]? No.
   - Insert old head (7,4). Body becomes [ (7,4), (8,4) ]
   - Remove tail (8,4). Body is [ (7,4) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (6,4)
   - Direction: LEFT
   - Body: [ (7,4) ]

Move 5: LEFT → new_head = (5,4)
   - Check collision with [(7,4)]? No.
   - Insert old head (6,4). Body becomes [ (6,4), (7,4) ]
   - Remove tail. Body is [ (6,4) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (5,4)
   - Direction: LEFT
   - Body: [ (6,4) ]

Move 6: LEFT → new_head = (4,4)
   - Check collision with [(6,4)]? No.
   - Insert old head (5,4). Body becomes [ (5,4), (6,4) ]
   - Remove tail. Body is [ (5,4) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (4,4)
   - Direction: LEFT
   - Body: [ (5,4) ]

Move 7: DOWN → new_head = (4,3)
   - Check collision with [(5,4)]? No.
   - Insert old head (4,4). Body becomes [ (4,4), (5,4) ]
   - Remove tail. Body is [ (4,4) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (4,3)
   - Direction: DOWN
   - Body: [ (4,4) ]

Move 8: DOWN → new_head = (4,2)
   - Check collision with [(4,4)]? No.
   - Insert old head (4,3). Body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ]
   - Remove tail. Body is [ (4,3) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (4,2)
   - Direction: DOWN
   - Body: [ (4,3) ]

Move 9: DOWN → new_head = (4,1)
   - Check collision with [(4,3)]? No.
   - Insert old head (4,2). Body becomes [ (4,2), (4,3) ]
   - Since we ate the apple, do not remove tail. So body is now [ (4,2), (4,3) ]
- New State:
   - Head: (4,1)
   - Direction: DOWN
   - Body: [ (4,2), (4,3) ]

So in this path, after 9 moves, the snake's head reaches the apple at (4,1). The body segments are [(4,2), (4,3)], and the head is at (4,1). No collisions occurred during any of these moves.

Therefore, the sequence of moves required is:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. LEFT
6. LEFT
7. DOWN
8. DOWN
9. DOWN

But let's map each move in terms of direction changes. The initial direction after the first move (DOWN) affects subsequent moves.

Wait, no—the directions are chosen step by step. So from (9,5), first move is DOWN to (9,4). Then turn LEFT and proceed.

So, the actual sequence of turns would be:

From (9,5):

1. Move DOWN to (9,4)
2. Turn LEFT and move to (8,4)
3. Continue moving LEFT (same direction) to (7,4)
4. Continue LEFT to (6,4)
5. Continue LEFT to (5,4)
6. Continue LEFT to (4,4)
7. Turn DOWN and move to (4,3)
8. Continue DOWN to (4,2)
9. Continue DOWN to (4,1)

So the turns are: initial direction RIGHT becomes DOWN after first move, then LEFT for several steps, then DOWN again.

But in terms of movement commands, if we're assuming that each move can be in one of four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), and the snake can change direction at each step, then the sequence would involve changing directions as needed.

Alternatively, if we need to specify a fixed path without considering the snake's current direction, perhaps we can outline it as a series of moves:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT (from the new position)
3. LEFT again (same direction)
4. LEFT again
5. LEFT again
6. LEFT again
7. DOWN
8. DOWN
9. DOWN

But actually, after moving DOWN once, the snake is facing DOWN, then turns LEFT and continues in that direction for several steps, then turns DOWN again.

Alternatively, to model it as a list of directions from the starting point:

1. DOWN (to 9,4)
2. LEFT (to 8,4)
3. LEFT (7,4)
4. LEFT (6,4)
5. LEFT (5,4)
6. LEFT (4,4)
7. DOWN (4,3)
8. DOWN (4,2)
9. DOWN (4,1)

So the directions taken are: DOWN, then five LEFTs, then three DOWNs.

But in reality, after each move, the snake's direction changes based on the movement command.

Wait, but the initial direction is RIGHT. So first move is DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), which is a 90-degree turn to face DOWN. Then next moves are all LEFT turns, but actually, moving LEFT would require another turn unless it's a straight line.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the snake's direction after each move:

1. Starting at (9,5) facing RIGHT.
2. Move DOWN: now facing DOWN, position (9,4).
3. Turn LEFT (from DOWN, turning LEFT would face RIGHT again?), wait no—that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Each movement command is an absolute direction, not relative to the current heading.

Alternatively, if each move is a change in direction regardless of previous direction, then we can simply list the directions as:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. LEFT
6. LEFT
7. DOWN
8. DOWN
9. DOWN

But this assumes that after each move, the snake can immediately change direction without any constraint.

Therefore, to answer the problem: what is the sequence of moves the snake must make to reach the apple at (4,1), assuming it starts at (9,5) facing RIGHT, and can only move in four directions, changing direction as needed.

The shortest path would be moving DOWN once, then LEFT five times, then DOWN three times. So total moves: 1 +5 +3=9 moves.

Therefore, the sequence of directions is:

DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

But to represent this as a list of moves without considering direction changes, perhaps we can just outline the path in terms of coordinates, but since the problem asks for the number of moves required and possibly the specific moves, I think outlining each step's direction would be appropriate.
</think>

The snake starts at position (9,5) facing RIGHT. To reach the apple at (4,1), it needs to move DOWN once, then LEFT five times, and finally DOWN three more times. Each movement is in one of four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move 1:** The snake moves DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4).
2. **Move 2:** Turn LEFT and move to (8,4).
3. **Move 3:** Continue moving LEFT to (7,4).
4. **Move 4:** Move LEFT again to (6,4).
5. **Move 5:** Another LEFT takes the snake to (5,4).
6. **Move 6:** Left once more to (4,4).
7. **Move 7:** Turn DOWN and move to (4,3).
8. **Move 8:** Continue moving DOWN to (4,2).
9. **Move 9:** Final DOWN move reaches the apple at (4,1).

**Answer:**

The snake must make a total of \boxed{9} moves. The sequence of directions taken is as follows:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. LEFT
6. LEFT
7. DOWN
8. DOWN
9. DOWN
