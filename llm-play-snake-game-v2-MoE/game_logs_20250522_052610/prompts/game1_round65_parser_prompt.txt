<think>
Okay, so I need to help this AI snake eat an apple without dying. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The snake's head is at (8,1), which is near the top-right corner of a 10x10 grid. The current direction is RIGHT. So right now, the snake is moving towards increasing x-values. But wait, that might not be possible because if it continues moving right, it'll hit the wall since x=9 is the maximum. Oh, but the body could block it too.

The apple is at (2,6), which is somewhere in the lower-left part of the grid compared to the head's current position. The snake needs to move from (8,1) to (2,6). Let me calculate the required movement: x decreases by 6 units (since 8-2=6), and y increases by 5 units (6-1=5).

So the moves need to have more LEFTs than RIGHTs by 6, and more UPs than DOWNs by 5. That means overall, the snake needs to move left six times and up five times, possibly with some rights and downs as long as they don't offset these.

Looking at the body cells: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)]. These are all along the x-axis from 3 to 7 at y=1. So if the head is at (8,1) moving right, the next move would take it beyond the grid or into its body.

Wait, no: the current direction is RIGHT, so after this step, the snake's head moves right, but since it's already at x=8, moving right would take it to x=9, which is allowed. But then the body follows, so if the next move continues right, the next head position would be (9,1), and then the body segments would shift.

But wait, the snake can't reverse direction immediately. Since current direction is RIGHT, the first move cannot be LEFT or DOWN? Wait no: rule 3 says that the snake cannot reverse direction. So if it's moving right, next move can't be left. Similarly, for other directions. But in this case, since current direction is RIGHT, the next move cannot be LEFT. It can choose any other direction except LEFT.

Wait, no: the first move after being at direction RIGHT can be any direction except the opposite (LEFT). So from RIGHT, you can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again? Or wait, rule 3 says "cannot reverse direction". Reversing would mean moving back the way it came. So if current direction is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT; if current is UP, next can't be DOWN.

So for this problem, starting from RIGHT, first move cannot be LEFT. But since the head is at (8,1), moving right to (9,1) might not be immediately dangerous unless it's about to collide with its body.

Wait, let me visualize the snake:

Head: (8,1)
Body: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)]

So the body is a chain from (3,4) down to (4,1), then along x-axis to (7,1). So at y=1, the body occupies x=4 to 7. The head is at x=8, so moving right would take it beyond x=9? No, 8+1=9, which is within grid.

But if the snake moves right from (8,1) to (9,1), then the next move could be problematic because the body might block further movement. Alternatively, maybe turning up or down.

Wait, but after moving right once, the body would shift: the new head is at (9,1), and the previous head (8,1) becomes part of the body. So the body now includes all previous cells plus (8,1). Then next move can't be into any of those positions.

But perhaps that's getting ahead of myself. Let me think about possible paths from (8,1) to (2,6), ensuring each step is safe and meets movement constraints.

The apple is at (2,6), which is 6 units left and 5 units up from the head. So overall, the snake needs a net movement of LEFT 6 times and UP 5 times. But considering that the snake can't reverse direction on the first move, and each turn has to follow the rules.

Possible plan: Move up as much as possible while moving left. Let's see.

First, current direction is RIGHT. So initial moves cannot be LEFT. Maybe it's better to start by turning either UP or DOWN but not LEFT.

Wait, but if I turn UP first, then move up a few steps, that might open the path for moving left towards the apple.

But let me think about the body's position. From (8,1), moving right would take head to (9,1). But the next step could be problematic because the body is already at x=4-7 on y=1, and after moving right, (8,1) becomes part of the body.

So if I move right first, then in the next move, I can't go back left. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe moving up first would be better.

Wait, from (8,1), current direction is RIGHT. So first move cannot be LEFT. So possible moves are UP or DOWN or continue RIGHT.

But if I move up to (8,2) right away, then the next step can start moving left towards the apple.

Let me outline a possible path:

Move 1: UP → (8,2)
Now direction is UP. Next move cannot be DOWN.

Move 2: LEFT → (7,2). But wait, after first move up, the body will shift. So I need to make sure that when moving left, I'm not stepping into any part of the body.

Wait, let's think about each step:

1. Current head is at (8,1), direction RIGHT.
   - Body: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)]
   - Tail is at 7,1. So when moving right to (9,1), tail becomes part of body.

But perhaps starting with UP first would be better because it allows more flexibility in movement without immediately hitting the walls or the body.

Let me try:

Move 1: UP → (8,2)
Now direction is UP. Next move cannot be DOWN.

After this move, the new body includes all previous cells plus the old head at (8,1). So body now is [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1)]. And the new head is (8,2).

Now, from here, next moves can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But since we need to move left, let's start moving left.

Move 2: LEFT → (7,2)
Check for collision: body includes up to (8,1), so (7,2) is safe because it's not in the body.

Body now shifts: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)]. So new head at (7,2).

Move 3: LEFT → (6,2)
Check body: no collision. Body adds (7,2) to the list.

Continue this way until x=2 is reached. But wait, that might take too many moves and could hit walls or the body.

Alternatively, maybe moving up a few more steps before turning left would help avoid the body.

Wait, but from (8,2), moving up again would take head to (8,3). Let's see:

Move 1: UP → (8,2)
Move 2: UP → (8,3)
Now direction is still UP. Next move can't be DOWN.

Body after two UP moves: previous body + (8,1) and (8,2).

From (8,3), now can turn LEFT towards the apple.

But wait, the snake's current position is moving up, but the apple is at y=6, which requires a lot of movement. Let me think about how many steps that would take.

Alternatively, maybe a different approach: after moving UP once, then move LEFT multiple times while ensuring each step doesn't hit the body or walls.

Wait, perhaps another way is to calculate the minimal path, but considering the constraints.

The Manhattan distance from (8,1) to (2,6) is |8-2| + |1-6|= 6+5=11. So the minimal number of moves is 11, assuming each move contributes towards the target without backtracking.

But since the snake can't reverse direction on the first move and has to avoid body collisions, perhaps a longer path is needed.

Another approach: The snake needs to make sure that after eating the apple, it still has at least one move left. So when moving towards the apple, we have to ensure that upon reaching it, there's enough space.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline a possible sequence:

1. Move UP from (8,1) → (8,2)
   - Now direction is UP.
   - Body includes (8,1)

2. Move LEFT from (8,2) → (7,2)
   - Check body: (3,4), ..., (8,1). Safe.

3. Move LEFT to (6,2)
   - Body adds (7,2)

4. Continue moving LEFT until x=2:
   Moves 3-?: Moving from x=6 down to x=2 requires 4 LEFT moves. So:

Move 3: LEFT → (5,2)
Move 4: LEFT → (4,2) – wait, but body has a cell at (4,2). Oh no! That would collide.

So that's a problem. At move 4, trying to go from (5,2) to (4,2), which is occupied by the snake's body.

Thus, can't do that. So need another path.

Alternative idea: After moving UP once and LEFT a few times, maybe move UP again to avoid the body at y=2.

Let me try:

Move 1: UP → (8,2)
Body now has (8,1) added.

Move 2: UP → (8,3)
Now, direction is still UP. Next can't go DOWN.

From here, maybe move LEFT a few times.

But wait, the body after two moves includes up to (8,2). So:

Move 3: LEFT → (7,3)

Check if safe: body cells are [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)]. So (7,3) is not in the body, safe.

Move 4: LEFT → (6,3)
Still safe.

Move 5: LEFT → (5,3)
Safe.

Move 6: LEFT → (4,3) – but wait, body has a cell at (4,3). So can't move there.

So again, collision. Hmm.

Alternative approach: After moving UP to (8,2), then maybe turn around and go RIGHT? But no, current direction is UP; next move cannot be DOWN, but can be LEFT or RIGHT or continue UP.

Wait, from (8,2) after first move, direction is UP. So next moves can't be DOWN.

So another idea: After moving UP to (8,2), then turn around and go RIGHT. But that would take us away from the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of starting with UP, start by moving LEFT, but wait, initial direction is RIGHT; first move cannot be LEFT because it's a reverse? Wait no: current direction is RIGHT; reversing would mean moving LEFT. So first move can't be LEFT.

So first move must be either UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

If I choose to move RIGHT instead of UP or DOWN:

Move 1: RIGHT → (9,1)
Body now includes (8,1).

Now, direction is RIGHT; next move cannot be LEFT.

But moving right again would take head to (10,1), which is beyond grid—snake dies. So must change direction after first step.

So from (9,1) with direction RIGHT, next moves can't be LEFT. So perhaps turn UP or DOWN.

Move 2: UP → (9,2)
Body now includes (9,1).

Now, direction is UP; next move can't be DOWN.

From here, moving LEFT towards the apple:

Move 3: LEFT → (8,2)

Check if safe: body includes up to (9,1), so (8,2) is safe.

Move 4: LEFT → (7,2)
Safe.

But wait, earlier problem when trying this path—reaching x=4,y=2 would collide with the body. So perhaps moving further UP first?

Alternatively, after reaching (9,2), move up a few times before turning left.

Move 3: UP → (9,3)
Now direction is still UP; next can't go DOWN.

From here:

Move 4: LEFT → (8,3) – safe?

Body includes (9,1), (9,2). So yes.

Move 5: LEFT → (7,3)

Continue moving left and up until x=2, y=6. But I'm not sure if this will avoid all collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial move should be UP once to (8,2) then proceed to move LEFT as much as possible while avoiding body.

But when moving from (8,2), after first move, can't go LEFT because it's a reverse? Wait no: initial direction was RIGHT; after moving UP, the new direction is UP. So next move cannot be DOWN.

Wait, movement rules state that you cannot make a 180-degree turn on the same step. So if you change direction from RIGHT to UP in the first move, then your next move can't go back down (since it's a 180-degree turn). But moving LEFT or RIGHT is allowed because they're not opposite directions.

Wait no: If current direction is UP, the previous was RIGHT; so for the next move, you can't change to DOWN. So from UP, next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

So after moving UP once, I can proceed to turn LEFT.

But as earlier attempts show, when trying to go LEFT on y=2, it collides with body at (4,2).

Alternative plan: Move up multiple times first before turning left.

Let me try:

Move 1: UP → (8,2)
Direction is UP; next can't be DOWN.

Move 2: UP → (8,3)

Move 3: UP → (8,4)

Move 4: UP → (8,5)

Now at (8,5), direction is UP; can't go DOWN. Next move could be LEFT or RIGHT or continue UP.

From here, move LEFT:

Move 5: LEFT → (7,5)
Safe? Body after four moves includes up to (8,1) and now (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). So yes, (7,5) is safe.

Move 6: LEFT → (6,5)

Move 7: LEFT → (5,5)

Move 8: LEFT → (4,5)

Check for collision: body doesn't have any cell at y=5 except the current path. Wait, body after move 4 includes all previous cells plus up to (8,5). So (4,5) is safe.

Continue moving left:

Move 9: LEFT → (3,5)
But wait, apple is at x=2, so need more steps.

Wait, from x=8 to x=2 requires 6 steps of LEFT. But when moving along y=5, we can do that without hitting the body because the body on that row isn't present except for the current path.

So:

Move 9: LEFT → (3,5)
Move 10: LEFT → (2,5)

Now at (2,5), which is not the apple's position y=6. So need to move up one more step.

But direction after moving left is LEFT; next can't go RIGHT. So from (2,5), can we move UP?

Move 11: UP → (2,6) – success! Reached the apple.

Now, check body:

After all these moves, the body includes all previous positions up to (8,5). So moving to (2,6) is safe because it's not part of the body.

But wait, after eating the apple, does the snake's length change? No, in this case, the apple just ends the movement phase. But we have to ensure that upon reaching the apple, there's still space to move again, but I think as long as we've reached it without collision, it's fine.

So the sequence would be:

1. UP
2. UP
3. UP
4. UP
5. LEFT
6. LEFT
7. LEFT
8. LEFT
9. LEFT
10. LEFT
11. UP

But that seems like 11 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.

Wait, but let's recount:

Move 1: UP → (8,2)
Move 2: UP → (8,3)
Move 3: UP → (8,4)
Move 4: UP → (8,5)
Move 5: LEFT → (7,5)
Move 6: LEFT → (6,5)
Move 7: LEFT → (5,5)
Move 8: LEFT → (4,5)
Move 9: LEFT → (3,5)
Move10: LEFT → (2,5)
Move11: UP → (2,6)

Yes, that's 11 moves. Let me check for collisions at each step.

After Move 1: body includes (8,1); head is (8,2) – safe.
After Move 2: body includes up to (8,2); head (8,3) – safe.
After Move 3: same; head (8,4)
After Move 4: head (8,5)
Then starting to move left:

Move 5: (7,5) not in body
Move6: (6,5)
Move7: (5,5)
Move8: (4,5)
Move9: (3,5)
Move10: (2,5)
Move11: UP to (2,6)

All steps seem safe. So this path should work.

But wait, when moving from (8,5) to (7,5), the body includes up to (8,4). So (7,5) is not part of the body, so it's safe.

Similarly for other moves.

Thus, a possible sequence is:

UP, UP, UP, UP, LEFT six times, then UP once more.

But that totals 11 moves. Alternatively, can we do it in fewer steps? Maybe if we change direction earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps moving up and left alternately to avoid body collisions, but I think the above path works.

Another thing to consider: after eating the apple at (2,6), the snake's tail would have moved forward, so there must be space for movement. But since the apple is the end point, I think it's acceptable as long as the move itself doesn't cause collision.

Thus, the moves would be:

1. UP
2. UP
3. UP
4. UP
5. LEFT
6. LEFT
7. LEFT
8. LEFT
9. LEFT
10. LEFT
11. UP

So in terms of directions: [UP, UP, UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP]

This should get the snake from (8,1) to (2,6) without colliding with its body and within the grid boundaries.
</think>

The optimal path for the snake to reach the apple at position (2, 6) involves moving upward four times followed by six moves to the left, and then one final move upward. This sequence ensures that the snake does not collide with its own body and efficiently navigates towards the target.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake starts at (8, 1) with a direction of RIGHT.
2. **First Four Moves:** The snake moves UP four times to reach (8, 5). This avoids immediate collisions and sets up a clear path.
   - Move 1: UP → (8, 2)
   - Move 2: UP → (8, 3)
   - Move 3: UP → (8, 4)
   - Move 4: UP → (8, 5)
3. **Next Six Moves:** The snake moves LEFT six times to decrease its x-coordinate from 8 to 2.
   - Move 5: LEFT → (7, 5)
   - Move 6: LEFT → (6, 5)
   - Move 7: LEFT → (5, 5)
   - Move 8: LEFT → (4, 5)
   - Move 9: LEFT → (3, 5)
   - Move10: LEFT → (2, 5)
4. **Final Move:** The snake moves UP once to reach the apple at (2, 6).
   - Move11: UP → (2, 6)

**Answer:**

The snake should move Up four times, then Left six times, and finally Up again. This sequence allows it to reach the apple without colliding with its body.

\boxed{[UP, UP, UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP]}
