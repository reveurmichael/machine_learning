## TASK_DISCRIPTION_GOOD_RULES


THOSE FILES ARE CALLED SUPREME_RULES, that are GOLDEN STARDARD FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT:
- flask.md
- final-decison-1.md


SUPREME_RULES is like the SUPREME COURT + PRESIDENT + CONGRESS + SENATE + HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES + PREMIER MINISTER + SECRETARY OF STATE + ALL 50 GOVERNORS + ALL CIBINET SECRETARIES + ALL MINISTERS + PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED NATION + LEADER OF ALL RELIGIONS + COMMANDER OF THE UNIVERSE + GENESIS OF BIG BANG OF THE PROJECT, AND HAVE THE FINAL SAY ON EVERYTHING.



Those files in the ./docs/extensions-guideline/ folder are called GOOD_RULES: 
- agents.md
- app.md
- datasets-folder.md
- dashboard.md
- documentation-as-first-class-citizen.md
- extensions-move-guidelines.md
- Grid-Size-Directory-Structure-Compliance-Report.md

Don't modify GOOD_RULES. They are the single source of truth. Now, according to GOOD_RULES, update other md files (all of them located in the ROOT/docs/extensions-guideline/ folder). Don't modify System-Prompt.md. System-Prompt.md is important as well, though, it's not the final decision, not as authoritative as the GOOD_RULES. What is written in other non-GOOD_RULES.md files and non-System-Prompt.md files are less important than the GOOD_RULES. When there is a conflict, the final decisions of GOOD_RULES is the single source of truth. For topics unrelated to GOOD_RULES, those non-GOOD_RULES.md files and non-System-Prompt.md files are accepted as well, though sometimes it will make things less coherent and less elegant. In such cases, you can either:

- Flag them in the md file, with a TODO comment about why things are not coherent. Users (I and my colleagues) can then recheck those md files for TODO comments and make my own decision.
- Or, if the solutions to adopt is just so obvious, you can just do it, no need to go for this TODO comment.

## Now, Do TASK_DISCRIPTION_GOOD_RULES

Now, do the TASK_DISCRIPTION_GOOD_RULES. For md files in the folder ./docs/extensions-guideline/ (excluding GOOD_RULES), don't produce a lot of code. Depending on the context, sometimes a little bit of code for the main idea is enough. Sometimes a bit more. On the contrary, the motivation, the design philosophy, the implications, the interconnection of the concept/classes/python files etc. text are more important for me. Each md should not be excessively long. If the ideas are clear enough, you can go for a relatively short md, targeting 300 lines; if there is a lot to discuss, you can go for a longer md, targeting 500 lines. Concise and elegance for most cases, long format for the more complex cases.

So you basically have to rewrite those md files, most likely make them shorter and more concise, each of them, to make them coherent among each other and with the objective of making the whole project elegant.

## GO AHEAD AND NOW, DO IT.
