{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"], "reasoning": "To move the snake to eat the apple, we first need to move up from (6, 7) because the apple is located at a lower y-coordinate. Then, we move right as the apple's x-coordinate is greater than the current head position. After that, since the apple's y-coordinate hasn't changed, we continue moving down towards it until we reach it. Once there, we can turn left to eat it."}
