========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to help plan a safe path for the snake's head from (5,5) to reach the apple at (6,5). The snake is currently moving "NONE," which means it hasn't started moving yet. It also has no body segments because the body list is empty. That makes things easier since there's no one in front blocking its path.

First, I need to figure out the direction from (5,5) to (6,5). The apple is directly to the right of the head, so moving RIGHT seems like the obvious choice. But wait, can it move RIGHT immediately without any issues?

I remember that when moving, after each step, the snake's body should stay connected and avoid collisions with itself or walls. Since there are no other body parts blocking the way, moving RIGHT to (6,5) should be straightforward.

Let me check if this causes any immediate collision. The new head position is (6,5), which isn't occupied by any body segments because the body list is empty. Also, it's within the grid bounds since 6 and 5 are both between 0 and 9. So no walls or other snake parts are in the way.

Since the snake can move without growing (because it hasn't eaten an apple yet), after moving RIGHT, the head will be at (6,5). That should end the game successfully because the goal is to reach the apple.

I don't see any issues with reversing direction here because there's no previous movement. The main concern would have been if there were other body parts ahead, but since the snake is length 1, that's not a problem.

So, moving RIGHT once will get the head directly onto the apple without any complications.

```json
{
"moves": ["RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The shortest path from (5,5) to (6,5) is directly to the right. Since there are no other snake body segments blocking this route and moving RIGHT does not cause a collision with walls or self."
}
```
