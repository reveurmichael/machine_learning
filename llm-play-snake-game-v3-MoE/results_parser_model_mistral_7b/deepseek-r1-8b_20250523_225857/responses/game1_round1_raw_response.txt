========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from (5,5) to eat the apple at (5,3). Let's start by visualizing the grid. The head is at (5,5), and the apple is two units below it at (5,3). So, initially, the snake is facing down towards the apple.

The snake has a body that starts with the head at (5,5) followed by (5,4), which means the next segment is directly below the head. The current direction is "NONE", so on the first move, I can choose any valid direction without reversing.

I need to plan a path that avoids collisions and allows the snake to reach the apple safely. Let me consider the movement rules:

1. **Direction Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse directions immediately unless it's the first move. So if I start moving down (towards the apple), my next moves can't be up; they have to be either right, left, or continue down.

2. **Collision Avoidance**: The new head position must not go outside the grid and shouldn't overlap with any body segments except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

3. **Eating the Apple**: When the snake eats the apple, its body grows by one segment, so I need to ensure that after eating, there's still a way to move forward without getting stuck.

Let me outline possible moves:

- Starting at (5,5), with direction "DOWN". Moving down would take the head to (5,4), which is occupied by the first body segment. So that's not allowed.

Wait, that's an issue. The current body includes (5,4) as a body cell, so moving down from (5,5) would make the new head at (5,4), which is already part of the body. That causes a collision because the head can't overlap with any body segments except when the tail is about to move.

Hmm, that means I can't move straight down immediately. Maybe I need to change direction first. Since the initial direction is "NONE", my first move could be in another direction, like left or right, to avoid reversing directions and then come back towards the apple from a different angle.

Let's try moving right first. So, from (5,5), moving right would take me to (6,5). Is that safe? The body segments are only at (5,4), so yes, it's clear. Updating the body: I insert the old head (5,5) at the front, making the new body list [(5,5), (5,4)]. Since I didn't eat the apple, I remove the tail (5,4), leaving the body as [(5,5)].

Now, the snake's direction is "RIGHT". Next move: if I continue right to (7,5), but that's moving away from the apple. Alternatively, changing direction to down would require a turn, which might be allowed since it wasn't a reverse from right to down—it was a right turn initially.

Wait, no, after moving right, the next move can't be up because that would be reversing directions from right to up. But moving down is still possible as long as it's not considered a reversal from right to down. Wait, actually, "RIGHT" and "DOWN" are perpendicular directions, so turning from right to down is allowed since it's not a 180-degree reversal.

So perhaps after moving right once, I can start moving down towards the apple.

Alternatively, maybe moving left first could also work, but that would take me away from the apple as well. So moving right seems better for positioning.

From (6,5), moving down to (6,4). Now, check if this is safe: new head at (6,4) isn't outside the grid and doesn't overlap with any body segments (body is [(5,5)] now). Then, since I didn't eat the apple, I remove the tail, so body becomes empty.

Wait, that's not efficient. Maybe I should plan a path that eventually leads towards (5,3) without getting stuck.

Another approach: After moving right to (6,5), then down twice to reach (6,3). From there, move left two steps to get back to column 5 at row 3, but that might take too many moves and risk collisions with the body or apple.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is to go around. Let's see:

Start at (5,5), direction "RIGHT" to (6,5). Then down twice to (6,4) and (6,3). Now, move left back to (5,3), which is the apple. But wait, moving from (6,3) to (5,3) would require a left move, but that's only one step away.

However, I need to ensure that when I move into (5,3), it's safe. Let me check:

After reaching (6,3), body is [(5,5), (6,5)]. Then, moving left to (5,3). The new head would be at (5,3), which is the apple.

So, step-by-step:

1. Move RIGHT to (6,5): body becomes [(5,5)].
2. Move DOWN to (6,4).
3. Move DOWN again to (6,3).
4. Then, move LEFT to (5,3).

But wait, when moving from (6,3) to (5,3), the new head is at (5,3), which is the apple. So I should check if eating the apple is allowed.

Eating the apple would grow the body by one segment, so after that move, the body would be [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)] and then adding the new head (5,3). Wait, no—when moving into the apple, you add the new head to the front and keep all the body segments except if you grow. So after eating, the body would be [(5,3), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)].

But I need to ensure that after eating, there's still a legal move. Let me check the next possible moves from (5,3). The direction is now "LEFT" because that was the last move. From (5,3), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but can't reverse.

Since the last non-Apple move was LEFT, the next move can be any except RIGHT (if I consider reversing). Wait, no—directions don't reverse unless it's a 180-degree turn. So from "LEFT", you can go UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

So after eating, moving further LEFT isn't helpful because it would take me away from the body. Maybe changing direction to UP could allow me to move around and avoid getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps a different initial path is better. Let's try another approach:

Start at (5,5), move DOWN to (5,4) but that's occupied by the body—so can't do that immediately.

Wait, maybe moving UP first? From (5,5), moving UP would take me to (5,6). But that seems counterintuitive since I need to get down towards the apple. Let me see:

1. Move UP to (5,6): safe.
2. Then, move LEFT twice to (3,6).
3. Then, move DOWN six steps from (3,6) to reach (3,0), which is too far and inefficient.

Not a good idea. So moving UP initially doesn't seem helpful for reaching the apple below.

Back to the first plan: moving RIGHT, then DOWN twice, then LEFT into the apple.

But I need to ensure that after each move, the body remains continuous and that no collisions occur.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Start at (5,5), direction "NONE". First move can be any direction except those that would reverse immediately.
2. Move RIGHT to (6,5). Body becomes [(5,5)].
3. Move DOWN to (6,4). Body is still [(5,5)].
4. Move DOWN again to (6,3). Now, body is [(5,5)] and new head is at (6,3).
5. Then, move LEFT to (5,3), which is the apple.

But wait, when I'm at (6,3), moving LEFT takes me to (5,3). The current body is [(5,5), (6,5)]. Moving into (5,3) would not collide with any body segments because (5,3) is empty. So that's allowed.

Eating the apple: after this move, the new head is at (5,3). Since it's the first time eating, the body grows by one segment. The body becomes [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)] plus the new head, making the full body list as [(5,3), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)].

Now, I need to ensure that after this, there's at least one legal move. From (5,3), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, but can't reverse from the last direction, which was LEFT. So I can go UP or DOWN or continue LEFT.

Moving LEFT again would take me to (4,3). The body is [(5,3), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. Moving LEFT is safe as long as (4,3) isn't occupied by any body segments. It isn't, so that's allowed.

So this path seems feasible. Let me write down the moves:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. LEFT

Wait, but after moving to (6,3), moving LEFT would take me to (5,3). So the fourth move is indeed LEFT.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path, but I need to check for collisions and ensure all steps are safe.

Another consideration: when moving from (6,5) down to (6,4), then again to (6,3), the body remains [(5,5)] until I reach (6,3). So those moves are safe.

So summarizing:

- Move 1: RIGHT to (6,5)
- Move 2: DOWN to (6,4)
- Move 3: DOWN to (6,3)
- Move 4: LEFT to (5,3)

This is four moves. Is there a way to do it in three? Maybe not, because from (6,5), moving down twice gets me to (6,3), and then left to apple.

Alternatively, maybe after the first two moves, I can change direction differently.

But overall, this seems like a viable path without immediate collisions or getting stuck.
</think>

The snake starts at (5,5) with a direction of "NONE". The optimal path involves moving right, then down twice, and finally left to reach the apple. Here's how it unfolds:

1. **Move RIGHT** from (5,5) to (6,5). Body becomes [(5,5)].
2. **Move DOWN** from (6,5) to (6,4). Body remains [(5,5)].
3. **Move DOWN** again from (6,4) to (6,3). Body still [(5,5)].
4. **Move LEFT** from (6,3) to (5,3), successfully eating the apple and growing the body.

This sequence ensures no collisions and allows the snake to reach the apple safely.

**Answer:**
The snake should move right, then down twice, and finally left, resulting in the moves: RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT. The shortest path is achieved by following these four steps.

\boxed{RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT}
