========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to help the snake reach the apple safely without dying. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the current state:
- The head is at (1,5).
- Current direction is "UP", which means next move would be towards higher y-values.
- The body cells are [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]. So from the head, each subsequent segment moves down in y by 1. This forms a vertical line going down.
- The apple is at (5,8).

The snake can only move forward based on its current direction unless it eats the apple. Since it's currently moving "UP", but the body is directly below the head, moving further UP would immediately cause a collision with the body segment behind it.

Let me visualize this:
Current snake position: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]
Apple at (5,8). So to reach the apple from the head, moving RIGHT 4 times and UP 3 times is needed. But I have to plan a path that avoids the snake's own body.

Since the current direction is "UP", but moving further up would lead into the body segment at (1,4), which will be behind after this move. Wait, no—the next head position if moving UP from (1,5) would be (1,6). But since the body already includes (1,4), moving UP to (1,6) won't collide because that cell isn't occupied yet.

Wait, wait! The current direction is "UP", so after this move, the head moves to (1,6). Then, we update the body by inserting the old head at the front. So the new body list becomes [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)], with the tail at (1,1) being removed if not eating the apple.

But before moving, I have to check for collision:
- New head position is (1,6). Is this a body cell? The existing body cells are [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,6) isn't occupied, so no collision.

But after moving, the new body list would be [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)], and then we remove the last element if not eating. Since it's not the apple yet, we remove (1,2), leaving us with [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].

Wait, no—the movement update says:
- Insert old head at front: so new body becomes [old_head] + previous body.
- If no collision and within bounds, proceed to move.

So after moving UP, the snake's new position would be:
New HEAD = (1,6)
BODY becomes [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] → but then we need to remove the tail. Since it's not eating the apple, we remove (1,2). So the new body is [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].

This seems safe because none of these positions overlap with the snake or the apple yet. The apple is at (5,8).

Now, looking ahead: after moving UP once safely, I need to consider future moves. However, if I keep moving UP, the body will extend further down from (1,6) and onwards, but that might not help in reaching the apple.

Alternatively, maybe changing direction now would allow a path towards the apple without getting blocked by the snake's body.

Looking at possible directions:
- Current direction is "UP", so I can't immediately move "DOWN" because of rule 2: cannot reverse.
So next move options are "UP", "LEFT", or "RIGHT".

But moving UP once was safe. Let me confirm again:

Current position after first move (UP):
HEAD at (1,6)
BODY becomes [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] → remove tail to make it [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Is this safe? The new head is at (1,6). It's not in the current body since the existing body after inserting old_head and before removing would be [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]. So it seems okay.

Now, if I move RIGHT next:
New head position would be (2,6). Is this a body cell? Current body is [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)], so no collision. Then update the body by inserting (1,5) at front → [(1,5), (2,6), ... ] and then remove tail if not eating apple.

Wait, but after moving UP once, the snake's body is now shorter because we removed a segment. So when moving RIGHT next time, we have to check that new head position isn't in any current body cells except possibly where it will move later.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to plan more moves ahead. But since I'm only supposed to output initial safe moves, perhaps starting with "UP" is the safest first step as it doesn't lead into immediate collision and opens up a path towards the apple without being blocked by the snake's body.

I should also check if moving in other directions would cause issues, but given that moving UP seems safe and allowed (since current direction is "UP", next move can be same or left/right), choosing "UP" first is reasonable.
</think>

The initial move of "UP" from (1,5) will safely navigate the snake upwards without colliding with its body. This allows for a clear path towards the apple at (5,8).

```json
{
  "moves": ["UP"],
  "reasoning": "Moving UP first is safe and doesn't cause collision with the body or tail."
}
```
```

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (1, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (5, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
