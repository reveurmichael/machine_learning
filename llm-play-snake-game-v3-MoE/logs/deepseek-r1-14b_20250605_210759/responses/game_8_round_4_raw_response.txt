========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the solution for this Snake problem.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake and its environment. The snake's head is at (0,3), which is on the bottom-left side near the center vertically. The body segments are [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)], so the snake is extending to the right from (0,2) to (2,2). The current direction is "UP", meaning the next move without any change would be towards increasing y-values.

The apple is at (1,7), which is near the top-right of the grid. To reach there from (0,3), the snake needs to move right once and up four times. But since the snake can't reverse direction immediately, I need to consider how to maneuver without causing collisions.

I start by checking possible moves from the current position. Since the direction is "UP", the next move can be any except "DOWN". The valid options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Moving UP would take the head to (0,4), which seems safe as it's not colliding with body segments or walls. Moving LEFT isn't possible because x=0 is the boundary. So, moving RIGHT or UP becomes the initial choices.

Choosing RIGHT first makes sense because it starts the snake on a path towards the apple's x-coordinate. However, I need to ensure that this move doesn't lead into any future collisions with the body segments as they shift. Since the body is currently extending downward from (0,2) to (2,2), moving right will change the direction towards the apple without immediate collision.

After moving RIGHT, the head is at (1,3). From here, I can consider moving UP repeatedly to reach y=7. However, each move needs to be checked for collisions with the body segments and ensure that after eating the apple, there's still a way out.

I realize that moving UP four times from (1,3) would take the head to (1,7), which is exactly where the apple is. But I need to make sure that when the snake eats the apple, it doesn't trap itself. This means ensuring that after eating, there's still space for the body to move without blocking the next moves.

Additionally, considering the movement rules, each move should not reverse the direction. So, from UP, we can't go DOWN unless necessary. But since moving RIGHT first breaks away from the current body path, it sets a new trajectory towards the apple.

I also think about the body's growth when eating the apple. By growing, the tail doesn't move, which might leave some space behind to avoid getting stuck. This is crucial because after eating, the snake must have at least one legal move left.

Overall, the plan is to move RIGHT first to start progressing towards the apple's x-coordinate and then proceed UP as much as possible without causing collisions with the body segments.

  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves right to (1,3), then up four times to reach the apple at (1,7). This path avoids immediate collisions and ensures a safe progression towards the target."
