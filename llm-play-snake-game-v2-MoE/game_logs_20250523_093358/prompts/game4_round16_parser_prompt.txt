You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
To plan a safe path for the snake's head from (1, 4) to eat the apple at (6, 5), we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Direction Constraint**: The current direction is DOWN. We cannot move UP on the first step.
2. **Collision Avoidance**: The snake must avoid colliding with its body and the walls of the grid.
3. **Path Planning**: We need a sequence of moves that will take us from (1, 4) to (6, 5).

Let's break down the path planning:

- Start at (1, 4).
- Current direction is DOWN, so we can move: RIGHT or DOWN initially.
- From (1, 4), moving UP is not possible due to direction constraints.

We need to reach (6, 5):
- We must move RIGHT multiple times and UP once.

To move from (1, 4) to (6, 5), we should:
- Move RIGHT until x = 6
- Then adjust y by moving UP

Let's construct the path:

### Step-by-Step Path Construction:

1. Start at (1, 4)
2. Move RIGHT: (2, 4)
3. Move RIGHT: (3, 4)
4. Move RIGHT: (4, 4)
5. Move RIGHT: (5, 4)
6. Move RIGHT: (6, 4)
7. Move UP: (6, 5)

This path avoids all body cells and grid boundaries.

Here's the JSON output with the path:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move RIGHT five times to reach x=6, then UP once to reach y=5."
}
```

This plan ensures we move safely from (1, 4) to (6, 5).
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (1, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)], to eat the apple at (6, 5).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
