You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how the snake can safely move from (2,6) to eat the apple at (3,6). The current direction is "UP", and the body cells are [(2,5), (1,5)]. 

First, let's visualize the grid. The head is at (2,6). The apple is one cell to the right, at (3,6). The snake's body is extending down from the head. Specifically, the next segment is at (2,5) and then (1,5), so the tail is at (1,5).

The current direction is "UP", which means the next move should not reverse to "DOWN". So the snake can't immediately turn around.

Let's consider possible moves:

1. **Move UP**: This would take the head from (2,6) to (2,7). But wait, that's outside the grid because y ranges from 0-9, and 7 is within bounds. However, moving up might not be helpful since the apple is to the right.

2. **Move RIGHT**: The head can move to (3,6), which is exactly where the apple is. That seems like a good move because eating the apple would allow the snake to grow, increasing its length by one. 

But I need to check if moving right is possible without colliding with the body. The current body extends down from (2,6) to (1,5). Moving right would take the head to (3,6), which is currently empty because the apple is there but hasn't been eaten yet. So no collision here.

After eating the apple, the snake's body will grow by one segment. The new body will be [new_head, old_head, (2,5), (1,5)]. But since it ate the apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body length increases without removing the tail.

Wait, no—the rule says that if you eat the apple, you don't remove the tail. So after eating, the body will have an additional segment added at the front when the head moves next time.

But in this case, since we're moving into (3,6) which is the apple, the snake will grow. However, after eating, the snake's new head is at (3,6), and the body includes all previous segments plus the new head. So the tail remains at (1,5).

Now, I need to ensure that after this move, there's at least one legal move next turn to avoid trapping. If the snake moves right into the apple, it grows. The next move would have the head at (3,6), and the body includes all previous segments plus the new head.

From (3,6), possible directions are LEFT or UP/DOWN, but wait—can it reverse? No, because the current direction is "UP". So after eating, what's the new direction?

Actually, when you eat the apple, the next move's direction can be any valid direction except reversing the previous one. Since the last move was RIGHT, which wasn't a reversal, so the next direction can be anything except LEFT if it was previously restricted.

Wait, no—the rule says that on the first move, if current direction is "NONE", any direction is allowed. But after that, you can't reverse unless it's the first move.

In this case, the snake's initial direction is "UP". After moving right to eat the apple, what's the new direction? It would be RIGHT. So next moves can't reverse, meaning they can't go LEFT.

But from (3,6), if the snake is at the top-right corner of a 10x10 grid, there might not be many options. However, since the snake just ate the apple and grew, it's now longer, but still has enough segments to maneuver.

Wait, after eating, the head is at (3,6). The body includes all previous segments plus the new head. So the tail is still at (1,5). So from (3,6), moving left would take it back to (2,6), which is part of the body now—specifically, the next segment after the head.

So moving LEFT would cause a collision because the cell at (2,6) is part of the body except for the tail. Since (2,6) is now BODY1 (the new head's previous position), moving into it would result in a collision.

Therefore, from (3,6), the snake can't move left. It can only move UP or DOWN, but UP might take it to (3,7), which is within bounds and empty. So there are still moves available.

Thus, moving right now seems safe.
</think>

The snake should move right to eat the apple at (3,6). This direction doesn't reverse any prior moves and avoids collision with its body. After eating, the snake grows, ensuring it can still maneuver on the next turn.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Move right to reach the apple, allowing the snake to grow without reversing direction."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(1, 5), (2, 5)], to eat the apple at (3, 6).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
