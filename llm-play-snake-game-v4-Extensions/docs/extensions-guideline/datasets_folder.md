## VITAL: datasets folder naming/placement

✅ **DECISION FINALIZED**: Directory structure has been decided as per final-decision-1.md


VITAL: THIS ONE IS VERY IMPORTANT. It's a single-source-of-truth documentation – applies to **all** extensions.

IMPORTANT FILE THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER IGNORE.




The grid_size should not be fixed to 10, because generated datasets (json files/folders, csv files/folders, jsonl files/folders, etc.) will be stored in ./logs/extensions/datasets/grid-size-N/. The complete structure follows the TaskAwarePathManager pattern defined in final-decision-1.md.

Datasets generated by the heuristics/ML/DL will be stored in:
- **Datasets**: `./logs/extensions/datasets/grid-size-N/{extension_type}_v{version}_{timestamp}/{algorithm_name}/processed_data/`
- **Models**: `./logs/extensions/models/grid-size-N/{extension_type}_v{version}_{timestamp}/{model_name}/model_artifacts/`
