BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I need to help this snake eat the apple at (5,9) starting from (5,6). The current direction is LEFT, and the body cells are [(6,6), (6,5)]. Let me visualize the grid.

First, the head is at (5,6), which is in the middle of the grid. The apple is directly to the right along the same y-coordinate but higher x-value—wait no, looking back, actually, wait: the coordinates are given as (x,y), with (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at the top-right. So moving up increases y.

Wait, so the apple is at (5,9). That's the same x as the head, but higher y—so it's directly above, three steps up.

So from (5,6), to get to (5,9), the snake needs to move UP three times. But let me check if that's possible without collision.

The current body is [(6,6), (6,5)], so after the head, the next segment is at (6,6). Wait, that's to the right of the head? Hmm, but the direction is LEFT, which would mean moving towards lower x-values. So the snake was previously moving left, and now the head is at (5,6), with body segments behind it.

Wait, let me reconstruct the current state:

Head: (5,6)
Body cells: [(6,6), (6,5)]—so after the head comes (6,6), then (6,5). So the snake's path was moving right before, but now the direction is LEFT. Hmm.

Wait, that might be a problem because if the current direction is LEFT, the next move would have to be in the same direction or any except RIGHT (since you can't reverse). Wait, no—the rules say you cannot choose the opposite direction as the current one. So current direction is LEFT; next move can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again, but not RIGHT.

Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. The movement rules state that you can't reverse: if current direction is "UP", you can't choose "DOWN" next. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So from LEFT, the possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT itself. But moving in the same direction would mean continuing in the same path.

But wait, the problem says that the initial direction is LEFT, so the first move cannot be RIGHT because it's the opposite. So I can choose UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

So the goal is to get from (5,6) to (5,9), which is three steps up. But let me check if moving straight up is possible without collision.

If I move UP once: new head would be (5,7). Check for collisions:

- The body cells are [(6,6), (6,5)]. After the move, the body will shift. Let's think about how the body moves.

Wait, when you make a move, first you compute the new head. Then check if it collides with anyBODYi except possibly the tail in this step.

So after moving UP to (5,7), the new head is safe because the body cells are at (6,6) and (6,5), which are not adjacent to (5,7). So no collision.

Then, update the body. Since we're not eating an apple here, we add the old head to the front of the body list and remove the tail.

Old body: [(6,6), (6,5)] → after moving up:

new_head = (5,7)
old_head is (5,6)

So new body becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ]? Wait no—step 3a says insert the old head at front of BODY. So body was [(6,6), (6,5)], inserting (5,6) makes it [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]. Then, since we didn't eat apple, remove tail: so new body is [(5,6), (6,6)].

So the snake's state becomes head at (5,7), body cells [(5,6), (6,6)].

Now, next move: let's try moving UP again to (5,8).

New head: (5,8). Check collisions:

Body is [(5,6), (6,6)]. So (5,8) is not in the body. Safe.

Update body: insert old head (5,7) → body becomes [(5,7), (5,6), (6,6)], then remove tail → [(5,7), (5,6)].

Now head at (5,8). Next move UP to (5,9).

Check collision: body is [(5,7), (5,6)]. So new head (5,9) not in body. Safe.

Update body: insert old head (5,8) → [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)], and since we didn't eat apple yet? Wait no—the apple is at (5,9). So when moving to (5,9), the new_head equals apple position. Therefore, step 3b applies: grow without removing tail.

So body becomes [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)] → wait, but after inserting old head (5,8) at front, and since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So body is now [ (5,8), (5,7), (5,6) ].

Wait no—initial body before this move was [(5,7), (5,6)]. After moving to (5,9):

- Insert old head (5,8) at front: body becomes [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].
- Since new_head == apple, grow by not removing tail. So the body remains as [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].

So after eating, the snake's head is at (5,9) and the body cells are [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. Now, check if there's a legal next move: because after eating, you must have at least one move left. So what direction can we choose?

Current direction was UP for the last three moves. Next possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Can't go RIGHT.

So from (5,9), moving UP would take us out of bounds (y=10 is invalid). Moving DOWN to (5,8) which is in the body—since we're at (5,9), moving down takes us to (5,8), which is part of the body. But wait, when you move, you check if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

In this case, after eating, the body cells are [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. The tail is at (5,6). So if we move DOWN from (5,9) to (5,8), which is in the body. But wait, since the tail is at (5,6), and when moving down, the new head would be (5,8), which is in the body list—BODYi includes (5,8), so collision occurs.

So that's a problem. Therefore, after eating, we can't move DOWN because it would collide with (5,8). What about LEFT or RIGHT?

Wait, current direction was UP; next moves can be UP, DOWN, LEFT. Wait no: the last direction was UP, so next directions cannot be DOWN.

So possible directions are UP, LEFT.

UP is invalid as it's out of bounds. So only LEFT is an option. Moving LEFT from (5,9) would take us to (4,9). Check if that's safe.

New head would be (4,9). The body after eating is [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. So (4,9) isn't in the body—safe. Then update body:

Insert old head (5,9) → body becomes [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)] since we ate apple and didn't remove tail.

Wait no: after eating apple, step 3b says do not remove the tail this turn. So body was [ (5,8), (5,7), (5,6) ] → insert old head (5,9) at front → [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. Since we ate apple, don't remove the tail—so body remains as is. Then set HEAD to (4,9).

Wait no: when moving LEFT from (5,9):

- New head is (4,9). Check collision: not in body.

- Insert old head (5,9) at front of BODY → [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].

- Since new_head != apple (we already ate it), so we remove the tail: which was (5,6). So body becomes [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7)].

But wait, after eating the apple, in that move, do you have to check for collision with the next possible tail movement? Or is this only when not eating?

Wait, the collision happens before updating the body. So after moving to (5,9) and eating the apple, we need to ensure that in the next move, there's at least one valid direction.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me retrace:

After three UP moves, the snake reaches the apple at (5,9), and then must make a fourth move (directions can't reverse). But after eating, the next move could be LEFT to (4,9), which is safe. So the initial plan was to move UP three times.

But I think this approach might work, but I need to ensure that after each step, there are no collisions and that after eating, a valid move exists.

Wait another thing: when moving from (5,6) to (5,7), the body cells become [(5,6), (6,6)]—no collision. Then moving to (5,8): body becomes [(5,7), (5,6)], so no collision at (5,8). Then moving to (5,9): body is [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)], and new head is safe.

But after eating, next move can't be DOWN because it would hit (5,8). So only LEFT or UP. But UP from (5,9) is invalid. So must choose LEFT.

So perhaps the plan is: move UP three times to reach the apple, then move LEFT once, and that's acceptable as long as there's at least one more move possible. Wait no—the problem says after eating, you need to have a legal next step.

In this case, after moving to (5,9), you have to choose a direction for the next move, but since it's required to have at least one valid direction, which is LEFT in this case, that's acceptable.

But wait, no: the problem states that after eating, you must have at least one possible move. So if after eating, there are no possible moves left (i.e., all directions result in collision or out of bounds), then it's invalid. But in our case, after eating, moving LEFT is possible to (4,9), which is safe.

But wait, what about the direction chosen? Because you have to choose a direction each time. So after reaching the apple and growing, the next move can be made. Therefore, moving UP three times is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another path. Let me think: maybe making some turns before getting to (5,9).

Wait, but that would complicate things. Since the straight line up is possible, why take a longer route? So the minimal moves are three UPs and then one LEFT, totaling four moves. But wait, no—the apple is at (5,9), so only three UP moves from (5,6). Then you have to make another move because the game probably continues until all food is eaten.

But perhaps in this case, the solution is just to move UP three times and then LEFT once, totaling four steps. But let me verify each step for collision.

First move: from (5,6) to (5,7):

- New head: (5,7).

- Body before update: [(6,6), (6,5)].

- No collision with new head, so safe.

Body after update: insert (5,6) → [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5)], then remove tail (6,5) → body becomes [(5,6), (6,6)].

Second move: from (5,7) to (5,8):

- New head: (5,8).

- Body before update: [(5,6), (6,6)].

- No collision.

Body after update: insert (5,7) → [(5,7), (5,6), (6,6)], remove tail (6,6) → body becomes [(5,7), (5,6)].

Third move: from (5,8) to (5,9):

- New head: (5,9).

- Body before update: [(5,7), (5,6)].

- No collision.

Body after update: insert (5,8) → [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. Since we ate the apple, don't remove tail. So body becomes [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].

Now, check next move directions:

Current direction was UP; cannot choose DOWN.

Possible moves: UP (invalid), LEFT, or same direction? Wait no—the rules say you can't reverse. Since the last move was UP, next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT? No—wait the initial problem says "You are not allowed to reverse direction." So if current direction is UP, next moves cannot be DOWN.

Wait no: let me check the original problem statement:

"You are not allowed to reverse direction."

So if current direction is LEFT, you can't go RIGHT. Similarly, if current is UP, can't go DOWN; DOWN can't go UP; RIGHT can't go LEFT.

Therefore, after moving UP three times, the next move must be UP, LEFT, or same as previous (UP). Wait no—no: each step's direction is independent except for the restriction on reversing. So from UP, you can choose any direction except DOWN.

So from (5,9), possible directions are UP (invalid), LEFT, and RIGHT.

Wait, but wait—the direction after moving UP three times would be UP as the last move. So next move can't be DOWN.

But can we choose to go LEFT or RIGHT?

Yes: because current direction is UP; can't choose DOWN.

So from (5,9), possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

UP is invalid (y=10). LEFT leads to (4,9); RIGHT leads to (6,9).

Both are safe as they're not in the body.

But wait, moving RIGHT would take us to (6,9), which is not in the current body [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. So that's also a possible move. But why choose LEFT? Well, perhaps either direction is fine.

Wait, but after eating, do we have to make sure there are legal moves left? Because when you eat the apple, you grow, and then in the next step, you must be able to move.

In our case, moving from (5,9) can go LEFT or RIGHT. So both directions are valid. Therefore, it's safe.

But perhaps moving UP three times is sufficient as per the problem statement, which only asks for a sequence of moves that eats all apples. But since there's only one apple here, moving UP three times to eat it would suffice, but we have to ensure that after eating, we can still move—because otherwise, if you can't move anymore, that might be an issue.

Wait no—the problem doesn't specify continuing after eating; perhaps the goal is just to find a sequence that allows the snake to eat all apples without dying. So as long as each move is valid (no collision and within bounds), it's acceptable.

Therefore, moving UP three times would allow the snake to reach the apple at (5,9) without any collisions in between. Then, after eating, you can make a legal move (LEFT or RIGHT). But since the problem doesn't require further moves beyond eating the apple, perhaps just reaching it is enough.

Wait no—the question says "You are given an initial position and direction of a snake." So the process continues until all apples are eaten. But in this case, there's only one apple to eat at (5,9). So once that's done, the game might end.

But according to the rules, after eating, you must have at least one possible move left. Otherwise, it's an invalid path.

So let me verify:

After moving UP three times to eat the apple, the next step requires a valid direction.

From (5,9), possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT, both leading to safe positions.

Therefore, the sequence of moves is: UP, UP, UP.

But wait, after each move, the body changes. Let me simulate all steps carefully.

Initial state:

Head: (5,6)
Body: [(6,6), (6,5)]
Direction: LEFT

Move 1: UP to (5,7)

- New head: (5,7)
- Check collision: not in body.
- Body becomes [(5,6), (6,6)] after update.

Move 2: UP to (5,8)

- New head: (5,8)
- Not in body [(5,6), (6,6)]
- Body becomes [(5,7), (5,6)]

Move 3: UP to (5,9)

- New head: (5,9)
- Not in body [(5,7), (5,6)]
- Eat apple at (5,9). So body becomes [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)] without removing tail.

After eating, check next possible move:

From (5,9), directions can be UP (invalid), LEFT (to 4,9), RIGHT (to 6,9).

Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe. So it's a valid path.

Therefore, the answer is to move UP three times.
</think>

The snake needs to move up three times to reach the apple located at (5,9) without colliding with its body.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Position:**
   - Head: (5,6)
   - Body: [(6,6), (6,5)]
   - Direction: LEFT

2. **Move 1: UP to (5,7):**
   - New head: (5,7)
   - No collision with body.
   - Update body: Insert old head (5,6) at front → [(5,6), (6,6)]. Remove tail (6,5). Body becomes [(5,6), (6,6)].

3. **Move 2: UP to (5,8):**
   - New head: (5,8)
   - No collision with body [(5,6), (6,6)].
   - Update body: Insert old head (5,7) → [(5,7), (5,6)]. Remove tail (6,6). Body becomes [(5,7), (5,6)].

4. **Move 3: UP to (5,9):**
   - New head: (5,9)
   - No collision with body [(5,7), (5,6)].
   - Eat the apple at (5,9).
   - Update body: Insert old head (5,8) → [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. Do not remove tail since an apple was eaten.

After these moves, the snake successfully eats the apple. Each move is valid as they don't cause any collision and are within bounds.

**Answer:** The snake should move UP three times in sequence to eat the apple.
