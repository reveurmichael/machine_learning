========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the AI agent should move the snake to eat the apple without dying. Let's start by understanding the current state of the game.

The head is at (8,1), which is near the top-right corner since y increases upwards. The apple is at (1,4), which is much lower on the left side. So the snake needs to move left and up a bit because from (8,1) to (1,4) means moving left by 7 units and up by 3 units.

The current direction is DOWN, so the first move can't be UP because that would reverse direction. Wait, no—rule 3 says you can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. But in this case, the current direction is DOWN, and the initial movement from the example is moving to (8,1) to eat the apple.

Wait, the head is at (8,1), and the body cells are [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So the snake is a vertical line going down from (8,5) to (8,2). The current direction is DOWN, meaning the head was moving down. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if the head is at (8,1) and it's moving DOWN, then the next body cells would be after moving further down. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the movement.

Wait, actually, the body cells are [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], which means that the snake is in a straight line from (8,5) to (8,2). The head is at (8,1), so the next cell after moving would be (8,0), but since it's direction DOWN, which decreases y. Wait, no—DOWN is y-1, so if the current position is (8,1), moving DOWN would take it to (8,0). But that's outside the grid because y can't be less than 0. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, looking back, the movement vectors are UP: (0,1) which increases y, DOWN: (0,-1) which decreases y. So from (8,1), moving DOWN would take it to (8,0). But the grid is from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) top-right, so (8,0) is within bounds.

Wait no, because the snake's body cells are [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], which suggests that after moving, the tail would have been removed unless an apple was eaten. But in this case, I don't know if the apple has been eaten yet.

Wait, no—the apple is at (1,4), so it's a separate position. So the snake's body is along x=8 from y=5 to y=2, and the head is at (8,1). So moving DOWN would take the head to (8,0), which is within bounds because y can be 0.

But wait, moving DOWN when current direction is DOWN might cause a collision with the body? Let's see: after moving DOWN, the new head would be (8,0), and then the body cells shift. But I'm not sure if that's allowed because the body is currently at higher y positions, so maybe it's okay.

But wait, the first move can't reverse direction. Since current direction is DOWN, next move cannot be UP. So from DOWN, possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT? Because moving in the same direction (DOWN again) would be allowed, right?

Wait, no—rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. Reversing direction would be going back, but moving in the same direction is fine.

So the first move can be DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, from (8,1), moving DOWN takes it to (8,0). Moving LEFT would take it to (7,1), and moving RIGHT would take it beyond the grid because x can't exceed 9, but 8+1=9 is okay.

But let's think about the path. The apple is at (1,4), which is far left and a bit up from (8,1). So the snake needs to move left multiple times and also up a few times.

So perhaps the optimal path would involve moving LEFT several times, then maybe some UP moves. But I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause collision with the body or walls.

Let's break down the required movement:

From (8,1) to (1,4):

Δx = 1 - 8 = -7 → so we need 7 more LEFT moves than RIGHT moves.

Δy = 4 - 1 = +3 → so we need 3 more UP moves than DOWN moves.

So the total moves must have a net of 7 LEFT and 3 UP. So possible moves could be: all LEFTs except for some corrections, but that's not feasible because sometimes you might need to move up or down to avoid collisions.

But first, let's see the current position and body:

Head is at (8,1), body cells are [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So the snake is a vertical line from (8,5) down to (8,2), with head at (8,1). If the current direction is DOWN, then the next move would be further down, but that's possible as long as it doesn't hit the body.

Wait, if the head moves DOWN from (8,1) to (8,0), which is outside the body. Because the body cells are at y=5,4,3,2. So moving DOWN from (8,1) would take it to (8,0), which is not part of the body yet. But wait, when you move, the head moves first, and then the body follows.

Wait no, in each step:

- New head = current head + direction.
- Then, each body cell moves into the next position, except the tail if no apple was eaten.

But since the apple is at (1,4), which is not the same as the current head position, so when we make a move, the snake's tail will shrink unless the apple is eaten. But in this case, the apple hasn't been eaten yet; it's at (1,4). So each move after the first step, the tail is removed.

So for the initial moves:

If I choose to go LEFT from (8,1), then the new head would be (7,1). Then the body cells shift: (8,5) becomes (8,4), etc., and the tail at (8,2) is removed. So after moving LEFT once, the body becomes [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], but wait no—after the head moves to (7,1), the body cells move forward, so the first body cell (8,5) would become (8,4), then (8,4) becomes (8,3), etc., and the tail is removed. So the new body after moving LEFT would be [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], but wait that's only three cells because one was lost as the head moved.

Wait no—the body list given is of length 4, which makes sense because each step adds a cell when apple is eaten. So initially, without having eaten the apple yet, the snake would have body cells of length n-1 where n is the number of moves? Not sure, but in any case, after moving LEFT from (8,1), the new head is (7,1), and the body follows.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact movement steps. Maybe it's better to plan a path that avoids collision with the body.

So starting at (8,1). Let's see possible first moves:

If current direction is DOWN, then next move cannot be UP. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN.

But moving DOWN would take head to (8,0), which is outside of the grid? Wait no—y can go down to 0, since y ranges from 0 to 9. So (8,0) is valid.

Wait, but if the snake's body is at (8,5), (8,4), etc., moving DOWN would take head to (8,0). Then, after that move, the body cells would shift: (8,5) → (8,4), and so on. So the new body would be [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], but wait, no—the body list given is length 4, so after moving DOWN once, the tail would be removed because the apple hasn't been eaten yet. So the new body cells would be [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]? Wait I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to avoid moving DOWN initially because the apple is at a higher x coordinate, but wait no—the apple is at (1,4). So lower x. So we need to move left.

So first move should be LEFT or RIGHT. But current direction is DOWN, so can't reverse by moving UP.

Wait, the initial movement from (8,1) needs to get towards (1,4), which requires a lot of LEFT moves. Let's see:

Option 1: Start with LEFT.

Move 1: LEFT → (7,1). Now check if this is safe. The new head is at (7,1). Body cells after movement would be [(8,5) becomes (8,4), (8,4) becomes (8,3), etc.] Wait no—when the head moves, each body cell follows. So moving LEFT from (8,1), the next position is (7,1). The previous body cells are at (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2). After moving, the new body would be [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)] but that's only three cells. Wait no—the initial body has four cells, so after moving, the head is at (7,1), and the body becomes [(8,5) moves to (8,4), (8,4) → (8,3), etc.] So the new body would be [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], but that's three cells because one was lost as the head moved. But wait, no—the body list length remains the same unless an apple is eaten. Wait, no—without eating an apple, each move reduces the body size by 1 because the tail is removed.

Wait, when you move without eating an apple, the snake's body shifts forward, and the last cell (tail) is removed. So if the initial body has four cells (excluding head), after moving, it would have three cells: the first becomes second, etc., and the tail is gone. But in our case, we're moving towards the apple, so we'll eat it at some point.

But for the first few moves, before eating the apple, each move reduces the body length by one. So after the first move, the body would be [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]—three cells. Then, in the next move, if we again don't eat the apple, it becomes two cells.

But I'm not sure about this, but let's proceed.

So moving LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1). Is that safe? The body after movement would be [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So none of these are at (7,1), so it's safe. So first move is LEFT.

Then, next moves should continue moving left towards the apple.

Wait, but the apple is at (1,4). So from (7,1), we can keep moving LEFT each time until x=1. But wait, that would require 6 more LEFT moves, which might take us into a collision with the body or walls.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving LEFT once to (7,1), the next step is to move UP to start climbing towards y=4.

Wait, let's think about possible collisions. After first move: head at (7,1), body cells [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So no collision.

Next move options:

Current direction after moving LEFT would be LEFT? Or can we change direction?

Yes, because the initial direction was DOWN, and after moving LEFT, the new direction is LEFT. Next move cannot reverse, so from LEFT, next moves can't be RIGHT.

So second move: perhaps UP to start moving towards y=4.

Move 2: UP → (7,2). Check if this position is safe. The body cells are now [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So the new head is at (7,2), which isn't in the body, so it's safe.

Then, move 3: continue moving UP → (7,3).

Move 4: UP again → (7,4). Now we're at y=4. But the apple is at (1,4), so x needs to decrease by 6 more steps.

But let's see what the body looks like after each move.

After first move (LEFT): head=(7,1), body=[(8,5)→(8,4), (8,4)→(8,3), (8,3)→(8,2)] → body=[(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].

Wait no—the initial body was [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. After moving LEFT to (7,1), the new body cells are the previous ones shifted: so the first cell (8,5) becomes (8,4), (8,4)→(8,3), etc. So after move 1, the body is [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].

After move 2 (UP to (7,2)), the new head is at (7,2). The body becomes [ (8,4) → (8,3), (8,3)→(8,2), (8,2)→(8,1) ]? Wait no—the movement of each body cell follows the direction of the head. So moving UP from (7,1) to (7,2), each body cell moves up as well.

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to model it step by step:

Move 0: Head=(8,1), Body=[(8,5),(8,4),(8,3),(8,2)].

Move 1: Direction=LEFT → new head=(7,1). New body is [(8,5)→(8,4), (8,4)→(8,3), (8,3)→(8,2)]. So the new body list is [(8,4),(8,3),(8,2)].

Move 2: Now direction=LEFT's next move can't be RIGHT. But if I choose to move UP instead, which is allowed because previous direction was LEFT. Wait no—can you change direction each time as long as you don't reverse?

Wait the rule is that you cannot make a U-turn. So from LEFT, you can't go RIGHT in the next step. From UP, you can't go DOWN.

But perhaps for simplicity, let's assume that after moving LEFT, we can choose any direction except RIGHT.

So move 2: Direction=UP → new head=(7,2). The body cells move accordingly: each cell moves up by one, so (8,4)→(8,3), (8,3)→(8,2), (8,2)→(8,1).

But wait the new body would be [(8,3),(8,2),(8,1)]. So the new head is at (7,2), and the body cells are [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1)].

Is (7,2) colliding with any of these? No. So safe.

Move 3: Direction=UP again → head=(7,3). Body cells move up to [(8,2), (8,1), (8,0)]. Head is at (7,3), which doesn't collide with body.

Move 4: UP → (7,4). Now check if this is safe. The apple is at (1,4), but we're not there yet. So the body cells after move 4 would be [(8,1)→(8,0)], etc., but I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that once we reach y=4, which is where the apple is, we can start moving left towards x=1.

But let's see:

After several moves up, we're at (7,4). Now, the next step would be to move LEFT again, but let's check if that's safe.

Wait, perhaps there's a better path. Maybe after moving LEFT once, instead of moving UP, move further LEFT until x=1, then UP.

But I'm not sure about that because without changing y, moving left might cause the body cells to catch up.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible to spiral around or find another path.

Wait another approach: since the apple is at (1,4), which is in column 2. Maybe after moving LEFT a few times and then UP.

But perhaps I should try to outline a step-by-step plan:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,1). Body becomes [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].
Move 2: LEFT again? But current direction is LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT. So moving LEFT again would go to (6,1).

But then the body cells after move 2: each cell moves LEFT as well. Wait no—the body cells are at [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], but if head moves LEFT to (6,1), the body cells shift accordingly. So new body would be [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]. But wait that's not correct because each cell follows the direction of the head. Wait no—the body cells are in the same column as the initial position until movement.

Wait I'm getting stuck on this, so perhaps it's better to assume that moving LEFT from (8,1) is safe and then proceed to move UP towards y=4 after a few steps.

Alternatively, maybe the first step should be DOWN instead of LEFT. Let's see:

If move 1: DOWN → (8,0). Is this safe? The body cells are at [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. After moving DOWN, the new head is at (8,0), and the body cells become [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So no collision.

Then move 2: can't go UP because that would reverse direction. So options are LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN again.

But since we need to get to x=1, perhaps moving LEFT is better.

Move 2: LEFT → (7,0). Check body cells after this move: each cell moves LEFT as well? Or follow the head's movement?

No, the body cells shift in the same direction as the head. So from (8,0) moving LEFT to (7,0), the body cells would also move LEFT. Wait no—each body cell follows the previous position.

Wait I think I'm overcomplicating it again. Let's try:

Move 1: DOWN → (8,0). Body becomes [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].
Move 2: LEFT → (7,0). Now, body cells are [(7,4), (7,3), (7,2)]. So the head is at (7,0), which doesn't collide with any body cell.

But then moving further left from (7,0) would be possible, but the apple is at y=4. So perhaps after several moves left, we can move up to reach y=4.

Wait but this might not be efficient because it requires a lot of steps and possible collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps starting with LEFT is better.

Let me try that again:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,1). Body becomes [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].
Move 2: UP → (7,2). Body cells become [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1)].
Move 3: UP → (7,3). Body cells become [(8,2), (8,1), (8,0)].
Move 4: UP → (7,4). Now at y=4. The apple is at (1,4).

Now, we need to move left from x=7 to x=1 in the same row y=4.

So next moves would be LEFT each time:

Move 5: LEFT → (6,4).
Check body cells after move 4: [(8,2), (8,1), (8,0)]. After moving LEFT to (6,4), the new body cells are [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0)].

Wait but the head is at (6,4) and body cells are now at [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0)], so no collision.

Move 5: LEFT → (6,4). Safe.
Move 6: LEFT → (5,4).
Body after move 5: [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0)].
After moving to (5,4), body becomes [(6,2), (6,1), (6,0)].

Wait no—each body cell follows the direction of the head. So if we're moving LEFT from (6,4) to (5,4), each body cell also moves LEFT. But I think I'm making a mistake here because the body cells are in different columns and rows.

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to assume that as long as the new head position doesn't overlap with any of the current body cells, it's safe.

So after move 4: head=(7,4), body=[(8,2), (8,1), (8,0)].

Move 5: LEFT → (6,4). Check if (6,4) is in body. The body cells are at x=8, so no collision. Safe.
Body after move 5: [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0)].

Move 6: LEFT → (5,4). Body becomes [(6,2), (6,1), (6,0)].
No collision.

Continue this until x=1.

Move 7: LEFT → (4,4).
Body after move 6: [(5,2), (5,1), (5,0)]. Safe.

Move 8: LEFT → (3,4). Body becomes [(4,2), (4,1), (4,0)].
Safe.

Move 9: LEFT → (2,4). Body becomes [(3,2), (3,1), (3,0)].
Safe.

Move 10: LEFT → (1,4). Now the head is at (1,4), which is where the apple is. So we eat it!

At this point, since we ate the apple, the body length increases by one because we don't lose the tail. But in our case, after moving to (1,4), the body cells would be [(2,2), (2,1), (2,0)] plus the new cell from the movement. Wait no—the apple is at (1,4), so when we move into it, we add a new segment.

But I'm not entirely sure about how the body updates when eating an apple, but assuming that after eating the apple, the snake's length increases, which could help in future movements.

So total moves: 10 steps. Wait no—let me recount:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,1)
Move 2: UP → (7,2)
Move 3: UP → (7,3)
Move 4: UP → (7,4)
Move 5: LEFT → (6,4)
Move 6: LEFT → (5,4)
Move 7: LEFT → (4,4)
Move 8: LEFT → (3,4)
Move 9: LEFT → (2,4)
Move 10: LEFT → (1,4)

So yes, it takes 10 moves. But wait, when you eat the apple at move 10, do you need to continue? Or does that complete the task?

Yes, because after eating the apple at (1,4), we've reached the target. So the answer is 10 moves.

But let me check if there's a shorter path. Maybe instead of moving all the way up first, then left, perhaps interleaving movements could be faster.

Alternative approach:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,1). Body=[(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].
Move 2: UP → (7,2). Body=[(8,3), (8,2), (8,1)].
Move 3: LEFT → (6,2). Now, body cells are [(7,3), (7,2), (7,1)]. But wait, the head is at (6,2) and the body cells are at x=7. No collision.

Move 4: UP → (6,3). Body=[(7,2), (7,1), (7,0)].
Move 5: LEFT → (5,3). Body becomes [(6,2), (6,1), (6,0)].
Move 6: UP → (5,4). Now at y=4. Body=[(6,1), (6,0), (5,3)].

Wait this might not be efficient either.

Alternatively, perhaps moving diagonally isn't possible, so each move is one step in a single direction.

Another idea: after reaching (7,4), instead of moving all the way left to x=1, perhaps make some U-turns or moves that allow shorter path, but I don't think it's possible because you can't reverse direction immediately.

Wait wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. From (8,1), if we move DOWN first, then LEFT multiple times, then UP.

Let me try:

Move 1: DOWN → (8,0). Body=[(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].
Move 2: LEFT → (7,0). Body=[(8,3), (8,2), (8,1)] but wait, the body cells are at x=8 and y decreasing. So after moving LEFT to (7,0), each body cell also moves LEFT? Or do they follow the previous positions.

I think I'm making a mistake in how the body updates. Each time you move, all the body segments follow the path of the head's movement from their current position. So for example:

Move 1: DOWN → (8,0). Body is now [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].
Wait no, that doesn't make sense because if you're moving DOWN from (8,1) to (8,0), the body cells should also move DOWN. So the initial body after move 1 would be [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], but when head moves DOWN, each body cell also moves DOWN one step.

Wait that can't be right because if all body cells moved down by one from their original positions, they'd end up at [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1)] instead of [(8,4), etc.]. I think I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps it's better to model the snake as a list where each segment follows the previous one. So when the head moves, each body segment takes the position of the previous segment.

For example:

Initial: Head=(8,1), Body=[(8,5), (8,4), (8,3)].

Wait wait no—original setup was:

Start at (8,1). The snake's body is three segments behind. So initial positions are:

Segment 0: (8,1) – head
Segment 1: (8,2)
Segment 2: (8,3)
Segment 3: (8,4)

Wait no, wait—the snake is a line of four cells? Or is it just the head and body segments. Wait in many snake games, the length increases when you eat food, but initially, it's just the head plus some body.

In this problem, initial position is at (8,1), with three other body segments behind it: [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]. Because from 8 to 5 in y-direction, so they are below the head. Wait no—if the grid is like rows and columns, perhaps I'm mixing up.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial snake is at position (1,8) with body segments extending towards higher x or something else. But this is getting too ambiguous.

Wait let's clarify: The starting position is at coordinates (x=8, y=1). So on a grid where x increases to the right and y increases upwards, that would be near the bottom-right corner.

The initial body of the snake is three segments behind the head. So after the head moves LEFT once, those body segments will follow accordingly.

But perhaps it's better to give up trying to model the exact movement and instead find a minimal path.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal number of steps required is 9: moving from (8,1) to (1,4), which is a Manhattan distance of |8-1| + |1-4| = 7+3=10. But since you can't move diagonally and need to make separate moves for x and y directions, it would take at least 10 steps.

But wait, considering the initial position, perhaps some steps are blocked by the body, requiring additional moves, making the minimal number higher than 10.

In the earlier approach, moving LEFT then UP takes 4 steps to reach (7,4), and then another 6 steps left to reach (1,4), totaling 10 moves. So that's consistent with the Manhattan distance.

But in reality, because of the body's presence, you might need more steps, but perhaps not necessarily.

Alternatively, maybe a better path exists where after moving up, you can move around without collision.

After trying various paths, it seems that at least 10 moves are required. Therefore, I think the answer is \boxed{10}.
</think>

The minimal number of moves required for the snake to reach the target position (1,4) from its initial position (8,1) is determined by calculating the Manhattan distance and considering the path without collision with the body segments.

1. **Initial Position**: The snake starts at (8,1).
2. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**: The distance to (1,4) is |8-1| + |1-4| = 7 + 3 = 10.
3. **Path Planning**: 
   - Move LEFT four times to reduce x-coordinate from 8 to 4, moving into y=4 as needed.
   - Then move UP to reach y=4.
   - Finally, move LEFT six more times to reach x=1.

After careful consideration and planning the path without collision with body segments, the minimal number of moves required is found to be 10.

\boxed{10}
