========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left once and up six times to reach the apple at (5,7). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing direction and navigates around the body. Subsequent UP moves ascend toward the apple, with a LEFT detour to avoid colliding with the body segment at (5,5). Finally, a RIGHT move aligns horizontally with the apple, followed by an UP move to reach it. This path ensures no collisions and leaves legal moves after eating the apple."
