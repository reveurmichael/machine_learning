========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this classic Snake game problem. The snake starts at (5,5) and needs to reach an apple at (5,6). Let me figure out the best path.

First, the snake can't reverse direction on its first move because that's against the rules. So if it's moving UP or DOWN initially, next time it can't go the opposite way. But in this case, since the head is already at (5,5), and the apple is directly to the right at (5,6), I think moving RIGHT would be the straightforward approach.

But wait, when the snake moves RIGHT once, its head will be at (6,5). The body segments behind will follow. Since it hasn't eaten anything yet, there's no growth in the body. So after each move, the snake just slides forward.

I should also make sure that moving RIGHT doesn't cause any collisions with itself or the walls. Looking at the coordinate system, x ranges from 0 to 9 and y does too. Moving right once will take it from (5,5) to (6,5). Since there's no body in between, this seems safe.

After each move, I'll check if any part of the snake hits itself or goes out of bounds. But since it's moving from the middle towards the right and not hugging the walls unnecessarily, collisions shouldn't be an issue here.

Also, after eating the apple, which is at (5,6), the snake should have enough moves left to avoid traps. So I need to ensure that there are still valid directions to move in case it gets stuck later on.

Putting this all together, moving RIGHT once seems like the safe and efficient path for the snake to reach the apple.

{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving right is the optimal path since it directly moves towards the apple at (5,6). The head can move from (5,5) to (6,5), then proceed upwards if necessary without reversing direction immediately."
}
