You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (7,9), and the apple is at (8,9). The current direction is RIGHT, and the body has one segment at (6,9). So the snake is currently moving to the right. Let me think about the movement steps.

First, the snake is already facing RIGHT. The apple is just one cell to the right of the head. But wait, the body is at (6,9), which is directly behind the head. If the snake moves RIGHT again, the new head would be at (8,9), which is the apple's position. Let me check the collision rules here.

When moving, the new head is calculated. If the direction is RIGHT, the new head is (7+1,9) = (8,9). Now, check for collisions. The body cells are [(6,9)]. The new head is at (8,9). The current body segments are (6,9) and the head is at (7,9). So, the new head (8,9) is not overlapping with any body segment except possibly the tail. But since the body length is 1, the tail is (6,9). When moving, the body will shift. Let me go through the movement steps.

Step 1: Compute new head. Moving RIGHT gives (8,9). 

Step 2: Check collisions. The new head is (8,9). The existing body is [(6,9)]. The head is at (7,9). So, (8,9) is not overlapping with any body segment. The apple is there, so that's okay.

Step 3: Update body. Since the new head is at the apple's position, the snake grows. So, the body list is updated by inserting the old head (7,9) at the front. The original body was [(6,9)], so inserting (7,9) gives [(7,9), (6,9)]. Since the snake ate the apple, the tail isn't removed. So the body becomes [(7,9), (6,9)]. Then the head is updated to (8,9). So the new snake is [(8,9) head, (7,9), (6,9)].

After eating the apple, the next move must allow at least one legal move. Let's see. After eating, the body is two segments. The next move can't be LEFT, because that would reverse direction (current direction is RIGHT, so next can't be LEFT). Wait, the current direction is RIGHT, and after moving RIGHT again, the new direction is still RIGHT. Wait, but the movement is determined by the direction chosen. Wait, the initial direction is RIGHT. The first move is RIGHT again. Then, the next move can't be LEFT, because that's reversing. But after eating the apple, the snake's direction is still RIGHT. So the next move can't be LEFT. However, the next move can be UP or DOWN, or RIGHT again.

But after moving to (8,9), the snake's body is [(7,9), (6,9)]. Now, the head is at (8,9). The next move options: can't reverse direction (if the previous move was RIGHT, next can't be LEFT). So, possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Let's see. If the snake moves RIGHT again, the new head would be at (9,9). Then check for collisions. The body is [(7,9), (6,9)]. The new head is (9,9). No collision. Then the body would be updated by adding the old head (8,9) to the front, and since the apple isn't eaten again, the tail is removed. So the body becomes [(8,9), (7,9)], and the tail is (6,9) removed. So that's okay. But that's a possible path.

But the immediate problem is, the first move. Since the head is at (7,9), and the apple is at (8,9), moving RIGHT would take the head directly to the apple. That seems safe. But wait, the body is at (6,9). When moving to (8,9), the body is [(7,9), (6,9)] after the first move. But the head is at (8,9). The next move can't be LEFT, but that's okay. So the first move is RIGHT, which would reach the apple in one step. That seems possible. But why would there be any problem?

Wait, but the body's current position is [(6,9)]. Let me check the collision again. When moving RIGHT, the new head is (8,9). The body cells are [(6,9)], and the head is at (7,9). So the new head (8,9) is not overlapping with any body segments. Because the body is (6,9) and the head is (7,9). So (8,9) is not in the body. Therefore, the move is valid. So the snake can just move RIGHT once to get to the apple.

But the body is [(6,9)], and the head is (7,9). When the snake moves RIGHT to (8,9), the body is updated by inserting the old head (7,9) at the front. So the body becomes [(7,9), (6,9)], and since the apple was eaten, the tail is not removed. So the body is now two segments. So the new snake is head at (8,9), body at [(7,9), (6,9)].

After that, the next move must be possible. For example, moving UP or DOWN, or RIGHT again. So the snake is safe. Therefore, the moves would be ["RIGHT"], and that's it. But wait, the problem says that after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn. In this case, after moving RIGHT once, the next move can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. So that's okay.

So why isn't this the correct answer? The initial thought is that moving directly to the apple is possible. Let me recheck the collision check. The movement step says that if the new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies. In this case, the body is [(6,9)]. The new head is (8,9). None of the body cells are at (8,9), so no collision. Therefore, the move is valid. So the answer is just ["RIGHT"].

But why is the body provided as [(6,9)]? Because the snake's body is one segment. So the full snake is [head (7,9), (6,9)]. When moving right, the new head is (8,9). The body is updated to insert the old head (7,9) at the front, making the body [(7,9), (6,9)], and since the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed. Therefore, the body has two segments. So the snake is now two segments long. That's okay.

So the moves should be ["RIGHT"], and the reasoning is that moving directly to the apple is possible without collision. But let me make sure there's no other consideration. For example, the current direction is RIGHT, so moving RIGHT again is allowed (no reversal). The next move after eating the apple is possible. Therefore, the correct answer is to move RIGHT once.

{
"moves": ["RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly to the right of the head. Moving RIGHT immediately reaches the apple without collision, as the body segment is behind and does not block the path. After eating, the snake can continue moving safely."
}

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 9) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 9)], to eat the apple at (8, 9).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
