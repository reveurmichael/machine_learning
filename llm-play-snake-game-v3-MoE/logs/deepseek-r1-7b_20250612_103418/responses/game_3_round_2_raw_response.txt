========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get from (1,7) to (0,7). The snake is currently at (1,7), and the apple is directly to the left of it at (0,7). But there are some rules I need to follow.

First, I can't move right because that's where the body is. So my options are up, down, left, or none. Since moving left would take me into the body immediately, which is not allowed unless I'm eating the apple, but I haven't eaten anything yet. Wait, noâ€”actually, if I move left and then eat the apple, does that help? Hmm.

Wait, when you move left from (1,7), your new head position would be (0,7), which is where the apple is. So in one step, moving left to (0,7) would make me eat the apple because my new head is at the apple's location. But wait, I need to check if that move is valid.

Let me think: when you choose direction "LEFT", your new head becomes (1-1, 7) = (0,7). Now, before updating the body, we have to check for collisions. The current body doesn't include any cell except the head and behind it. Since I'm moving into the apple's position, which is empty right now, that seems okay.

But after moving, do I eat the apple? Yes, because the new head is at (0,7), so my score increases by 1, and since I ate the apple, I don't remove the tail. So the body stays as it was minus the old head being added at the front.

So the initial move would be "LEFT". Then after that, do I have to make any other moves? No, because I've reached the apple. Wait, but what about the snake's body and movement rules?

Wait, the snake is length 1 here because the body list is empty. So moving left from (1,7) would take me to (0,7), which is exactly where the apple is. That should be allowed.

But let me double-check the movement steps:

1. Compute new head: (0,7).
2. Check collisions: since it's the first move and no body segments except maybe when eating.
3. Update body: add old head at front; then if not eating, remove tail. But I'm eating the apple here, so I don't remove the tail.

So the new snake would be [(0,7), ...], but wait, since it's moving left from (1,7), the new head is (0,7). Since there was no body before, after adding old head at front and not removing anything because of eating, does that mean the body becomes empty again? Or do I have to add something?

Wait, according to the rules:

- When you eat the apple, you grow. So if your snake is length 1 (body list empty), moving left would make it [(0,7)], and then since it's growing, you don't remove the tail because you ate the apple.

So after this move, the snake should be at (0,7) as head with no body segments beyond that. That seems fine.

But wait, according to the example given earlier, when eating an apple, if the snake was length 1 before moving, it would grow by one? Or does growing refer to adding a new segment because you ate the apple?

Yes, because in the movement example where the snake is of length 3 and eats the apple, the body doesn't remove the tail. So here, since we're starting with length 1 (body list empty), moving into the apple would result in the head being at (0,7) without any body beyond that.

So I think "LEFT" is a valid first move because it gets me to where I need to be, and there are no collisions. Then, after that, if needed, I can make more moves, but since I've reached the apple, maybe only one move is required.

To navigate from (1,7) to (0,7), the shortest path involves moving left once.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving left directly reaches the apple's position at (0,7). This avoids any potential collisions and adheres to the movement rules."
}
```
