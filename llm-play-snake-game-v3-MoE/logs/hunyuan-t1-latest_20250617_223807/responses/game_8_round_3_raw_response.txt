========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,1) with a vertical body blocking direct upward movement. Moving RIGHT first avoids collision with the body and walls. Subsequent UP moves navigate around the body, a LEFT move creates space, and continued UP moves reach the apple. After eating, the snake can still move UP safely, ensuring no immediate trapping."
