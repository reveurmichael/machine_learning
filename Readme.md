## Project

### Forming groups

Each group 3 students.

Forming groups:
- https://docs.qq.com/doc/DT2xqVHphanhGUWpR

At most ONE group could have 2 or 4 students, provided that `N_Student % 3 != 0`.


### Get inspired
Streamlit Gallery etc.

### Implementation

Your machine learning application can be based on streamlit, flask, next.js or any other framework. It should be deployed on the cloud (Tencent/Alibaba/Google/Microsoft Cloud).

You can use chatgpt or gpt4, if you have the API key.

You can use AI APIs from Baidu/Tencent/Alibaba/Amazon/Google etc., for example:
- https://cloud.tencent.com/product/ocr-catalog
- https://cloud.tencent.com/product/ai-class

Apply for a domain name if necessary, e.g. [http://an-interesting-ml-app.com](http://an-interesting-ml-app.com).

As an alternative, a WeChat miniprogram is OK as well.


### What's expected of your video
- Length of video \>= 20 min
- You video should include those contents:
    - General presentation
    - How to use your ML Web app
    - How did you implement your app
    - How did you deploy your app
    - What's the task of each team member
    - Give an estimated workload/contribution percentage of each team member (Mandatory)
- If possible, make it fun. 
- If possible, make it fancy. 
- If applicable, include an ethics anylisis in your video.
- If applicable, include an market anylisis in your video.
- If applicable, include an ecology anylisis in your video.


### Submission of your work

Upload the zip file containing your code and video on your own Google Drive, send the sharing link to the prof, by PRIVATE WeChat or by Email. Therefore, no attached files, just an URL.

### For best projects
- Best projects might be hosted on [http://lunde.top](http://lunde.top), to inspire future projects.
- Best projects' videos will be included on Lunde Chen's bilibili channel.
- Lunde Chen might invite you to participate in innovation competitions with your projects.

### Last but not least
You app should be legal, ethical.

## Score

Denoting your Continuous assessment score as `T`, your project score as `P`,
you final score will be 

```python
max(P, 0.4 * T + 0.6 * P)
```

The average of all `T`s of all students will be equal to the average of all `P`s.

### Distribution
- 10% A (90-100)
- 10% A- (85-89)
- 10% B (80-84)
- 10% C (75-79)
etc.

## Asking questions :question:

### Leveraging **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)** for asking questions
By default, you should ask questions via **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)**. Here is how:
- https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1364y1h7sb/

### Principe
Here is the principle for asking questions:

>  **Google First, Peers Second, Profs Last.**

You are expected to ask questions via **[Gitee Issue](https://gitee.com/lundechen/cpp/issues)**. However, as a **secondary**  (and hence, less desirable, less encouraged) choice, you could also ask questions in the WeChat group.

> Why Gitee Issue? Because it's simply more **professional**, and better in every sense.

In Gitee Issue and the WeChat group, questions will be answered selectively. 

Questions won't be answered if:
- they could be solved on a simple Google search
- they are out of the scope of the course
- they are well in advance of the progress of the course
- professors think that it's not interesting for discussion

### Regarding personal WeChat chats:
- **Questions asked in personal WeChat chats will NOT be answered.**

Learning how to use Google & Baidu & Bing to solve computer science problems is an important skill you should develop during this course.

For private questions, please send your questions by email to:
- lundechen@shu.edu.cn (Lunde Chen)

### Office visit

Office visit is NOT welcome unless you make an appointment at least one day in advance.
