========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the current game state to plan a safe path for the snake's head at (8, 8) to reach the apple at (8, 4). Here’s how I’ll proceed:

### Current State:
- Head position: (8, 8)
- Direction: UP
- Body cells: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)]
- Apple position: (8, 4)

### Objective:
Move from head position (8, 8) to the apple at (8, 4).

### Constraints and Rules:
1. Cannot reverse direction immediately if current direction is UP.
2. The snake cannot move outside grid bounds or collide with its own body.
3. After eating the apple, ensure there's at least one legal move available.

### Path Planning:

Let’s break down the movements from (8, 8) to (8, 4):
- Since the y-coordinates are different and we need to move DOWN from (8, 8), I'll plan the moves accordingly.
- We can only go DOWN because the snake is already facing UP.

### Movement Plan:
1. Move DOWN once: (8, 7)
2. Move DOWN again: (8, 6)
3. Move DOWN once more: (8, 5)
4. Finally, move DOWN to reach apple: (8, 4)

This sequence ensures we avoid collisions with the body and stay within bounds.

### Final Plan:
The moves will be DOWN four times:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move directly DOWN from current position to reach apple at (8,4)."
}
```

Let’s verify the plan:
- Initial Position: (8, 8)
- After 1st DOWN: (8, 7)
- After 2nd DOWN: (8, 6)
- After 3rd DOWN: (8, 5)
- Final move to apple: (8, 4)

The number of DOWN moves is exactly equal to the difference in y-coordinates: 8 - 4 = 4. We've also ensured no collisions with walls or body.

So, here’s the JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move directly DOWN from current position to reach apple at (8,4)."
}
```
