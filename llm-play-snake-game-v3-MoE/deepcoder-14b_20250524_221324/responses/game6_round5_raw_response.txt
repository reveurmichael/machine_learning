<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (7,3) to the apple at (2,7). Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll note the current position of the head is (7,3), and the apple is at (2,7). The grid is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. My goal is to plan a safe path for the snake's head to reach the apple without causing any collisions.

The current direction of the snake is "DOWN". That means if I don't change direction right away, the next move would be down. But since I want to go towards the apple, which is at (2,7), I need to figure out the best way to get there.

Looking at the coordinates, the head is at x=7 and y=3. The apple is at x=2 and y=7. So, the snake needs to move left 5 units (since 7-2=5) in the x-direction and up 4 units (since 7-3=4) in the y-direction.

The movement rules say that each move can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is "DOWN", I can't go "UP" next. So my options are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or stay "NONE". But since the snake is currently moving down, and I want to head left and up, maybe a good first move would be to change direction in a way that allows me to start heading towards the apple.

Wait, no—since the current direction is "DOWN", I can't go "UP" next. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. But going further down from (7,3) might not be helpful since the apple is above and to the left. Maybe it's better to change direction early.

Wait, but the first move can't reverse. Since current is DOWN, I can choose any except UP. So maybe my first move should be LEFT or RIGHT. But looking at where the snake is, moving right might not help because that would take me further away from the apple's x-coordinate (which is 2). Moving left would decrease the x-coordinate towards 2.

But wait, the current direction is DOWN, and if I choose LEFT as my first move, that should be allowed. So maybe starting with LEFT makes sense to start moving towards the apple's x position.

Wait, but let me think about the body segments. The body cells are given as an empty list, so the snake is only the head right now? Or does it have a body? Wait no—the problem says that the body cells exclude the head and go from BODY1 to BODYN, which in this case is empty, meaning the snake's length is 1 (just the head). So I don't have any body segments to worry about except for possible collision with the tail when it moves.

Wait no—if the body list is empty, that means the snake has only the head and no body. So when moving, there are no body parts behind the head, so collisions with the body aren't an issue unless I'm growing after eating the apple.

So in this case, since the snake's body is just the head (since body cells are empty), I can move freely without worrying about the body blocking me, except for when I eat the apple and grow longer.

Wait no—the movement rules say that if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies. But since the body is empty, there are noBODYi to collide with except maybe after growing.

So for the initial moves, I can focus on getting the head towards the apple without worrying about the body blocking me.

But wait, the problem says that the current direction is "DOWN", and the movement's first step is computing new_head based on the current direction. Wait no—the movement is determined by the direction chosen each turn. So if the snake was moving in a certain direction previously, but I can choose any valid next move except reversing.

Wait no—wait, the movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction. If the current direction is "DOWN", then the next move can't be "UP". But if the current direction is "NONE" (which it isn't here), any first move is allowed. So in this case, since the current direction is "DOWN", my options for the first move are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Wait no—the movement rules say that you cannot reverse: e.g., if current is UP, next can't be DOWN; same for LEFT and RIGHT. But in our case, current is DOWN, so I can choose any direction except UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue with DOWN.

But since the apple is to the left (x=2) and up (y=7), maybe it's better to start moving LEFT to decrease x towards 2, but also need to move UP in y-direction.

Wait, let me think about the path. The head is at (7,3). To reach (2,7), I need to go left 5 times and up 4 times. So a possible minimal path would be moving LEFT five times and then UP four times, but that's 9 moves. But perhaps there's a more efficient way.

But wait, the snake can't just move in one direction all the time because it might get stuck or collide with its own body after growing. Since initially, the body is empty, I don't have to worry about that yet.

Wait no—the initial body is empty, so when I start moving, my body will grow as I eat apples or just by moving normally. Wait no—if the body cells are empty, then the snake's length is 1 (just the head). So when I make a move, if I don't eat an apple, the tail doesn't move because there's nothing to remove.

Wait no—the movement update rules say that if new_head != apple position, you remove the last element of BODY. But since initially, the body is empty, after moving, the old head (before the move) would be added to the body list as the first element, and then since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (which in this case would be nothing because the body is empty). Wait no—the initial body is empty. So when you insert the old head into the body list, it becomes [old_head], and then if you didn't eat the apple, you remove the last element of the body, which is... wait, but the body was empty before.

Wait, let's clarify:

Initial state:
HEAD: (7,3)
BODY: [] (empty)

First move: choose LEFT. Compute new_head as (6,3). Then, since new_head isn't the apple (which is at (2,7)), we proceed to update the body.

Step 3a: Insert old head (7,3) into front of BODY → BODY becomes [(7,3)].
Step 3b: Since not eating apple, remove last element of BODY. But the body was just [ (7,3) ], so after removing last, it's empty again. So the new S is HEAD at (6,3), BODY remains empty.

Wait no—the body list in step 3a becomes [(7,3)] because we inserted the old head into the front of the existing body list, which was empty. Then, since not eating apple, we remove the last element (which is (7,3)), so the new body list is empty again. So after moving LEFT, the snake's body is just the new head at (6,3), and no body segments.

Wait that can't be right because in the movement example given, when the snake had a body and moved, the old head was added to the front of the body, and then if not eating apple, the tail was removed. So in this case, with an empty body, after inserting the old head, the body is [ (7,3) ], and then we remove the last element (which is (7,3)), so the new body list becomes empty again.

Wait that seems a bit odd, but I think that's how it works. So each move without eating apple would result in the body being just the previous head added and then removed immediately, meaning no growth unless you eat an apple.

So for initial moves, as long as I'm not eating apples, my body remains empty or grows only when I eat.

But wait, initially, the snake's length is 1 (head only). When I make a move without eating, the body would have the old head added and then removed, so the body stays at zero. Wait no—let me think again.

Wait, the initial body list is empty. So when I make a move:

- new_head = (6,3) after choosing LEFT.
- Check for collision: since body is empty, no collision except if new_head is out of bounds or hits any BODYi (which it doesn't because body is empty).
- Then, step 3a: insert old head (7,3) into the front of the body list → body becomes [ (7,3) ].
- Since not eating apple, step 3c: remove last element of body. But the body now has one element, which is (7,3). So after removal, the body is empty again.

So the new state would be:
HEAD = (6,3)
BODY = []

Wait that can't be right because then each move without eating apple would just reset the body to empty, but that's not how snakes grow. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the rules.

Wait no—the movement update step says:

If new_head != apple position (step 3b: grow) → else, step 3c: remove last element of BODY.

So in this case, since we didn't eat the apple, we do step 3c: remove last element. But after inserting old head into the front, the body is [ (7,3) ] because it was empty before. Then removing the last element would leave the body as empty again.

Wait that can't be right—because then each move without eating apple would just add and then immediately remove the previous head, so the snake's body remains at length 1 only when you eat an apple.

But in reality, when a snake moves, it leaves a trail behind, which implies that each segment follows. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules.

Wait looking back: step 3a says insert old_head into front of BODY list → new_body = [old_head] + body_list.

Then, if you didn't eat apple (step 3c), remove last element → new_body = new_body[:-1].

So in our case:

Initial body is empty.
After inserting old head: new_body = [ (7,3) ] + [] = [ (7,3) ]
If not eating apple, remove last element → new_body = [ (7,3) ][:-1] → which is empty.

Wait that would mean the body list remains empty after each non-eating move. That can't be right because then the snake's body never grows unless it eats an apple.

But in reality, when a snake moves, each segment follows, so the body should grow by one segment if you don't eat anything? Or maybe not—perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait no—the rules say:

If new_head != apple position → step 3c: remove last element of BODY. So in this case, after inserting old head into front (making body [old_head]), then removing the last element would leave an empty list again.

So for each move without eating, the body remains as it was before plus adding the old head and then immediately removing it. That seems odd, but perhaps that's how it's designed.

Wait no—that can't be right because if you keep moving without eating apples, your body would just oscillate between empty and one segment, which doesn't make sense for a snake.

I think I must have misread the rules. Let me recheck:

Movement Update Rules:

After computing new_head,

3a: new_body = [old_head] + body_list

If you ate apple (new_head == apple position):

   3b: since you grow, don't remove anything → new_body remains as new_body.

Else:

   3c: new_body = new_body[:-1]

So in our initial case:

HEAD is at (7,3), BODY is empty.

First move: choose LEFT → new_head is (6,3).

Since not eating apple (assuming no apple at (6,3)), proceed to step 3c.

new_body after 3a: [ (7,3) ] + [] = [ (7,3) ]

Then step 3c: remove last element → new_body becomes empty again.

So the new state is:

HEAD: (6,3)

BODY: []

Wait that can't be right because then each move without eating would just leave the body as it was before. So if I make multiple moves without eating apples, my body remains empty or only temporarily has a segment.

This suggests that the snake's body only grows when it eats an apple; otherwise, it doesn't gain any segments. That makes sense in some contexts (like games where you only grow when you eat food), so perhaps this is intended.

So with that in mind, for initial moves, I don't have to worry about the body blocking me because it's empty or just one segment added and then removed unless I eat an apple.

Therefore, my main concern is moving towards the apple without reversing direction in a way that would cause immediate collision (though since the body is empty initially, that's not a problem).

So let's plan the path:

The head needs to move from (7,3) to (2,7). So x decreases by 5 and y increases by 4.

Possible paths:

Option 1: Move LEFT five times, then UP four times. Total of 9 moves.

But this might not be efficient in terms of the number of steps, but since we're just planning a safe path, that's acceptable as long as there are no obstacles (which there aren't in this scenario).

Wait but I have to consider that after each move without eating an apple, my body remains empty or just briefly has a segment. So collisions with the body won't happen until I start growing.

But wait, when I eat an apple, I grow by adding the new head and not removing the last element, so the body increases in length.

So perhaps after the first few moves, once I've eaten an apple (if any are present), my body will start to have segments that could block me if I'm not careful.

But in this problem, it's just about moving the head towards the apple without causing collisions. Since there are no other obstacles mentioned, perhaps a direct path is acceptable.

Wait but wait—there might be an issue with turning direction after certain points. For example, if I go all the way left first and then up, I have to make sure that when I change direction from LEFT to UP, it's allowed (i.e., not reversing). Wait no—if I'm moving LEFT and then decide to move UP, is that allowed?

Wait no—the movement rules say you can't reverse. So if your current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT, but could be UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

Wait no—current direction is what determines the possible next moves. Wait no: the problem says that each turn, the direction chosen must not be the reverse of the previous direction. So for example:

- If current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT.
- If current is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT.
- Similarly, UP and DOWN are reverses.

Wait wait—the movement rules say: "You cannot change direction to a reverse direction (e.g., if you were moving north, you cannot suddenly change to south)."

So in our case:

If the current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT.

Similarly, if current is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT.

Same for UP and DOWN.

But what about other directions? For example, if current is LEFT, can I switch to UP or DOWN?

Yes, because those are not reverse directions. Only the opposite cardinal directions are considered reverses.

So in this case, after moving LEFT a few times, I could change direction to UP without any issues.

Wait no—wait: the movement rules say:

"You cannot change direction to a reverse direction (e.g., if you were moving north, you cannot suddenly change to south)."

So for example:

- If current is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT.
- If current is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT.
- If current is UP, next can't be DOWN.
- If current is DOWN, next can't be UP.

But if the current direction is LEFT, I can change to UP or DOWN as those are not reverse directions. Similarly, if current is UP, I can change to LEFT or RIGHT, etc.

Wait no, wait: when you're moving in a certain direction (like LEFT), your possible next moves are any except the opposite (RIGHT). So from LEFT, you can go LEFT again, UP, DOWN, but not RIGHT.

So that's important because it affects how I plan my path.

In our initial scenario:

Current direction is DOWN. So for the first move, I can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or continue with DOWN. But since I want to reach (2,7), which is LEFT and UP, perhaps choosing LEFT as the next move would be better than continuing down.

Wait but let's think about it step by step:

First move options:

- Current direction: DOWN
Possible next directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue with DOWN.

If I choose LEFT as my first move, then new_head is (6,3). Then, for the second move, since current was LEFT, I can't go RIGHT. So possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

Wait no—the movement rules say you can't reverse, which in this case would be if current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT; but you can choose any other direction, including UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

So after moving LEFT once (from DOWN), the new current direction becomes LEFT. Then, for the second move, I can choose LEFT again, or UP, or DOWN, but not RIGHT.

But my goal is to reach x=2 and y=7, so perhaps it's better to keep moving left until I reach x=2, then change direction to UP and start moving up until y=7.

So the first few moves would be:

1. Move LEFT (from current DOWN) → new_head at (6,3), direction now LEFT.
2. Next move: continue LEFT → (5,3)
3. Next: LEFT → (4,3)
4. Next: LEFT → (3,3)
5. Next: LEFT → (2,3)

Now I'm at x=2, y=3. Now I need to move up 4 times.

But wait, I have to make sure that when I change direction from LEFT to UP, it's allowed. Since current direction is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT; but UP and DOWN are allowed.

So after step 5 (reaching x=2), I can choose UP as the next move:

6. Move UP → (2,4)
7. Move UP → (2,5)
8. Move UP → (2,6)
9. Move UP → (2,7)

That's a total of 9 moves.

But wait, let me check if this path is possible without causing any collisions with the body.

Since initially, the body is empty, and each move without eating an apple doesn't add to the body (as per earlier confusion), perhaps there are no body parts to collide with. But I'm not entirely sure about that; maybe after a few moves, the body starts to have segments that could block the path.

Wait no—since in this scenario, we're only considering moving towards the apple without any other food sources, and assuming no apples except at (2,7), which is our target. So until we reach (2,7), we won't be growing unless there's an apple along the way.

But since the problem doesn't mention any other apples or obstacles, perhaps I can assume that once I reach (2,7), I'll eat it and grow, but before that, my body remains empty or only briefly has a segment that doesn't block me.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since there are no obstacles mentioned, the direct path should be fine as long as I don't reverse direction in a way that would cause immediate collision with myself (which isn't possible here since the body is empty until I eat an apple).

Wait but wait—when I start moving up after reaching x=2, my body might have segments from previous moves. Let me think about this.

After move 5: I'm at (2,3). My body would be:

Each time I move without eating, the body is added as [old_head] and then immediately removed in step 3c, so after each non-eating move, the body list becomes empty again. Wait no—each move adds the old head to the front of the body list, but then removes the last element if not eating.

Wait let's simulate:

Move 1: Direction LEFT from DOWN (current direction was DOWN). So:

- Old_head = (7,3)
- new_head = (6,3)
- Since no apple eaten, step 3c: new_body = [old_head] + body_list → [(7,3)] + [] = [(7,3)]
Then remove last element → new_body is empty.

So after move 1:

HEAD: (6,3), BODY: []

Move 2: Direction LEFT again (current direction now LEFT).

- Old_head = (6,3)
- new_head = (5,3)
- No apple eaten.
- new_body after step 3a: [old_head] + body_list → [(6,3)] + [] = [(6,3)]
- Then step 3c: remove last element → new_body is empty.

So HEAD: (5,3), BODY: []

Similarly, moves 3 and 4:

Move 3: LEFT to (4,3).BODY remains empty.
Move 4: LEFT to (3,3).BODY remains empty.
Move 5: LEFT to (2,3).BODY remains empty.

Now, move 6: Direction UP.

Current direction is LEFT. Next direction can be UP (not reverse), so allowed.

- Old_head = (2,3)
- new_head = (2,4)
- No apple eaten yet.
- new_body after step 3a: [old_head] + body_list → [(2,3)] + [] = [(2,3)]
- Then step 3c: remove last element → new_body is empty.

So HEAD: (2,4), BODY: []

Similarly for moves 7,8,9:

Move 7: UP to (2,5).BODY remains empty.
Move 8: UP to (2,6).BODY remains empty.
Move 9: UP to (2,7). Now, assuming there's an apple here.

Wait wait—the problem says "You are the head of a snake. You need to find the way out of the maze." But in this scenario, I'm just moving towards a point; perhaps the exit is at (2,7). So upon reaching (2,7), I eat the apple and grow.

So after move 9:

- new_head = (2,7)
- Assuming that's where the exit/food is, so we eat it.
- Therefore, step 3b applies: don't remove last element. So new_body becomes [old_head] + body_list → [(2,6)] (since old_head was (2,6) before moving UP to (2,7)).

Wait wait—no:

Wait when you move from (2,6) to (2,7):

- old_head is (2,6)
- new_head is (2,7)

Assuming that's where the apple/exit is, so we eat it. Therefore:

new_body after step 3a: [old_head] + body_list → [(2,6)] + [] = [(2,6)]

Since we ate the apple, step 3b applies: don't remove anything. So new_body remains as [(2,6)], and the head is now at (2,7).

Wait that doesn't seem right. The body should include all segments up to the old head.

Wait no—the body list before this move was empty because after each non-eating move, it's emptied. So when you eat an apple, the new_body would be [old_head] + previous_body (which was empty) → [ (2,6) ].

Then since we ate, step 3b: new_body remains as [ (2,6) ], and the head is now at (2,7). So the body is now [ (2,6) ].

Wait that seems off. Normally, when a snake eats, it grows by adding the new head without removing the last segment. So in this case:

Before eating:

- Head: (2,6)
- Body: empty

After moving UP to (2,7), if there's an apple there:

- old_head = (2,6)
- new_head = (2,7)

Step 3a: new_body = [old_head] + body_list → [(2,6)] + [] = [(2,6)]

Since we ate the apple, step 3b: new_body remains as is.

So now:

Head: (2,7)
Body: [ (2,6) ]

Wait that seems like only one segment. But in reality, a snake's body would have all the previous segments leading up to the old head. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body list is maintained.

Alternatively, perhaps each time you move and don't eat, the body grows by adding the new head and removing the last tail, keeping the length constant (if not growing). But when you eat, you add the new head without removing the tail, thus increasing the length.

But in our case, since we started with an empty body and only ate once at the end, the body would be [ (2,6) ] after eating.

Wait that still seems like a very short snake. Maybe I'm missing something in how the body list is updated.

Alternatively, perhaps each move adds the new head to the front of the body list, but if you don't eat, you remove the last element, keeping the body length the same as before (if any). If you do eat, you add the new head without removing anything, thus increasing the body length by one.

So in our case:

After move 1: HEAD (6,3), BODY empty.
After move 2: HEAD (5,3), BODY empty.
...
After move 5: HEAD (2,3), BODY empty.

Move 6: Direction UP from LEFT → allowed.
- old_head = (2,3)
- new_head = (2,4)
- No apple eaten yet, so:
   - new_body after step 3a: [old_head] + body_list → [(2,3)] + [] = [(2,3)]
   - then step 3c: remove last element → new_body is empty.

So HEAD (2,4), BODY empty.

Similarly for moves 7 and 8:

Move 7: UP to (2,5).BODY remains empty.
Move 8: UP to (2,6).BODY remains empty.

Move 9: UP to (2,7).

Assuming there's an apple here:

- old_head = (2,6)
- new_head = (2,7)
- Step 3a: new_body = [old_head] + body_list → [(2,6)] + [] = [(2,6)]
- Since we ate, step 3b: don't remove anything. So new_body remains [(2,6)].

So now:

HEAD: (2,7)
BODY: [ (2,6) ]

Wait that's just the head and one segment below it at (2,6). If I were to move further up from here, say UP again, what would happen?

- Current direction is UP.
- Next move can't be DOWN (since that's reverse).
- So possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

But our target is already reached, so perhaps we're done.

Wait no—the problem says "find the way out of the maze." I'm assuming that reaching (2,7) is the exit. So once there, we're done.

So in this case, the path would be:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. LEFT
6. UP
7. UP
8. UP
9. UP

Each move without reversing the previous direction.

But wait—after the first move (LEFT), current direction becomes LEFT. Then, after moving LEFT again, current remains LEFT. Only when I change direction to UP does the current direction update to UP.

So overall, this path is valid as it doesn't involve any reverse directions and reaches the target in 9 moves.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more efficient path, but since we're only concerned with safety (no collisions) and not minimizing steps, this should work.

Another consideration: when changing direction from LEFT to UP at (2,3), is there any risk of hitting the body? But since the body was emptied after each non-eating move, except for the last one where we ate, but in this case, the only body segment would be [ (2,6) ] when we reach (2,7). Wait no—after eating at (2,7), the body is [ (2,6) ], so moving UP from there wouldn't cause a collision because the body is only at (2,6).

Wait but in move 9, after eating, the body is [ (2,6) ] and the head is at (2,7). If I were to move further UP (though we've already reached the exit), it's not necessary.

So yes, this path should work without any self-collisions as long as there are no other obstacles or apples along the way that would cause the body to grow earlier and potentially block the path.

Another possible route could be moving up earlier, but since the target is at (2,7), moving left first makes sense.

Wait wait—the problem statement isn't specific about the grid. I assumed a 2D grid where x decreases as we move left and increases as we move right, y increases as we go up. But perhaps the coordinates are different. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the coordinate system is standard.

Alternatively, maybe the snake starts at (7,3) and needs to get to (2,7), moving only LEFT and UP without reversing direction in a way that would cause collision.

Another point: when changing direction from LEFT to UP, the next moves are all UP. Since we're not reversing any direction, this shouldn't be a problem.

So in conclusion, the path is:

1. LEFT
2. LEFT
3. LEFT
4. LEFT
5. LEFT
6. UP
7. UP
8. UP
9. UP

This should safely navigate from (7,3) to (2,7) without any self-collisions, given that the body doesn't block the path until after we've reached the target and eaten.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an exit or food source in a maze. The snake can only move left or up, and it cannot reverse direction in a way that would cause it to collide with itself.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The snake starts at position (7,3) and needs to reach the target at (2,7). The snake can only move left or up, and each move must not cause the snake's body to intersect with its own path.
2. **Path Strategy**: Since the snake cannot reverse direction in a way that would lead to self-collision, we can plan a direct path by first moving left as much as needed to align horizontally with the target and then moving up vertically to reach the target.
3. **Direction Changes**: After moving left five times to reduce the x-coordinate from 7 to 2, the snake can then move up four times to increase the y-coordinate from 3 to 7 without any risk of collision.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the path for the snake to take.
path = [
    (7, 3),  # Starting position
    (6, 3),  # Move LEFT
    (5, 3),  # Move LEFT
    (4, 3),  # Move LEFT
    (3, 3),  # Move LEFT
    (2, 3),  # Move LEFT
    (2, 4),  # Move UP
    (2, 5),  # Move UP
    (2, 6),  # Move UP
    (2, 7)   # Move UP (Exit or food at this point)
]
```

### Explanation
1. **Starting Position**: The snake begins at (7,3).
2. **Horizontal Movement**: The snake moves left five times to reach (2,3). Each move updates the x-coordinate by decreasing it by 1.
3. **Vertical Movement**: Once aligned horizontally with the target, the snake then moves up four times to increase its y-coordinate from 3 to 7. This vertical movement ensures that it reaches the target without any risk of colliding with itself since there are no body segments blocking this path until after reaching the target.

This approach guarantees a safe and efficient route for the snake to reach its destination by avoiding any self-collisions through careful planning of direction changes.
