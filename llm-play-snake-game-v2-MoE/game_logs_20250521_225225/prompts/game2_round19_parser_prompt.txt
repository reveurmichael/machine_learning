BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake reach the apple without dying. The snake is currently at position (5,1) and moving LEFT. Its body has just one segment at (6,1), and the apple is at (5,2). 

First, let's visualize the grid. The snake's head is at (5,1), which is near the bottom edge since y=0 is the bottom-left corner and y=9 is top-right. The body is at (6,1), so one square to the right of the head. The apple is just one square above the head.

The snake can't reverse direction immediately because it's moving LEFT. So after this move, it will try to go further LEFT or maybe UP if possible. But wait, if it moves LEFT again, it would be going in the same direction as before, which might not violate rule 3 since "NONE" is allowed only once? Wait no, rule 3 says the snake can't reverse direction on the first move. So moving LEFT after already being at LEFT is okay because it's just a straight line.

Wait, but let me clarify: the current direction is LEFT. The next move cannot be RIGHT immediately. But since we're not changing direction yet, perhaps moving LEFT again would still keep it going in the same direction without reversing.

So starting with (5,1), moving LEFT to (4,1). Then next move could also be LEFT to (3,1). Wait, but that's heading away from the apple. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, actually, the snake can't reverse direction on the first move. So if it moves LEFT again, it's still going in the same general direction, which is allowed because rule 3 only prohibits immediate reversal when trying to change direction back.

But perhaps moving UP might be better since that will bring us closer to the apple at (5,2). Let me calculate the Manhattan distance: from (5,1) to (5,2), it's just one step up. But wait, we're currently moving LEFT, so our next move is LEFT unless we change direction.

Wait a minute, but the snake can't reverse on the first move. So if it moves LEFT again, that would be continuing in the same direction without reversing. Alternatively, maybe changing to UP after some steps could get us closer.

But since the apple is directly above the head by one cell, moving UP from (5,1) would take us straight there. However, we're currently facing LEFT, so moving UP isn't our initial direction. So perhaps we need to adjust our movement plan.

Wait, but according to rule 3, if the snake's current direction is LEFT, then on subsequent moves, it can still go LEFT or change direction as long as it doesn't reverse immediately. But in this case, maybe the optimal path would be to turn UP after some steps so that we move towards the apple.

But let's think about each step:

1. Current head: (5,1), moving LEFT.
2. Next move could be either LEFT or UP if possible without reversing.

If it moves LEFT again to (4,1), then on the next move, can it change direction to RIGHT? No, because that would mean a 180-degree turn from LEFT to RIGHT after two steps, which isn't allowed on the first move. Wait no: rule 3 says cannot reverse direction immediately. So if we're moving LEFT and then switch to RIGHT, is that considered reversing? Or just changing direction?

I think it's considered a reversal because it's changing from LEFT to RIGHT, which are opposite directions.

Wait, but maybe not on the first move. Let me re-read rule 3: "The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If the direction is 'NONE', any move is allowed."

So moving from LEFT to RIGHT would be a reversal because LEFT and RIGHT are opposites.

Wait no, perhaps it's not. Because LEFT and RIGHT are orthogonal directions but opposite in movement. But I think rule 3 refers to immediate reversal as in going back along the same line but opposite direction.

But let me consider that moving LEFT again is allowed since it's not a direct reverse from LEFT; just continuing straight.

Hmm, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. Maybe the snake cannot change direction abruptly by more than 90 degrees or something like that.

Wait, actually, perhaps the rule only prohibits immediate reversal in terms of being unable to move back along the same line in the opposite direction on the next step after moving in a certain direction.

So if the snake is moving LEFT, then the next move cannot be RIGHT. So it can continue LEFT or change directions like UP or DOWN but not RIGHT immediately.

Wait no, rule 3 says that when you're going UP, you cannot move DOWN next; same applies for other opposite directions. So if we are moving LEFT, perhaps we can't switch to RIGHT because they are in the same axis? Or maybe it's allowed as long as it's a different direction but not directly opposite.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of each possible direction after each move and see which path leads us closer to the apple without violating any rules.

So starting at (5,1), moving LEFT brings us to (4,1). Now, from there, can we change directions?

If we were to turn UP next, that would mean moving towards (4,0) but wait, y=0 is already on the bottom. Wait no: y decreases as you go up? Or does it increase? Let me clarify.

In grid coordinates, typically (x,y) where x increases to the right and y increases upwards, so in our case:

- Moving LEFT reduces x by 1.
- Moving RIGHT increases x by 1.
- Moving UP increases y by 1.
- Moving DOWN decreases y by 1.

Wait no: Wait, the user defined that (x,y) has (0,0) as bottom-left and (9,9) as top-right. So moving up would increase y towards 9, but down is decreasing y to lower values.

So in this grid:

- Moving UP increases y by 1.
- Moving DOWN decreases y by 1.
- Moving LEFT decreases x by 1.
- Moving RIGHT increases x by 1.

Now, the head is at (5,1), so moving LEFT takes it to (4,1). If from there we move UP to (4,2), that's one step towards the apple at (5,2). But how?

Alternatively, maybe after a series of moves, switching direction will allow us to get closer.

But let me think about what happens if the snake tries to turn right when it can. Let's consider all possible paths:

Option 1: Move LEFT twice.
- First move: (5,1) → (4,1)
- Second move: (4,1) → (3,1)

That moves us further away from the apple at (5,2). Not ideal.

Option 2: Move LEFT once, then UP:
- First move: (5,1) → (4,1)
- Then change direction to UP.
Wait, but can we change direction after moving LEFT?

From (5,1), direction is LEFT. Next possible moves cannot be RIGHT (reverse). So from there, next move options are either continue LEFT or switch to any other non-reversal direction.

So from (4,1), the snake can't go RIGHT, so it has to choose between going LEFT again, UP, or DOWN but not RIGHT.

Wait no: when you're moving LEFT and then change to another direction like UP, is that allowed? Or does rule 3 prohibit any reversal?

I think rule 3 prohibits only immediate reversals along the same line. So moving from LEFT in one step to another non-LEFT direction (like UP) would be acceptable.

So from (4,1), moving UP would take us to (4,2). Now, that's getting closer to (5,2).

But then, after that move, can we change direction again? Let me see:

From (4,2), where could the snake go?

If it moves RIGHT towards x=5: from 4→5. So moving RIGHT would take us to (5,2), which is our target.

Wait no: moving RIGHT increases x by 1. From (4,2), moving RIGHT brings us to (5,2). But that's the apple location! Perfect!

So let me check if this path works without any rule violations:

- Move LEFT → (4,1)
- Then move UP → (4,2) [allowed because previous direction was LEFT, so changing to UP is fine]
- Then move RIGHT → (5,2)

Now, we need to see the sequence of directions and whether any rule 3 issues arise.

But after moving LEFT once, then changing to UP, which is not a reversal, so it's allowed. Then from UP to RIGHT: is that considered a reversal?

Wait, movement direction changes from UP (which was an orthogonal change) to RIGHT. Are those considered reversals? Hmm, perhaps not because they are in different directions.

Alternatively, maybe the rule 3 applies only when moving along the same line but opposite direction. So moving from LEFT to RIGHT is a direct reversal on the x-axis, which would be prohibited by rule 3.

But in this case, we're changing from UP to RIGHT; these are orthogonal movements. So perhaps that's allowed because they aren't directly reverse directions.

So maybe after (5,1) → move LEFT to (4,1), then UP to (4,2), then RIGHT to (5,2). That would get us exactly where we need to go in three moves without violating any rules.

Wait: But from (4,2), moving RIGHT is allowed because the previous direction was UP. So that's acceptable as per rule 3.

But wait: let me check each step:

- Start at (5,1) facing LEFT.
- Move LEFT to (4,1): okay.
- Now facing LEFT again, but from here you change direction to UP. Is this allowed? Yes, because the previous movement was in a different axis; rule 3 only prohibits moving along the same line but opposite direction.

So after that, we can move RIGHT towards the target.

This seems like a viable path without any violations.

Alternatively, another possible path: Move DOWN first. Let me see:

- (5,1) → LEFT to (4,1)
- Then change to RIGHT? No, because you were facing LEFT and changing to RIGHT would be a direct reversal on the x-axis.
Wait no: from LEFT direction, moving RIGHT is prohibited only if it's directly opposite.

But in this case, movement changes direction but not along the same line. So perhaps that's allowed.

So let me think again:

After (5,1) → move LEFT to (4,1), then from there change direction to RIGHT? No: because moving RIGHT after being facing LEFT is a direct reversal on x-axis, which would violate rule 3.

Therefore, you can't do that. So the only allowed moves from (4,1) are either to continue LEFT or switch directions like UP or DOWN but not RIGHT.

Wait no: when direction was LEFT, next move options include any non-RIGHT movements because from LEFT, moving RIGHT is prohibited if it's a reversal along x-axis.

But in this case, we're switching to another axis (UP). So that should be allowed.

So after (4,1), the snake can either:

- Continue LEFT → (3,1)
- Switch to UP → (4,2)
- Switch to DOWN → (4,0) but since y cannot be less than 0? Wait, starting at y=1. So moving DOWN from (5,1): x remains same, y decreases by 1.

Wait in the first move, we moved LEFT to (4,1). From there:

- If you switch directions, like to UP → (4,2) or to DOWN → (4,0).

So perhaps another path is: after moving LEFT once and then switching to UP twice steps towards the target.

Alternatively, but let me think again. Wait in this scenario, from (5,1), first move LEFT, second move UP, third move RIGHT would reach the apple without any issues as per rule 3.

Wait but wait, from (4,2) moving RIGHT is a change from direction UP to RIGHT; that's allowed because it's not along the same line. So no problem with reversing rules here.

So in this case:

Moves: LEFT → UP → RIGHT

Which would take us from (5,1) to (4,1), then to (4,2), then to (5,2).

This seems like a valid path that doesn't violate any of the given rules.
</think>

The snake can first move LEFT once to reach (4,1), then move UP twice to get to (4,2), and finally move RIGHT once to arrive at (5,2) where the apple is located. This sequence adheres to all movement rules.

$\boxed{(5, 2)}$
