You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is currently at (5,5) and needs to reach the apple at (1,1). I need to plan a safe path for the snake to move without colliding with its own body or going out of bounds. 

First, let's understand the current state. The head is at (5,5), and the direction is NONE, meaning any initial move is allowed except reversing if there were a previous direction, but since it's NONE, all directions are possible. However, the movement rules say that once a direction is chosen, the next move can't be the opposite.

The apple is at (1,1). The Manhattan distance between (5,5) and (1,1) is 8, so we need a path that covers this distance efficiently while avoiding collisions with the body. Since the initial body is empty, we don't have to worry about body segments blocking the way right now.

I think the optimal path would involve moving left four times and down four times. However, I need to ensure that each move doesn't reverse direction in a way that causes immediate collision or traps the snake.

Let me plan the moves:

1. Start by moving LEFT to reduce the x-coordinate. From (5,5) to (4,5).
2. Then, continue moving LEFT to (3,5), then (2,5), and finally (1,5). Now at (1,5), we need to move down four times.

Wait, but after each left move, the body grows if it's eating an apple. Oh wait, no, the apple is at (1,1), so when moving down from (1,5) to (1,4), etc., I have to ensure that the snake doesn't collide with its own body.

Wait, but in this case, the initial body is empty, so after each move, the body will just follow. So as long as the head moves towards the apple without reversing direction, it should be fine.

Let me outline the moves:

1. LEFT: (5,5) → (4,5)
2. LEFT: (4,5) → (3,5)
3. LEFT: (3,5) → (2,5)
4. LEFT: (2,5) → (1,5)
5. DOWN: (1,5) → (1,4)
6. DOWN: (1,4) → (1,3)
7. DOWN: (1,3) → (1,2)
8. DOWN: (1,2) → (1,1)

This path seems straightforward. Each move is a left followed by downs, ensuring the snake doesn't reverse direction and grows as it moves towards the apple.

Wait, but after each LEFT move, the direction changes from NONE to LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT. Since we're only moving LEFT four times and then DOWN four times without reversing, this should be safe.

I also need to check if after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move left. After reaching (1,1), the body will have grown, but since the moves end here, it's okay as the problem doesn't require further steps.

So, the sequence of moves would be four LEFTs and then four DOWNs.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move left four times to reach column 1, then move down four times to reach the apple at (1,1). This path avoids collisions and ensures each move is safe."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (1, 1).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
