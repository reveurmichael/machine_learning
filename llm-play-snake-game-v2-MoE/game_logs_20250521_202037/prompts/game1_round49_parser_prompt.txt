Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where my snake is at (3,6) facing up. The apple is at (9,1). My goal is to plan a safe path for the head to reach the apple without colliding with its body or walls. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand how the snake moves. Each move affects the head, and the tail only grows back if the apple is eaten. The snake can't reverse direction immediately; it has to maintain the same heading unless it's NONE. 

The current position of the snake includes some body parts: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). That means part of the snake is in that area. So when planning moves, I need to make sure that as the head moves, it doesn't bump into any of these body segments after moving.

The apple is at (9,1), so my target is there. The difference between the current position and the target is in both x and y directions. From (3,6) to (9,1): x increases by 6 and y decreases by 5. So I need more RIGHT moves than LEFTs by 6, and more DOWN moves than UPs by 5.

Given that the snake can't reverse direction immediately, my initial move has to be either RIGHT or something else but keeping in mind the constraints of not colliding with itself or going out of bounds.

Looking at the body cells, right now, (3,4) is part of the body. If I go UP from (3,6), that would take me to (3,7). But since (3,5) is already in the body, moving up might cause a collision when the head moves there.

Wait, no: when you move up once, your new head position is (3,7), but then the rest of the snake shifts down. So after that first move, the body would shift to [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]. Then moving from (3,6) to (3,7). But does (3,7) collide with any body part? The current head is at (3,6); after moving up, the new position would be (3,7). I need to check if that's in the body. Before moving, the body was [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]. So no collision there.

Wait, but when you move, the tail doesn't stay unless it eats the apple. So after each move, except for eating the apple, the tail is removed. So my new head position would be (3,7). Then I have to check if any of the body parts are at that position now.

Looking at the current body: [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]. The new head after moving up would be (3,7). So none of the body cells are there. Then I can safely move up to (3,7).

But wait, let me make sure about how the movement works. After each step:

1. New head = current head + direction.
2. Head becomes the new body segment.
3. Tail is removed unless apple is eaten.

So after moving up from (3,6) to (3,7), the snake's body would be [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)]. So no collision there because none of those positions are occupied by the other body segments except for shifting.

So moving UP first seems safe. Let me see how that plays out.

After that initial move to (3,7), I need to continue moving towards the apple while avoiding collisions with my own body.

Next moves would have to be in a direction that doesn't cause the snake to collide. Since we're at (3,7) and want to go rightwards because x is 3 and target is x=9, which is higher.

So from (3,7), moving RIGHT to (4,7). Now, check body segments: previous was [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)]. So the new head at (4,7) isn't in there. So safe.

Then next move: continue righting towards higher x. From (4,7) to (5,7). Check body again; none of these positions are occupied except for shifting.

But wait, as we keep moving right, our y is 7, which needs to decrease to reach y=1. So maybe after some point, I have to start moving down as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move up and then right alternately? But since the snake's body is in (3,4), if I go further up beyond that might cause issues later.

Wait, let me think about how each step affects the body. Each time we move, except when eating apple, the tail is removed. So after moving to (3,7), the next steps would be:

After first move: [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

Second move up from (3,7) would take us to (3,8). Then body becomes [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)].

Then third move: if I go up again to (3,9), but the grid is 0-9, so y=9 is allowed. Wait no, x and y are from 0 to 9? No, wait in the coordinate system, it's 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So y can be up to 9.

So moving up to (3,8), then again to (3,9). Then next move would have to avoid apple position? Or maybe after reaching the target x=9 and sufficient y, proceed down.

But wait, my target is (9,1). So from (3,6) I need to go right 6 steps in x-direction and down 5 in y. But moving up first may complicate this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move RIGHT as much as possible until reaching a certain point where I can start moving DOWN towards the apple.

But let me see: starting at (3,6), if I keep moving right:

From (3,6) -> Right to (4,6). Then again Right to (5,6), then 6 times to get x=9? Wait no, from 3 to 9 is 6 steps.

But wait the apple is at y=1. So once we are near enough in x-direction, we need to start moving down towards lower y.

So perhaps a path like this: move RIGHT until reaching x=8 (since target is x=9), then up to y=5, but I have to make sure not to collide with the body or walls.

Wait, let me outline possible steps:

1. Start at (3,6). Direction UP.
2. Move UP to (3,7).
3. Move RIGHT to (4,7).
4. Move RIGHT to (5,7).
5. Move RIGHT to (6,7).
6. Move RIGHT to (7,7).
7. Move RIGHT to (8,7).
8. Now at x=8, need to move right once more to reach x=9.

Wait, but from 3 to 9 is six steps in x-direction, so moving RIGHT six times would take us from x=3 to x=9.

But wait, starting at (3,6), after moving up first step, then right five more times? Let me count:

From initial position: move UP once (x=3,y=7). Then need to go 5 steps in x-direction and some in y-direction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to plan a path that goes around the body.

Wait another thought: moving up first could cause the snake to be near the top of the grid, which is allowed since (9,1) is at the bottom right corner? No, wait in this coordinate system, UP increases y. So if I'm at (3,7), moving up would take me to (3,8). Then again to (3,9), but then trying to move further up from there isn't possible since it's already on the edge.

But perhaps after moving up a few times, moving right until x=9 is reached, and then moving down towards y=1. Let's see:

After starting at (3,6):

Move UP → (3,7). No collision.
Then RIGHT to (4,7), then again RIGHT to (5,7).
Then RIGHT to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then RIGHT to (9,7).

Now at (9,7). Now I need to move down from there towards y=1. So first move DOWN: (9,6), then again DOWN to (9,5)... until reach (9,1). But wait in between, are any of those positions occupied by the body?

The snake's body after moving up once is [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)]. Then each move adds a new head and removes tail unless eating apple.

So when we're at (9,7) as head:

- Move DOWN to (9,6): check if any body cells are there. The current body after moving up is [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)] and then new head is (9,6). So none of the existing body parts are at (9,6). Then move down.

Next step: from (9,6) to (9,5): same logic; no collision. Continue down until reach y=1.

But in this case, moving straight RIGHT and then straight DOWN would pass through positions that may or may not be blocked by the body.

Wait, but after each move, the snake's body shifts forward except when it eats the apple. So from (3,6) to (3,7), the new head is (3,7). Then moving right five times gets us to x=8, y=7.

Then another RIGHT to (9,7).

Now at (9,7), moving DOWN step by step: each time, check if any body parts are in those positions. Let's see:

Body after several moves would be [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), ... , (8,7)].

Wait, no. The snake is moving right each time except when changing direction to down. So the body segments are at increasing x until x=9, then y decreases.

So after several moves, as we move from (3,6) to (9,7), the rest of the body remains at lower x's but higher y's. Then once at (9,7), moving down would have head positions decreasing in y.

But wait, when moving from (9,7) to (9,6): any chance that some part of the snake is at (9,y)? The initial body was [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)]. Then as we moved right each time, adding new heads and removing tails. So after moving from (3,6) to (3,7): body is [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

Then move RIGHT five times:

- From (3,7) to (4,7).
- Then (5,7), etc., up to (9,7).

At this point, the snake's body is [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), ..., (9,7)]. Wait no: each move adds a new head and removes the tail. So moving from (3,7) to (4,7): body becomes [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,7)].

Then next move RIGHT to (5,7): body is [(2,3), (3,4), (4,5?), no. Wait, after each move:

Initial position: (3,6). Direction: UP.
Move 1: head at (3,7). Body becomes [ (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) ].

Then next moves RIGHT five times. Each time the body shifts:

After move 2: head at (4,7). Body is [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,7)].
Move 3: (5,7); body becomes [ ... , (5,7) ].
...
Move 6: From x=8 to x=9. Now head at (9,7). Body is now [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,7), ..., (9,7)].

So after this step, the body includes all those segments along x from 2 to 9 and y=7. So when moving down from (9,7) to (9,6), we need to check if any part of the snake is at (9,y). 

Looking at current body: for y=6, are there any parts? Let's see: after each RIGHT move, the body segments were increasing in x. So when moving down from (9,7) to (9,6), we need to check if any segment is already at (9,6).

Wait, no because once you're at (9,7), your next head positions are decreasing y but same x=9.

So the body after several moves would be:

- Starting from (2,3)
- Then when moving RIGHT, adding new heads at increasing x with same or varying y. But I think in this path, we moved directly right without changing y until reaching (9,7). So body segments are all along y=7.

Wait no: the initial direction is up to (3,7), then moves right each time keeping y fixed.

So after moving RIGHT multiple times, the snake's body at lower x positions have same y as previous step. So when we're at (9,7) and start moving down, checking for collision:

Each move from (9,y) will check if any part of the current body is there.

But in this path, all segments except head are on lower x or same x but different y's? Wait no: initial body after first step is [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

Then moving RIGHT each time shifts the body to higher x with same y=7 for all segments except the new head. So when at (9,7), body includes:

- (2,3)
- (3,4)
- (3,5)
- (3,6)
- (3,7)
- Then after first RIGHT: (4,7)
- Next: (5,7)
- etc., up to x=9.

So when moving down from (9,7) to (9,6), need to check if any body part is at (9,6). Currently, no. Because the snake's body along y=6 includes only head segments that have moved past this point?

Wait I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think differently.

Each move adds a new head and removes an old tail unless apple is eaten.

So starting from initial position:

Move 1: (3,7). Body becomes [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].
Move 2: Right to (4,7). Body becomes [ ... , (4,7) ] → new head is (4,7); tail removed the first element? Wait no.

Wait when moving direction changes or continues straight?

Wait in this scenario, after the initial UP move, the snake's next moves are RIGHT. So it was moving straight right for five steps:

From (3,6) to (3,7): body is [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].
Then from (3,7) to (4,7): remove the first element and add new head → body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7)].

Wait no. When moving in a straight line without turning, each move just extends the snake's head while removing the tail from previous position.

So after first UP: head is (3,7); body is [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

Then moving RIGHT once:

- New head at (4,7). Body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7)].
But wait that's incorrect because the body should consist of previous segments except the last one. So after first move: [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

After moving RIGHT once:

New head is (4,7). The rest are shifted right by one in x-coordinate? No, wait when moving right, each body segment moves to next higher x, keeping y the same. So after this move, the snake's body becomes [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,7)].

Wait no: initial after first UP:

Body is [A, B, C, D, E] where A=(2,3), B=(3,4), C=(3,5), D=(3,6), E=(3,7).

Moving RIGHT once: new head at (E.x +1, E.y) = (4,7). Then the body becomes [B, C, D, E, F], where F is new head.

So body after this move would be [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7)].

Wait no: when moving straight right in same y, each segment's x increases by 1. So for the next step:

After first UP:

Body segments are at increasing x along y=7.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

The main point is to find a path from (3,6) to (9,1), avoiding collision with snake body and walls.

Alternative approach: instead of moving up first, perhaps it's better to move right until x reaches 8, then up to y=7, and then down towards the target. But without getting blocked by the initial body segments.

Wait let me think again:

Starting at (3,6). If I keep moving RIGHT, the snake will extend from x=3 to x=9 in six steps? No: 3 →4→5→6→7→8→9 is seven steps. But we only need six for y adjustment.

But wait our target is (9,1), so after reaching x=9, then need to move down five times from y=7 (as per initial plan) would get us to (9,2). Then again moving DOWN until reach (9,1).

Wait but the initial body segments are at [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

When we start moving RIGHT from (3,6):

- Move 1: to (4,6) → check if any snake part is here. Original body after first move would be [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,6)].

Wait no:

After moving RIGHT once from (3,6):

- New head at (4,6). The previous tail was at (2,3)? Or is the tail just removed?

Actually, each move adds a new head and removes the old tail except when eating apple or in some cases. So starting from initial body [A,B,C,D,E] = [(2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

Moving RIGHT once:

- New head is at (E.x +1, E.y) → (4,7).
- Body becomes [B, C, D, E, new head].

So body after first move: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7)].

Then next move RIGHT:

New head at (5,7). Body is [(3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7)].

After several moves like this, after moving RIGHT five times from x=3 to x=8:

Body would be [(3,9?), wait no. Wait if starting at y=7 and moving right with same y, then all body segments except the new head are shifted along same y?

Wait perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternative idea: perhaps move up once (to (3,7)), then make a U-turn to start moving down towards apple.

But this might cause collision because after moving UP, the snake is near the top of grid which may interfere with the body when turning back.

Alternatively, plan a path that moves around the initial body segments.

Starting at (3,6), move UP once → (3,7). Now need to adjust x from 3→9 and y from 7→1. So direction is RIGHT for x until reach 8, then UP to get past some of the initial body.

From (3,7) moving right:

First move: (4,7).
Check if any snake segment at (4,7): No.
Second move: (5,7). Similarly no collision.
Third move: (6,7).
Fourth move: (7,7).
Fifth move: (8,7).
Now sixth move: right to x=9.

At this point, head is at (9,7). Now body includes all previous segments except the first. So:

Original after moving UP once and RIGHT five times: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), ..., (8,7)].

Now to move down from y=7→1 at x=9.

Each step DOWN must check if any body part is there.

Move 7: (9,6). No collision with body.
Move 8: (9,5).
...
Continue moving DOWN until reaching (9,1).

But will this path cause the snake to collide with its own body? Let's think:

At each step when moving down from y=7 to y=1 at x=9, are any of those positions already occupied by snake segments?

Current snake body after moving UP once and RIGHT five times is [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), ..., (8,7)].

When moving down from y=7 to y=1 at x=9:

Each position (9,y) for y=6 downto 1.

- At y=6: is any snake segment at (9,6)? No.
- Similarly, until y=1.

So it's safe.

But after each move, the body shifts. So when moving DOWN from (9,7), new head positions are:

(9,6): no collision.
Next: (9,5).
...
Up to (9,1).

No part of the snake is at these positions because they're only being added as new heads and tails removed.

Thus, this path seems viable.

So total moves would be:

Start → move UP once → move RIGHT five times → move DOWN six times. Wait no: moving UP once (move 1), then RIGHT five times (moves 2-6), then DOWN six times? Let's count all steps.

Wait after initial position, first move is UP to (3,7) → that's one move.
Then from (3,7), right to (4,7): second move.
Right again: third.
Continue until x=8 at fifth move. Wait no:

Wait starting from (3,6):

1. UP → (3,7).
2. RIGHT → (4,7). Body now includes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7)].
3. RIGHT → (5,7). Body: [ (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7) ].
...
After five moves to the right from x=3:

- Move 2: (4,7)
- Move3: (5,7)
- Move4: (6,7)
- Move5: (7,7)
- Move6: (8,7)

Now at (8,7), then move RIGHT once to reach x=9.

Move7: (9,7). Body is [ (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), ..., (8,7) ] → after moving right, new body would be [(5,7), ..., (9,7)]?

Wait maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Let's clarify:

Each move adds a head and removes the tail.

Original initial state: positions are (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).

Move1: UP to (3,7). Body becomes [ (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) ].

Wait no. Wait when moving UP from (3,6) to (3,7):

The snake's body is extended by the new head and the tail is removed.

So initial body after move1:

Positions: [A=(2,3), B=(3,4), C=(3,5), D=(3,6)] → moved up, so new head E=(3,7). Body becomes [B, C, D, E].

Wait this is how it works.

So each move adds a new head and removes the tail unless apple is eaten.

Thus:

Move1: UP from (3,6) to (3,7). Body was [A,B,C,D,E] = [(2,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7)].
After move1, body becomes [B,C,D,E], with E being new head.

So after first UP:

Body is [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

Now from there, moving RIGHT once: to (4,7). Body would be shifted by one in x, keeping y same. So body becomes [C,D,E,F], where F=(4,7).

So:

After first move UP:
Body = [(3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].

Wait no, initial after move1: head is at (3,7). Body was initially four segments, so after moving RIGHT once, the new body would be [C,D,E,F] where C=(3,5), D=(3,6), E=(3,7), F=(4,7)].

Wait this is getting too detailed. Maybe it's better to assume that each move adds a head and removes the tail except when apple eaten.

So after moving UP once (move1):

Body includes all segments from B,C,D,E as before; new position is E= (3,7).

Then next moves are RIGHT:

Move2: Right → F=(4,7). Body becomes [C,D,E,F].
Move3: Right → G=(5,7). Body becomes [D,E,F,G].
...
After five more moves to x=8:

Body would be up to position (8,7).

Then final move to reach x=9.

So after moving RIGHT from (8,7) to (9,7), the body includes positions like D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U... wait I'm losing track.

The key point is that when we start moving down from y=7 at x=9:

Each step DOWN must be checked for collision. Since snake's body doesn't include these (as they are in the tail after the initial steps), and since we're moving straight, it should be fine.

But need to ensure that during this movement, no part of the body is present in the path.

After moving down from y=7→1:

Each position (9,y) for y=6 downto 1. Since none of these are currently occupied by snake segments as per the initial plan, and since we're extending the tail each time, it's safe.

So overall moves would be:

- Move UP once → head at (3,7).
- Then move RIGHT five times to reach x=8.
- Then move RIGHT once more to reach x=9. Total so far: 1+5+1 = 7 moves.
- Then move DOWN six times to reach y=1 from y=7.

Wait but starting at y=7, moving down six times would take us to y=1 (since each move decreases y by 1). So yes:

Move8: (9,6).
Move9: (9,5).
...
Move13: (9,1).

So total moves are 1 + 5 + 1 +6 = 13 moves? Wait no.

Wait initial UP is one move. Then five rights to reach x=8 from x=3: so that's five more moves → up+5= six moves. Then sixth move right to reach x=9: total seven moves. Then moving down from y=7→y=1 requires six steps (since 7-6=1, need six moves).

Wait no:

From y=7 to y=1 is a difference of six units (including both ends). So it's five steps? Wait no.

Each move decreases y by 1. Starting at y=7:

Move8: y=6 → total moves now eight.
...
After six more moves, we reach y=1 in move13?

Wait let me count the number of steps from y=7 to y=1:

- Move8: (9,6)
- Move9: (9,5)
- Move10: (9,4)
- Move11: (9,3)
- Move12: (9,2)
- Move13: (9,1)

So total of six moves after the initial seven. So overall:

Move1: UP → y=7
Moves 2-6: RIGHT five times → x from4→8 at move5.
Move6: RIGHT → x=9
Then moves7-12: DOWN six times.

Wait, no: each move is numbered as one step.

Let me list them:

1. Move UP to (3,7)
2. Move RIGHT to (4,7)
3. Move RIGHT to (5,7)
4. Move RIGHT to (6,7)
5. Move RIGHT to (7,7)
6. Move RIGHT to (8,7)
7. Move RIGHT to (9,7)

Now at x=9, y=7.

Then move down:

8. Move DOWN → (9,6)
9. Move DOWN → (9,5)
10. Move DOWN → (9,4)
11. Move DOWN → (9,3)
12. Move DOWN → (9,2)
13. Move DOWN → (9,1)

So total moves: 13.

But wait after move6 and7 when at x=8 then moving to x=9 is move7? Or no:

Wait from initial position, we have seven moves as follows:

1. UP
2. RIGHT
3. RIGHT
4. RIGHT
5. RIGHT
6. RIGHT → now at (8,7)
7. RIGHT → now at (9,7)

Then down steps:

8 to 13: six more.

So total of 13 moves.

Wait but I think in the initial plan, after moving UP and then five rights to reach x=8, we need one more move to get to x=9, which is seven moves. Then six downs for y from7→1. So total moves 7+6 =13? Wait:

No: first, starting at (3,6).

Move1: UP → (3,7)
Move2: RIGHT →4,7
...
After five rights: x=8.

So move2 to move6: four rights.
Wait, initial position is after move0.

I'm getting tangled here with step counts. Alternatively, perhaps the total number of moves required is 13, but I don't think that's correct because each move adds a head and removes a tail; thus, it can be more efficient.

But regardless of how many steps, as long as we find a path without collision, which seems possible in this plan.

Thus, my conclusion is that moving UP once to get into the y=7 area, then moving RIGHT several times, and finally DOWN six times would allow reaching (9,1) safely.

Therefore, the sequence of moves is:

UP, RIGHT x5, RIGHT, DOWN x6.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position at (3, 6) to reach the target cell (9, 1) without colliding with its own body or any obstacles. The key steps involve moving upward to enter a higher y-coordinate area, extending the x-coordinate by moving right several times, and then descending down along the y-axis.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake starts at (3, 6). We move it upwards to (3, 7) to start expanding its body in a new y-coordinate area.
   
2. **Right Movements:** From (3, 7), we move the snake right five times sequentially to reach x-coordinates 4, 5, 6, 7, and finally 8 at each step.

3. **Final Right Move:** After reaching (8, 7), we make one more right move to extend the body into the x-coordinate 9 at position (9, 7).

4. **Down Movements:** Now positioned at (9, 7), the snake moves down six times sequentially through y-coordinates 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and finally 1.

Each move involves extending the snake's head while ensuring it doesn't overlap with its own body or go out of bounds. This approach ensures a safe path to reach (9, 1).

**Answer:**

The sequence of moves is UP once, then RIGHT five times followed by one more RIGHT, and finally DOWN six times.

$\boxed{UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN}$

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the head now at (3, 6) to eat the apple at (9, 1).

RULES:
- Text at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 is less important than the text at the end.
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
