========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake starts at (9,6) and needs to reach the apple at (3,4). The initial direction is "UP". Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I need to understand the snake's current state. The head is at (9,6), which is near the top-right corner of a 10x10 grid. The body cells are [(9,5), (8,5), (7,5)], so the snake is moving left along y=5 from (9,5) to (7,5). That means the snake's body is in a vertical line going down from the head at (9,6).

The apple is at (3,4), which is somewhere towards the bottom-left of the grid. So, the snake needs to move from near the top-right down to the middle-left area.

Since the current direction is "UP", which would make the head go to (9,7) if it moves without eating the apple. But that's not helpful because moving up takes it further away from the apple. However, the problem says that after each move, we check for collisions and whether the new head position is valid.

Wait, no, in the movement rules, the direction can't be reversed on the first move unless it's "NONE". So, since the current direction is "UP", the next move cannot be "DOWN" as that would reverse direction. That complicates things because moving up initially isn't helpful for reaching (3,4).

So, maybe the initial direction of "UP" isn't ideal, but perhaps the snake can change direction after the first move without violating the rules.

Let me think about possible moves step by step.

1. Initial head at (9,6), direction is "UP". The body is [(9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
2. Possible directions: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT" but cannot reverse from "UP" to "DOWN".

Wait, no, the rules say that you can't reverse unless it's your first move with direction "NONE". So, if current direction is "UP", next move can be any except "DOWN" (since reversing would be changing from UP to DOWN). So, for the first move, since direction is "UP", the snake cannot go "DOWN". So, possible directions are "UP", "LEFT", or "RIGHT".

Moving "UP" would take it further away. Moving "LEFT" would make the head at (8,6), but then the body follows. Moving "RIGHT" would take it to (10,6), which is outside the grid—so that's invalid.

Wait, no, moving right from x=9 would go to 10, which is beyond the grid (since coordinates are from 0-9). So, "RIGHT" would cause a collision. Therefore, the snake can't move right initially.

So, possible first moves: "UP" or "LEFT".

Moving up to (9,7) seems bad because it's moving away from the apple. But maybe that's necessary if the body blocks other paths.

Alternatively, moving left to (8,6). Let me see what happens in each case.

Case 1: Move "LEFT" first.
- New head at (8,6).
- Check for collisions: The new head should not be outside grid or on any body segment except the tail when it moves. Since the body is [(9,5), (8,5), (7,5)], the head is moving to (8,6). Is that position blocked? No, because the body segments are at y=5. So, safe.

Now, update the body:
- Insert old head (9,6) at front: Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
- Since new head is not at apple (apple is at 3,4), we remove the tail. So, tail was at (7,5). Now, body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5)].

Head is now at (8,6).

Next move: Now, direction can't be reversed again because previous was "LEFT". Wait, no—the initial direction was "UP", then first move was "LEFT" so the next direction can't reverse from "LEFT"—meaning you can't go "RIGHT" next. So, possible directions are "UP", "DOWN".

But moving down now would take the head towards (8,5). Let me check.

Case 2: After moving left to (8,6), try moving down.
- New head at (8,5).
- Check for collisions: (8,5) is in the body—specifically, it's BODY1. So, moving into a body segment (except possibly the tail when it's moving) causes collision.

Wait, no—the body is [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5)]. The new head would be at (8,5), which is the same as BODY2 (8,5). So, that's a collision because the new head is on a body segment that isn't the tail when it moves. Because in this case, after moving to (8,5), the old head was at (9,6), and the body includes (8,5) which is BODY2.

So, moving down would cause a collision. Therefore, that's invalid.

Alternatively, can we move "UP" from (8,6)?

Moving up to (8,7). That seems to be going away from the apple as well. Let me check for collisions: new head at (8,7) is empty. So, safe.

Update body:
- Insert old head (8,6) at front: body becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)].
- Remove tail (since not eating apple): remove (8,5). So new body is [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5)].

Head now at (8,7).

This seems like it's going in circles. Maybe moving up initially isn't the right approach.

Let me think about alternative strategies.

What if we try to go right first? But earlier analysis showed that from (9,6), moving right would take us outside the grid. So, initial "RIGHT" is invalid.

So, perhaps the snake needs to move left and then down, but need to manage body segments carefully.

Wait, in the initial position, after moving left to (8,6), can we then move down?

But when we tried that, moving from (8,6) down to (8,5) would land on a body segment. So, collision occurs.

So, maybe we need to adjust the path to avoid that.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake should move left again to create space.

Let me simulate:

1. Initial head at (9,6), direction "UP".
2. Move "LEFT" → (8,6).
   - Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
3. Next, instead of moving down, move left again to (7,6).
   - Check for collisions: new head at (7,6) is empty.
   - Update body:
     a. Insert old head (8,6) → body becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
     b. Since not eating apple, remove tail (7,5). So body is [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)].
   - Head now at (7,6).
4. Next move: possible directions are "UP", "DOWN" because last was left.

Moving down from (7,6) to (7,5). Is that valid?

Check for collisions: new head is at (7,5), which is in the body (BODY4). So, collision occurs.

Hmm, can't move down. Maybe move up instead? But moving up from (7,6) to (7,7).

Is that safe? Let's see.

Moving to (7,7). Check if it's blocked: no, because current body is [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)]. So, new head at (7,7) is empty.

Update body:
- Insert old head (7,6).
- Remove tail (8,5). So, body becomes [(7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)].
- Head now at (7,7).

This seems to be getting us further away from the apple. Maybe this path isn't working.

Perhaps we need a different approach. Let's think about the Manhattan distance.

The head is at (9,6) and apple is at (3,4). The difference in x is 6 units left, and y is 2 units down.

So, total moves required would be at least 8 steps (since Manhattan distance is 6+2=8). But the snake can't move diagonally; each step changes either x or y by 1.

But considering the body segments, we need to ensure that after each move, the body remains continuous.

Another approach: maybe try to eat the apple by moving towards it while managing the body.

Wait, the initial direction is "UP". So, perhaps on the first move, the snake can change direction if possible. But according to the rules, you cannot reverse direction unless it's your first move with "NONE".

So, from "UP", the next move can't be "DOWN". It can be "LEFT" or "RIGHT" or "UP".

But moving right is invalid because it goes outside.

Moving left is possible. Let me see:

1. Start at (9,6), direction UP.
2. Move LEFT to (8,6).
   - Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
3. Now, direction can't be RIGHT or DOWN because last move was LEFT? Wait no—the rule is about reversing.

Wait, the movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction unless it's your first move with "NONE". So, if current direction is "UP", next move can't be "DOWN" (reverse). But moving left isn't a reversal from UP; so after that, what are the restrictions?

After moving LEFT, last direction was LEFT. So, next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse.

So, possible directions: UP, DOWN.

Hmm, maybe after moving left to (8,6), then try to go down.

But earlier when I tried that, it landed on a body segment. Let me check again.

From (8,6), direction "DOWN" → (8,5).

Body is [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]. So, (8,5) is a body cell—specifically BODY3.

Therefore, moving down would cause collision. Not allowed.

Alternative: move UP again to (8,7). But that's going away from the apple.

Wait, perhaps we can create space by moving up and then left again.

Let me try:

1. Start at (9,6), direction UP.
2. Move LEFT → (8,6).
   - Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
3. Now, move UP → (8,7).
   - Check: new head is empty.
   - Update body:
     a. Insert old head (8,6) at front → [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
     b. Remove tail (7,5) → body becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)].
   - Head now at (8,7).
4. Next move: last direction was UP, so can't reverse to DOWN.

Possible directions: LEFT or UP again.

Moving LEFT from (8,7) → (7,7). Is that safe?

Check for collisions: new head is empty.

Update body:
- Insert old head (8,7).
- Remove tail (8,5) → body becomes [(8,7), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)].
- Head now at (7,7).

This seems to be creating more space but not necessarily getting closer to the apple.

Alternatively, maybe try moving down from (8,7). But last direction was UP, so you can't reverse. So, can't move down next.

Wait, no—if last direction is UP, then next move cannot be DOWN as that would reverse. So, possible moves are LEFT or UP again.

So, seems like the snake is stuck in a loop here.

Perhaps another approach: try to change direction towards the apple by moving right when possible, but initial move can't do that because it's outside grid.

Wait, no—can we find a path where the snake can turn around?

Like, move left first, then up, then left again, creating space to move down later.

But I'm not seeing a clear way yet.

Alternative idea: After moving left twice to (7,6), maybe try to go down from there.

Let me simulate:

1. Start at (9,6), direction UP.
2. Move LEFT → (8,6).
   - Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
3. Move LEFT again → (7,6).
   - Check: new head is empty.
   - Update body:
     a. Insert old head (8,6) → body becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
     b. Remove tail (7,5) → body is [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)].
   - Head now at (7,6).
4. Next move: last direction was LEFT, so can't move RIGHT next. Possible directions: UP or DOWN.

If I try to move DOWN from (7,6) → (7,5). Check collision: new head is at (7,5), which is in the body as BODY4. So, collision occurs.

Hmm, not good.

What if I instead move UP again?

From (7,6), moving UP to (7,7).

Check for collisions: empty.
Update body:
- Insert old head (7,6).
- Remove tail (8,5). Body becomes [(7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)].
- Head now at (7,7).

This seems like we're moving away from the apple again.

I'm stuck trying to find a path that both avoids collisions and gets closer to the apple. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternative approach: try to get the snake to face the correct direction without colliding with its body.

The target is (3,4), which is 6 left and 2 down from (9,6). So, to reach there, the snake needs to move left 6 times and down 2 times in some order, while managing the body length.

But since each segment follows the head, as the snake moves, each new head must not collide with its own body.

Another idea: try to make the snake's body shorter by eating the tail. But currently, the snake has a body of 3 segments (from (9,6) to (7,5)). So, maybe if it can eat one segment, it can become shorter and have more flexibility.

But in order to eat, the head needs to be over a specific segment. Let me see where that is.

The initial body is [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]. Wait no—the initial body is [(9,5), (8,5), (7,5)], which are the segments behind the head at (9,6). So, to eat, the snake needs to move over these.

But when moving left from (9,6) to (8,6), it creates a new segment. Let's think:

After first move LEFT → [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].

So, now, if the snake moves down from (8,6) → collision at (8,5).

Alternatively, after moving left once, can we then move forward to eat a segment?

Wait, perhaps after moving left, move down, but in such a way that it creates space.

But I think this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the initial move should be "DOWN" despite the rule about not reversing because sometimes rules have exceptions for certain cases.

Wait, no—the problem states you can't reverse direction unless it's your first move with "NONE". So, since initial direction is "UP", next move cannot be "DOWN".

Therefore, perhaps moving left initially is better, then trying to change direction in a way that doesn't violate the rules.

Another angle: think about what happens when the snake moves towards the apple while managing body segments.

The head needs to go from (9,6) → ... → (3,4). To do that, it must move left 6 times and down 2 times. But each time it moves left or down, it creates a new segment behind it, which can block future movements.

So, maybe the snake should move in such a way that it eats its own tail to shorten itself, allowing more flexibility.

But for that, the head must be positioned over a specific body segment.

Let me try:

1. Start at (9,6), direction UP.
2. Move LEFT → (8,6).
   - Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
3. Now, move down to (8,5). But that's a body segment—collision.

No good.

Alternatively:

1. Start at (9,6), direction UP.
2. Move LEFT → (8,6).
   - Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
3. Then, move LEFT again to (7,6).
   - Check: new head is empty.
   - Update body:
     a. Insert old head (8,6) → [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
     b. Remove tail (7,5) → body becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)].
4. Now at (7,6), last move was LEFT, so can't move RIGHT next.
   - Possible directions: UP or DOWN.

Trying to move down now:

From (7,6) → (7,5). Check collision: new head is at (7,5), which is in the body—specifically BODY4. So, collision occurs.

Not allowed.

Alternatively, try moving up from (7,6) to (7,7).

Check for collisions: safe.
Update body:
- Insert old head (7,6).
- Remove tail (8,5). Body becomes [(7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)].
- Head now at (7,7).

This seems to be getting the snake stuck in a loop again.

Perhaps another approach: after moving left twice, try to create space by moving up and then down again.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe it's time to consider that without changing direction, the snake can't reach the target without colliding with its own body. Therefore, perhaps the initial move should be "DOWN" despite the rule, but the problem says you can't reverse unless it's your first move.

Wait, is moving down from UP considered reversing? Or does it depend on how much you turn?

Alternatively, think about the snake's direction and body segments:

- The head is at (9,6), facing left.
- Body segments are behind: (9,5)←(8,5)←(7,5).

To reach (3,4), need to move left 6 times and down 2 times.

But moving left from (9,6) creates a new segment each time. To avoid collision, the snake must be able to turn around without hitting itself.

Perhaps after creating enough space by moving left, it can then start turning downward.

Wait, let me try:

1. Start at (9,6), direction UP.
2. Move LEFT → (8,6).
   - Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
3. Now, move LEFT again → (7,6).
   - Check: new head is empty.
   - Update body:
     a. Insert old head (8,6) → [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
     b. Remove tail (7,5) → body becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)].
4. Now at (7,6), last move was LEFT, can't move RIGHT next. So try moving DOWN.

From (7,6) ↓ to (7,5). Check collision: new head is at (7,5), which is in the body—specifically segment (8,5). Wait, no—(7,5) is a different cell than (8,5). So, actually, (7,5) is empty? Or is it blocked?

Wait, the body segments are [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)].

So, from (7,6), moving down to (7,5)—is this cell occupied by any segment?

Looking at the current body: [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)]. So, (7,5) is not in the list. Therefore, it's empty.

So, moving down from (7,6) → (7,5). Safe.

Update body:
- Insert old head (7,6).
- Remove tail (8,5) → body becomes [(7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)].
- Head now at (7,5).

Wait, no—after moving down, the new head is at (7,5). So, the body should be:

[(7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)].

But wait, when you move down from (7,6) to (7,5), you're adding a new segment at (7,6) and removing the tail. So:

- Previous body: [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)]
- Inserting (7,6) as the new head.
- Removing the last segment (which was (8,5)).

Therefore, new body: [(7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)].

But wait, the head is now at (7,5). Or did I make a mistake?

Wait no—the movement adds a new segment where the head was. So when you move from (7,6) to (7,5), you add (7,5) as a body segment and remove the tail.

So, correct body becomes:

[(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6)]? No—that doesn't make sense because we moved from (7,6) to (7,5).

Wait, I think I confused something. Let's retrace.

After moving down from (7,6) → (7,5):

- The head moves from (7,6) to (7,5).
- So, the new body segments are: [(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6)].

Wait no—the segments behind the head should be updated. When moving down, the segment that was at (7,6) is now gone, replaced by (7,5).

But in our previous step, after two LEFT moves and a DOWN move, we were at (7,5). So:

- Body: [(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6)].

Hmm, but now the head is at (7,5), which is over (8,5) in the previous body. Wait, no—(7,5) is a new position, not overlapping with existing segments.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a list where each new head is added at the front, and the tail is removed if necessary.

So, let's try:

1. Initial state: [(9,6)] (head), body: [(9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
2. Move LEFT → new head (8,6). Body becomes [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]. Tail remains (7,5) since it hasn't moved.
3. Move LEFT again → new head (7,6). Body becomes [(7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]. Tail is still (7,5).
4. Now at (7,6). Last move was LEFT, so can't move RIGHT next.
   - Try moving DOWN: new head (7,5).
     a. Insert (7,5) → body becomes [(7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
     b. Now, since the tail is still at (7,5), but we just added another segment there? That would be a collision.

Wait, no—when you move, the head moves and adds a new segment at its old position. So moving from (7,6) to (7,5):

- Old head was at (7,6).
- New head is at (7,5).
- The body now has [(7,5), ... , (8,5), (9,5), etc.].

Wait, but the segment that was previously at (7,6) is now gone because it's the new tail. No—wait, no: when moving, you add a segment where the head used to be and remove the old tail.

So, correct process:

1. After two LEFT moves:
   - Head at (7,6).
   - Body segments: [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].
2. Move DOWN from (7,6) to (7,5):
   - Add (7,5) as a new body segment and remove the previous tail (which was also at (7,5)? No, wait.

Wait, initial after two LEFT moves: head at (7,6), with body segments [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)].

When moving down from (7,6) to (7,5):

- The new head is at (7,5).
- So, we add the previous head position (7,6) as a body segment.
- And remove the tail, which was (7,5).

Wait no—tail removal only happens when you eat. But in this case, moving down doesn't necessarily mean eating unless it's over an existing segment.

I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe using a snake game-like approach would help:

Each move adds a new segment where the head was and removes the tail if it moves beyond the current segments.

But in reality, when you move the head to a new position, you create a new body segment at the old head position and remove the oldest segment (if any) from the tail.

So, let's model this:

1. Initial state:
   - Head: (9,6)
   - Body: [(9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]
2. Move LEFT to (8,6):
   - New body: [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)] (added new head at old position and kept all previous segments)
3. Now, move LEFT again to (7,6):
   - New body: [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]
4. Now, move DOWN from (7,6) to (7,5):
   - Check if (7,5) is in the body? No.
   - Add new segment at (7,6): [(7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]
   - But since we moved down, do we need to remove a tail? Only if moving beyond the current body length.

Wait, no—the movement adds a new segment and doesn't necessarily remove anything unless it's in the standard snake game where you can only have so many segments.

But in reality, the body grows by one when you move, but if you don't eat, how does that work? Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, think of it as:

- Each time you move, your head goes to a new position.
- If that new position is already part of your body (excluding the head), you have to remove the tail to avoid collision.
- Otherwise, just add the new head and keep the tail.

So, in this case:

1. After two LEFT moves:
   - Body segments: [(8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]
2. Moving DOWN from (7,6) to (7,5):
   - Check if (7,5) is in the body except as head? Yes, it's at position 4.
   - So, remove the tail (which was (7,5)) and add new head at (7,5).
   - New body: [(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (7,6)].

Wait, no—because when you move to (7,5), you're adding a segment at the previous head position (7,6). So:

- Remove the oldest segment from the tail if necessary.
   - If moving causes collision, remove the tail and add new head.
   - Otherwise, just add new head.

But this is getting too confusing. Maybe it's time to look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps after three LEFT moves and one DOWN move, the snake can reach (7,5). Then from there, continue moving left and down.

But since I need to reach (3,4), which is far to the left and a bit down, maybe the snake needs to create enough space by moving left several times.

Alternatively, think of the grid as coordinates where x decreases to the left.

So starting at (9,6):

- Move LEFT: (8,6)
- Again: (7,6)
- Again: (6,6)
- Etc., until (3,6), then move down to (3,5), etc.

But each time you move, if it's a new position, you just add the segment and keep the tail unless you collide.

But without actually coding this, it's hard to track. However, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the key is that after moving left enough times, the snake can turn down without colliding.

Given that, maybe the minimal path is:

From (9,6):

1. Move LEFT 6 times: (3,6)
2. Then move DOWN 4 times: (3,2)
But wait, (3,2) is not (3,4). Hmm.

Alternatively, after moving to (3,6), maybe then move down twice and left once more?

No, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is needed. Maybe model the problem as BFS, where each state is the snake's head position and its body segments.

But since this is time-consuming, I'll try to reason it out.

The target is (3,4). Starting at (9,6).

To reach (3,4), need to move left 6 times (from x=9 to x=3) and down 2 times (from y=6 to y=4).

Each move adds a segment where the head was, potentially causing collision.

So, to move from (9,6) to (8,6): safe.
Then to (7,6), then (6,6), etc., until (3,6). At each step, adding segments leftwards.

Once at (3,6), need to move down. But moving down from (3,6) would add a segment at (3,6), so body becomes [(3,5), (3,6), ...]. Then next move down to (3,4):

- Add (3,4) as new head.
- Check if (3,4) is already in the body. If not, proceed.

But wait, from (3,6), moving down:

- New position: (3,5). Check body. Body segments would be [(3,5), (3,6), ...]. So no collision.
Then next move to (3,4):

- Add (3,4) and remove tail if necessary.

But in this case, the snake's body from (9,6) to (3,4) requires moving left 6 times and down twice. Each movement adds a segment.

However, when moving down, you have to ensure that the new head doesn't overlap with existing segments.

Since starting at (9,6), moving left each time adds segments along x decreasing. Moving down from (3,6) would add (3,5), then (3,4). Since these y positions are lower than previous ones, and x is same, it shouldn't collide with the existing segments.

Therefore, it's possible to reach (3,4).

So, the minimal moves would be 6 LEFTs and 2 DOWNs. Total of 8 moves.

But wait, in reality, moving down when at (3,6) might cause collision if body is too long. Let me think:

After moving left 6 times from (9,6), head is at (3,6). Body segments are [(3,6), (4,6), ..., (9,6)]. So total of 7 segments? No—each move adds one segment.

Wait no, starting from (9,6) with body empty except head. After first LEFT: body has [(9,6), (8,6)].
Second LEFT: [(8,6), (9,6), (7,6)].
Third: [(7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (6,6)].
Fourth: [(6,6), ..., up to (4,6)].
Fifth: [(5,6), ..., (3,6)].
Sixth: [(3,6), (4,6), ..., (9,6)].

So after 6 LEFTs, body has 7 segments from (3,6) to (9,6). So length is 7.

Now, moving down from (3,6) to (3,5):

- New head at (3,5).
- Check if this position is already in the body. Body includes (3,6), so no.
- Now, body becomes [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), ..., (9,6)].

Length remains 7.

Next move down to (3,4):

- New head at (3,4).
- Check if in body: No.
- Body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), ..., (9,6)].

Still safe. So total moves: 6 LEFT + 2 DOWN = 8 moves.

But wait, each time you move down from y=6 to y=5 and then y=4, but the body segments are at higher y positions, so no collision occurs because lower y positions haven't been visited yet.

Therefore, it's possible. So, the minimal number of moves is 8: 6 LEFTs and 2 DOWNs.

But wait, in reality, after moving down from (3,6) to (3,5), the body has a segment at (3,6). Moving again to (3,4):

- New head at (3,4).
- Check if any part of the body is at (3,4): No.
So safe.

Thus, the minimal number of moves required is 8: 6 lefts and 2 downs.
</think>

To reach the target position (3,4) starting from (9,6), the snake must move left six times and down two times. Each movement adds a new segment without causing collision with existing body segments. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** (9,6)
2. **Move Left:** Reaches (8,6) after 1st LEFT.
3. **Move Left:** Reaches (7,6) after 2nd LEFT.
4. **Move Left:** Reaches (6,6) after 3rd LEFT.
5. **Move Left:** Reaches (5,6) after 4th LEFT.
6. **Move Left:** Reaches (4,6) after 5th LEFT.
7. **Move Left:** Reaches (3,6) after 6th LEFT.
8. **Move Down:** Reaches (3,5) after 1st DOWN.
9. **Move Down:** Reaches (3,4) after 2nd DOWN.

Total moves required: 6 LEFT + 2 DOWN = 8 moves.

**Answer:** The minimal number of moves required is \boxed{8}.
