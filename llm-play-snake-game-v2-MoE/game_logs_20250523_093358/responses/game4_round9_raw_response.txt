========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the current game state and plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple.

Here's what we know:

- Current head position: (2, 9)
- Apple position: (1, 4)

To get from (2, 9) to (1, 4):
- We need to move LEFT once (from x=2 to x=1)
- We need to move DOWN five times (from y=9 to y=4)

The snake is currently moving UP. Since we can't reverse direction immediately, the first move must be either LEFT or RIGHT.

Let's plan the path step by step:

1. Move LEFT once (to get to x=1)
2. Then move DOWN 5 times (to get to y=4)

Since we need to avoid collisions with the body and walls, let's check if this path is safe.

Current body cells: [(3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8)]
- After moving LEFT once, our new head will be at (1, 9)
- We need to make sure we won't run into the snake's body or go out of bounds

Let's construct the path and check for safety:

1. Move LEFT (from (2, 9) to (1, 9))
2. Move DOWN five times (from (1, 9) to (1, 4))

We need to verify that no position in this path will collide with the body or go out of bounds. The body positions are:
- [(3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8)]

As we move from (2, 9) to (1, 9) and then downwards, none of these intermediate positions should overlap with the snake's body.

Now let me check if this path actually works:

Let's confirm the planned moves:
- Move LEFT once
- Then DOWN five times

So our path would be: ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"]

But we need to make sure that after reaching (1, 4), there is at least one legal move. Let's verify:

When we reach (1, 4):
- We can go LEFT or RIGHT from here (since x=1 is on the left edge but not out of bounds)
- We cannot go UP since it will collide with our body

So the path seems safe and valid.

Here's the final JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move LEFT once to reach x=1, then move DOWN five times to reach y=4. This path avoids collisions with walls and body."
}
```
