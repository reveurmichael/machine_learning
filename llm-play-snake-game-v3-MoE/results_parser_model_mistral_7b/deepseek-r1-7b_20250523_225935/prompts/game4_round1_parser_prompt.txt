You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out a path for the snake to move from (5,5) to (6,5). The snake's current direction is "NONE", which means it can choose any of the four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. The body list is empty, so this snake has only its head. That makes things easier because there are no other body segments blocking the path.

First, I should consider moving towards the apple at (6,5). Since both the head and the apple have the same y-coordinate, which is 5, the snake needs to move right once. So, if it moves RIGHT, the new head position will be (6,5), which is exactly where the apple is located.

I should check for any possible collisions before moving. Since the body list is empty, there's no other segment to collide with except possibly when the tail moves. But since this snake has only a head and no body behind it, moving RIGHT won't cause any collision issues because there's nothing in the way. 

Additionally, after eating the apple, I need to make sure that the snake can still move at least one more time without getting trapped. Since the snake is just a single segment now (after growing by one when it eats the apple), as long as it doesn't block itself completely, which isn't an issue here because there's only one segment.

So, moving RIGHT once should suffice to reach the apple safely without any collisions.
</think>

The snake can move right directly to reach the apple. Since the body is empty and there are no other segments to collide with, this path is safe.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving right from (5,5) leads directly to the apple at (6,5). There's a clear path as the snake has no body segments to block it."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (6, 5).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
