========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 6 times (from x=8 to x=2) and down 2 times (from y=3 to y=1). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing the initial DOWN direction. Each LEFT move shifts the body left, keeping the head safe from collision. After reaching (2,3), moving DOWN twice reaches the apple at (2,1). Post-apple, there are safe moves (e.g., DOWN to (2,0)) ensuring no immediate trapping."
