========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly to the right of the snake's head at (9,4). Moving RIGHT from (8,4) reaches the apple in one step. This move is safe as (9,4) is within grid bounds and not occupied by any body segment. After eating, the snake grows, and there are valid subsequent moves (e.g., UP, DOWN) to avoid trapping."
