{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,0) with the head, and the apple is at (5,9) directly above. The body initially blocks (5,1) and (5,2), so the snake first moves RIGHT to (6,0) to shift the body right. Then, it moves UP five times to (6,3), creating space. Next, it moves LEFT to (5,3) to align with the vertical path. Finally, it moves UP six more times to reach (5,9), avoiding collisions and ensuring the body shifts safely each step. After eating the apple, there are legal moves available (e.g., UP, LEFT, RIGHT)."
