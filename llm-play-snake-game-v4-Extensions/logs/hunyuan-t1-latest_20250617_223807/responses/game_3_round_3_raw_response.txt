========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 3 left (from x=3 to 0) and 2 down (from y=2 to 0). Starting with LEFT avoids reversing direction (current direction is DOWN). Each LEFT move shifts the head left while the body follows, avoiding collisions. After reaching (0,2), moving DOWN twice reaches (0,0) (the apple). Post-apple, a RIGHT move is possible, preventing entrapment."
