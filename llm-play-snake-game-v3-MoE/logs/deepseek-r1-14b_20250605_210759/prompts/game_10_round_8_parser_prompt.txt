========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (5,9) to the apple at (6,4). 

First, I'll look at the current state. The head is at (5,9), which is the top-middle of the grid. The body cells are [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6)]. So, the snake is moving in a way that it's going right and then down from there.

The direction is currently "UP", but I can't reverse to "DOWN" immediately. Wait, no—current direction is "UP". So next move cannot be "DOWN". The current movement options are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But since the head is at (5,9), moving UP would take it out of bounds because y=10 is beyond the grid. So the only possible initial moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

Looking at the apple's position at (6,4), which is below and to the right. The Manhattan distance is 1 (x) + 5 (y) = 6 steps in total. But I need to plan a path that avoids collisions with the body and walls.

If I move RIGHT first from (5,9), that would take the head to (6,9). Let me check if this position is safe. The body cells are behind, so the new head should not collide with any body parts except possibly the tail when it moves. But since moving right doesn't immediately hit any body segments, it's safe.

Next, I need to decide on a path that takes the snake down towards (6,4). After moving RIGHT once, maybe turning DOWN and proceeding. But I have to be careful about the body segments as they will shift each move.

Wait, but after the first move, the body will update. The initial moves should ensure that each step is safe, considering how the body shifts. So perhaps a series of DOWN moves after moving right once or twice could work.

Alternatively, maybe moving LEFT first isn't the best because it would go to (4,9), which might complicate the path towards (6,4). Moving RIGHT seems more straightforward as it directly approaches the apple's x-coordinate.

So, initial move is RIGHT. Then, from there, I can start moving DOWN towards y=4. But need to make sure that each step doesn't hit any body segments or walls.

I should also consider if eating the apple will cause any issues. After eating, the snake grows, so I must ensure that after growth, the next move is still possible. 

Another thing: the current direction is UP, and moving RIGHT is allowed as it's not reversing. So first move can be RIGHT.

Therefore, my plan starts with a move to the RIGHT.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake begins at (5,9) heading towards the apple at (6,4). The initial move to the right is safe as it avoids collisions and moves closer to the target."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 9) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (6, 4). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
