00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:01,400
today I'm going to build five Lego
 

3
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,230
today I'm going to build five Lego
turbine engines to test which ones can

4
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:03,240
turbine engines to test which ones can
 

5
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,630
turbine engines to test which ones can
generate the most

6
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:05,640
generate the most
 

7
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,470
generate the most
power make sure you guys stick to the

8
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:07,480
power make sure you guys stick to the
 

9
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,910
power make sure you guys stick to the
end because the last one it's going to

10
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:08,920
end because the last one it's going to
 

11
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,669
end because the last one it's going to
blow you away also this video is

12
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:10,679
blow you away also this video is

sponsored by Shopify but more on them
 

15
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,669
sponsored by Shopify but more on them
later essentially each one of these

16
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
later essentially each one of these
 

17
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,910
later essentially each one of these
engines we're trying to build is going

18
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
engines we're trying to build is going
 

19
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,630
engines we're trying to build is going
to take some sort of natural force like

20
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
to take some sort of natural force like
 

21
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,550
to take some sort of natural force like
water or air or heat and they're going

22
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
water or air or heat and they're going
 

23
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,189
water or air or heat and they're going
to turn that into electricity or

24
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:20,199
to turn that into electricity or
 

25
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,670
to turn that into electricity or
rotational energy starting with our

26
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
rotational energy starting with our
 

27
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,870
rotational energy starting with our
first build which is going to be a

28
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880
first build which is going to be a
 

29
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,429
first build which is going to be a
vacuum turbo if we build together a

30
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:24,439
vacuum turbo if we build together a
 

31
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,029
vacuum turbo if we build together a
couple of these little cylinder pieces

32
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:26,039
couple of these little cylinder pieces
 

33
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,870
couple of these little cylinder pieces
with an exit on both sides and that

34
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:27,880
with an exit on both sides and that
 

35
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,990
with an exit on both sides and that
should let us control the direction of

36
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,000
should let us control the direction of
 

37
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,990
should let us control the direction of
the air fr

38
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,000
the air fr
 

39
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,109
the air fr
so now look this is what it's supposed

40
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:32,119
so now look this is what it's supposed
 

41
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,310
so now look this is what it's supposed
to do we're going to have the air which

42
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:33,320
to do we're going to have the air which
 

43
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,869
to do we're going to have the air which
is going to suck from this side and then

44
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:34,879
is going to suck from this side and then
 

45
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,270
is going to suck from this side and then
if we cap this off and create a little

46
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,280
if we cap this off and create a little
 

47
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,030
if we cap this off and create a little
spinny thing on the inside of this we

48
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,040
spinny thing on the inside of this we
 

49
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,709
spinny thing on the inside of this we
should be able to take an axle from that

50
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:39,719
should be able to take an axle from that
 

51
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,310
should be able to take an axle from that
and it should spin then we just need

52
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,320
and it should spin then we just need
 

53
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,029
and it should spin then we just need
something with wings to attach to that

54
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:43,039
something with wings to attach to that
 

55
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,069
something with wings to attach to that
I'm going use a few of these gears and

56
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
I'm going use a few of these gears and
 

57
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,430
I'm going use a few of these gears and
then just attach some lift arms to the

58
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
then just attach some lift arms to the
 

59
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,670
then just attach some lift arms to the
top of these and that should hopefully

60
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:46,680
top of these and that should hopefully
 

61
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,069
top of these and that should hopefully
create a little wings

62
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
create a little wings
 

63
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,709
create a little wings
propeller all right now we just got to

64
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
propeller all right now we just got to
 

65
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,990
propeller all right now we just got to
attach that to this axle inside this guy

66
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,000
attach that to this axle inside this guy
 

67
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,470
attach that to this axle inside this guy
now will that work probably not because

68
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
now will that work probably not because
 

69
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,430
now will that work probably not because
it's not taking up the entire thing we

70
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:56,440
it's not taking up the entire thing we
 

71
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,430
it's not taking up the entire thing we
might just need to make the blades a

72
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
might just need to make the blades a
 

73
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,189
might just need to make the blades a
little bigger

74
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199

 

75
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,990

okay I've added a few more pieces to

76
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,000
okay I've added a few more pieces to
 

77
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,189
okay I've added a few more pieces to
seal this in a little bit better let's

78
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
seal this in a little bit better let's
 

79
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,350
seal this in a little bit better let's
see if this

80
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360

 

81
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,030

works why is it turning that way

82
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
works why is it turning that way
 

83
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,429
works why is it turning that way
oh I get it now we need to put this box

84
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
oh I get it now we need to put this box
 

85
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,350
oh I get it now we need to put this box
shape up here because then no matter

86
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
shape up here because then no matter
 

87
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,870
shape up here because then no matter
which side we go from it'll be sucking

88
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
which side we go from it'll be sucking
 

89
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,550
which side we go from it'll be sucking
air across and this thing will keep

90
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
air across and this thing will keep
 

91
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,469
air across and this thing will keep
spinning quick

92
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
spinning quick
 

93
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,630
spinning quick
redesign so to actually test the energy

94
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
redesign so to actually test the energy
 

95
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,550
redesign so to actually test the energy
output of these turbines I have here

96
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
output of these turbines I have here
 

97
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,190

inside of it are a bunch of cool
Electronics like the solar panel and

102
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:31,479
Electronics like the solar panel and
 

103
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,030
Electronics like the solar panel and
some lights but the important part

104
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
some lights but the important part
 

105
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,910
some lights but the important part
inside of here is this thing this is a

106
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:34,920
inside of here is this thing this is a
 

107
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,670
inside of here is this thing this is a
type of Lego voltage meter and when we

108
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:36,680
type of Lego voltage meter and when we
 

109
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,149
type of Lego voltage meter and when we
hook it up to this little battery here

110
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
hook it up to this little battery here
 

111
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,670
hook it up to this little battery here
and the special motor that it comes with

112
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
and the special motor that it comes with
 

113
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,030
and the special motor that it comes with
we can actually utilize this motor as a

114
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
we can actually utilize this motor as a
 

115
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,870
we can actually utilize this motor as a
generator and then calculate how much

116
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
generator and then calculate how much
 

117
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,469
generator and then calculate how much
energy it's producing and then to test

118
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
energy it's producing and then to test
 

119
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,789
energy it's producing and then to test
the speed of our Motors we have this

120
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:45,799
the speed of our Motors we have this
 

121
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,870
the speed of our Motors we have this
little Lego Technic speed gauge and

122
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,880
little Lego Technic speed gauge and
 

123
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,389
little Lego Technic speed gauge and
that'll let us see the RPM the turbines

124
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:49,399
that'll let us see the RPM the turbines
 

125
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,469
that'll let us see the RPM the turbines
are generating the first thing we're

126
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
are generating the first thing we're
 

127
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,789
are generating the first thing we're
going to measure is speed we're going to

128
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:51,799
going to measure is speed we're going to
 

129
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,630
going to measure is speed we're going to
take our speed meter and snap it right

130
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
take our speed meter and snap it right
 

131
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,709
take our speed meter and snap it right
on top like that let's see here stick

132
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:55,719
on top like that let's see here stick
 

133
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:03,069
on top like that let's see here stick
our vacuum up to the side in three two

134
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:03,079

 

135
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,429

come

136
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439

 

137
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,790

on there we

138
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:07,800
on there we
 

139
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,350
on there we
go 2,000 look at

140
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,360

 

141
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,750

that it's

142
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:18,760

 

143
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,270

spinning all right what do we got 2560

144
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,280
spinning all right what do we got 2560
 

145
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,710
spinning all right what do we got 2560
RPM that's rotations per minute which

146
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
RPM that's rotations per minute which
 

147
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,350
RPM that's rotations per minute which
isn't bad but we can conduct a quick

148
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,360
isn't bad but we can conduct a quick
 

149
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,910
isn't bad but we can conduct a quick
torque test with just a tire actually

150
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
torque test with just a tire actually
 

151
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,910
torque test with just a tire actually
that'll add a little bit of weight to it

152
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:28,920
that'll add a little bit of weight to it
 

153
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:40,270
that'll add a little bit of weight to it
too which should be nice

154
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,280

 

155
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,030

this thing has absolutely zero torque so

156
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,040
this thing has absolutely zero torque so
 

157
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,229
this thing has absolutely zero torque so
I'm going to give power a 1 out of 10

158
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
I'm going to give power a 1 out of 10
 

159
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,070
I'm going to give power a 1 out of 10
speed we got 2560 I'm going to give that

160
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
speed we got 2560 I'm going to give that
 

161
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,430
speed we got 2560 I'm going to give that
an 8 out of 10 cuz that's pretty good

162
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
an 8 out of 10 cuz that's pretty good
 

163
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,309
an 8 out of 10 cuz that's pretty good
and electricity generated zero because

164
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
and electricity generated zero because
 

165
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,550
and electricity generated zero because
it doesn't have enough torque to

lot of torque and in this case it

430
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
lot of torque and in this case it
 

431
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,589
lot of torque and in this case it
doesn't generate that much energy the

thought was let's take an axle and a 2x2

464
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
thought was let's take an axle and a 2x2

466
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:18,840
brick and now we can stick this guy
 

467
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,189
brick and now we can stick this guy
right in here except it's just too big

468
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
right in here except it's just too big
 

469
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,790
right in here except it's just too big
for the opening of the

472
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:26,440

which is a little Lego tire and if you

476
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
which is a little Lego tire and if you
 

477
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,670
which is a little Lego tire and if you
you put a gear inside of it it expands

478
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
you put a gear inside of it it expands
 

479
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,510
you put a gear inside of it it expands
just enough and also gives us an axle

480
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
just enough and also gives us an axle
 

481
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,869
just enough and also gives us an axle
attachment point and then we find

482
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:34,879
attachment point and then we find
 

483
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,670
attachment point and then we find
something to go around that piece as the

484
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
something to go around that piece as the
 

485
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,189
something to go around that piece as the

on here then we can put our next disc

488
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
on here then we can put our next disc
 

489
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,869
on here then we can put our next disc
that isn't broken right on top of there

490
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:43,879
that isn't broken right on top of there
 

491
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,469
that isn't broken right on top of there
and we can do that one more time for the

492
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:45,479
and we can do that one more time for the
 

493
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,270
and we can do that one more time for the
final disc here check out that spacing

494
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
final disc here check out that spacing
 

495
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,230
final disc here check out that spacing
that is like almost perfect now we just

496
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,240
that is like almost perfect now we just
 

497
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,390
that is like almost perfect now we just
lack the air exit so we're going to have

498
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,400
lack the air exit so we're going to have
 

499
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,749
lack the air exit so we're going to have
to drill holes in a few

500
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:54,759

 

501
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,790

discs hopefully the air should be able

502
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
discs hopefully the air should be able
 

503
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,869
discs hopefully the air should be able
to flow through there now we need to

504
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:57,879
to flow through there now we need to
 

505
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,629
to flow through there now we need to
build a housing for this out of Lego

506
00:07:59,629 --> 00:07:59,639
build a housing for this out of Lego
 

507
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,070
build a housing for this out of Lego
with one entrance and then we need to

508
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,080
with one entrance and then we need to
 

509
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,280
with one entrance and then we need to
build the exit right over this

510
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,290
build the exit right over this
 

511
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,710
build the exit right over this

think it turned out pretty cool actually

528
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
think it turned out pretty cool actually
 

529
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,830
think it turned out pretty cool actually
we got our shiny discs on the inside and

530
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
we got our shiny discs on the inside and
 

531
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,029
we got our shiny discs on the inside and
hopefully those should give us some

532
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:26,039
hopefully those should give us some
 

533
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,950
hopefully those should give us some
pretty good RPM also since the discs are

534
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:27,960
pretty good RPM also since the discs are
 

535
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,149
pretty good RPM also since the discs are
so heavy I'm thinking it'll give us some

536
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:29,159
so heavy I'm thinking it'll give us some
 

537
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,630
so heavy I'm thinking it'll give us some
good torque too let's see how fast this

538
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640

 

539
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,230

goes

540
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
goes
 

541
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,550
goes
wa what happened yeah we might have

542
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
wa what happened yeah we might have
 

543
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,029
wa what happened yeah we might have
broken it that's what you get when you

544
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:40,039
broken it that's what you get when you
 

545
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,269
broken it that's what you get when you
engineer things out of rubber and

546
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
engineer things out of rubber and
 

547
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,990
engineer things out of rubber and
plastic I think the rubber bands move

548
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,000
plastic I think the rubber bands move
 

549
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,790
plastic I think the rubber bands move
that's not good we're going to have to

550
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:43,800
that's not good we're going to have to
 

551
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,670
that's not good we're going to have to
basically glue these discs onto the axle

552
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
basically glue these discs onto the axle
 

553
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,870
basically glue these discs onto the axle
because right now the axle is just

554
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
because right now the axle is just
 

555
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,150
because right now the axle is just
spinning while the discs

556
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,160
spinning while the discs
 

557
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,790
spinning while the discs
aren't all right here we go see how much

558
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:51,800
aren't all right here we go see how much
 

559
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,110
aren't all right here we go see how much
power we can generate if

560
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,120
power we can generate if
 

561
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,190
power we can generate if
any oh dang look at

562
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200
any oh dang look at
 

563
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,630
any oh dang look at
that dud dude this has got some good

564
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
that dud dude this has got some good
 

565
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,190
that dud dude this has got some good
torque to be able to spin that motor now

566
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,200
torque to be able to spin that motor now
 

567
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,509
torque to be able to spin that motor now
I'm kind of curious how much power we

568
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
I'm kind of curious how much power we
 

569
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,790
I'm kind of curious how much power we
can generate

570
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:05,800
can generate
 

571
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,350
can generate
here it's spinning really fast that's

572
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,360
here it's spinning really fast that's
 

573
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,590
here it's spinning really fast that's
for

574
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,600

 

575
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,150

sure wo just with that we've already

576
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,160
sure wo just with that we've already
 

577
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,550
sure wo just with that we've already
built up 8 volts we can take that power

578
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,560
built up 8 volts we can take that power
 

579
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,430
built up 8 volts we can take that power
we just generated with our Tesla turbine

580
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
we just generated with our Tesla turbine
 

581
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,790
we just generated with our Tesla turbine
and put it onto our motor and we can see

582
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:19,800
and put it onto our motor and we can see
 

583
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,590
and put it onto our motor and we can see
how much power that is let's

584
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:22,600
how much power that is let's
 

585
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,350
how much power that is let's
see okay so it wasn't that much power

586
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
see okay so it wasn't that much power
 

587
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,949
see okay so it wasn't that much power
but it ran the motor that that's cool

588
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
but it ran the motor that that's cool
 

589
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,389
but it ran the motor that that's cool
right I'm going to test the RPM one more

590
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
right I'm going to test the RPM one more
 

591
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:39,509
right I'm going to test the RPM one more
time here let's see how fast we can get

592
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519

 

593
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,710

it it's still going we maxed out the RPM

594
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:43,720
it it's still going we maxed out the RPM
 

595
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,750
it it's still going we maxed out the RPM
that is insane let's try it with a tire

596
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
that is insane let's try it with a tire
 

597
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:55,550
that is insane let's try it with a tire
on the front too so let's check this

598
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:55,560

 

599
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,590

out did you see the tire expand dude

600
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:58,600
out did you see the tire expand dude
 

601
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,550
out did you see the tire expand dude
Tesla turbines all right oh God Tesla

602
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
Tesla turbines all right oh God Tesla
 

603
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,990
Tesla turbines all right oh God Tesla
turbines are dope I'm going to say 10

604
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
turbines are dope I'm going to say 10
 

605
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,110
turbines are dope I'm going to say 10
out of 10 RPM because we maxed it out

606
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,120
out of 10 RPM because we maxed it out
 

607
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,630
out of 10 RPM because we maxed it out
we'll give electricity 10 out of 10 as

608
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,640
we'll give electricity 10 out of 10 as
 

609
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,190
we'll give electricity 10 out of 10 as
well cuz that built up to 8 volts like

610
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
well cuz that built up to 8 volts like
 

611
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,550
well cuz that built up to 8 volts like
really fast and then for torque I'm

612
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
really fast and then for torque I'm
 

613
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,710
really fast and then for torque I'm
going to honestly just give this like

614
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:09,720
going to honestly just give this like
 

615
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,430
going to honestly just give this like
an8 out of 10 that's not bad I'd

616
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
an8 out of 10 that's not bad I'd
 

617
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,110
an8 out of 10 that's not bad I'd
arguably say the Tesla turbine is the

618
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
arguably say the Tesla turbine is the
 

619
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,470
arguably say the Tesla turbine is the
best one so far it's going to be hard to

620
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
best one so far it's going to be hard to
 

621
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,470
best one so far it's going to be hard to
outdo this one honestly the next turbine

622
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
outdo this one honestly the next turbine
 

623
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,190
outdo this one honestly the next turbine
I want to build is a steam powered

624
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,200
I want to build is a steam powered
 

625
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,710
I want to build is a steam powered
turbine and I want to clarify this is

626
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:19,720
turbine and I want to clarify this is
 

627
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,110
turbine and I want to clarify this is
not a steam engine so I've got a bunch

628
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
not a steam engine so I've got a bunch
 

629
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,470
not a steam engine so I've got a bunch
of Lego propellers here and each one of

630
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
of Lego propellers here and each one of
 

631
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,750
of Lego propellers here and each one of
them is a little bit different the

632
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
them is a little bit different the
 

633
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,790
them is a little bit different the
problem is most of the good ones don't

634
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:25,800
problem is most of the good ones don't
 

635
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,870
problem is most of the good ones don't
have an axle without an axle we can't

636
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:27,880
have an axle without an axle we can't
 

637
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,790
have an axle without an axle we can't
actually generate any power so I think

638
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:29,800
actually generate any power so I think
 

639
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,110
actually generate any power so I think
we're going to have to design our own to

640
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
we're going to have to design our own to
 

641
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,470
we're going to have to design our own to
actually generate our steam I bought

642
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
actually generate our steam I bought
 

643
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,389
actually generate our steam I bought
this steam cleaner which has this little

644
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
this steam cleaner which has this little
 

645
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,069
this steam cleaner which has this little
nozzle that'll shoot out steam super

nozzle that'll shoot out steam super
 

647
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,430
nozzle that'll shoot out steam super
duper fast thing about this though is

648
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
duper fast thing about this though is
 

649
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,030
duper fast thing about this though is
that the steam is really hot don't do

650
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
that the steam is really hot don't do
 

651
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,710
that the steam is really hot don't do
this at

vacuum powered one we actually need some

658
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:49,320
vacuum powered one we actually need some
 

659
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,910
vacuum powered one we actually need some
flaps instead of blades and then

660
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:50,920
flaps instead of blades and then
 

661
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,470
flaps instead of blades and then
hopefully what we can do is take these

662
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
hopefully what we can do is take these
 

663
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,150
hopefully what we can do is take these
and turn them into a propeller and we

664
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
and turn them into a propeller and we
 

665
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,870
and turn them into a propeller and we
kind of connect them at Angles all

666
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:55,880
kind of connect them at Angles all
 

667
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,310
kind of connect them at Angles all
around a little Central thing then we

668
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:57,320
around a little Central thing then we
 

669
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,509
around a little Central thing then we
should have those Scoops where the air

670
00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:58,519
should have those Scoops where the air
 

671
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,710
should have those Scoops where the air
will fit I think we take one of these

672
00:10:59,710 --> 00:10:59,720
will fit I think we take one of these
 

673
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,430
will fit I think we take one of these
little wheel pieces it has six holes in

674
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
little wheel pieces it has six holes in
 

675
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,470
little wheel pieces it has six holes in
it so what we can do is add some of

676
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:03,480
it so what we can do is add some of
 

677
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,269
it so what we can do is add some of
these pieces then we can add our little

678
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
these pieces then we can add our little
 

679
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,389
these pieces then we can add our little
bars and then add our blades to the

680
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:07,399
bars and then add our blades to the
 

681
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,870
bars and then add our blades to the
outside of that then just duplicate this

682
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:09,880
outside of that then just duplicate this
 

683
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,629
outside of that then just duplicate this
one more time with the flags upside down

684
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:11,639
one more time with the flags upside down
 

685
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,269
one more time with the flags upside down
we can sandwich them

686
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:14,279
we can sandwich them
 

687
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,910
we can sandwich them
together that is actually pretty cool

688
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:16,920
together that is actually pretty cool
 

689
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,069
together that is actually pretty cool
let's give that a

690
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079

 

691
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,710

guys actually folded over but we can use

694
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720

695
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,509

a couple of these clips on the inside of

696
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:28,519
a couple of these clips on the inside of
 

697
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,389
a couple of these clips on the inside of
the pieces stop them from moving around

698
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:31,399
the pieces stop them from moving around
 

699
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,310
the pieces stop them from moving around
now these guys can't move over anymore I

700
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,320
now these guys can't move over anymore I
 

701
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,389
now these guys can't move over anymore I
think we can just build up a simple

to test this thing

708
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:39,800

 

709
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,949

out so here we have our finished design

so we can actually shoot the steam in

718
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
so we can actually shoot the steam in
 

719
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,110
so we can actually shoot the steam in

engine this one worked really really
 

783
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,350
engine this one worked really really
well so I'd give it a 2 out of 10 on

784
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:08,360
well so I'd give it a 2 out of 10 on

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,430
well so I'd give it a 2 out of 10 on
power a 10 out of 10 on speed and then

786
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:10,440
power a 10 out of 10 on speed and then
 

787
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,230
power a 10 out of 10 on speed and then
maybe like a 5 out of 10 on electricity

788
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
maybe like a 5 out of 10 on electricity
 

789

that was pretty cool the final build is
going to be even cooler cuz I'm going to

going to be even cooler cuz I'm going to
 

797
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,430
going to be even cooler cuz I'm going to
build an air powered turbine but instead

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,480
because that'd be super lame I'm going
 

803
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,310

fan so the first thing we need is the
 

807
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,470
fan so the first thing we need is the
actual fan that's going to go on the

808
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
actual fan that's going to go on the
 

809
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,030
actual fan that's going to go on the
front of the jet engine so I have these

810
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,040
front of the jet engine so I have these
 

811
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,670
front of the jet engine so I have these
little propellers here if we put a bunch

812
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
little propellers here if we put a bunch
 

813
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,030
little propellers here if we put a bunch
of these in the circle and then attach

814
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
of these in the circle and then attach
 

815
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,430
of these in the circle and then attach
them together giving each one a little

816
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:34,440
them together giving each one a little
 

817
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,829
them together giving each one a little
bit of an angle that should let enough

818
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
bit of an angle that should let enough
 

819
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,590
bit of an angle that should let enough
air into the engine to actually make it

820
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
air into the engine to actually make it
 

821
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,870
air into the engine to actually make it
work and since Lego is not fireproof

822
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:39,880
work and since Lego is not fireproof
 

823
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,790
work and since Lego is not fireproof
we're not actually going to be

824
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
we're not actually going to be
 

825
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,269
we're not actually going to be
combusting fuel inside this thing we're

826
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:42,279
combusting fuel inside this thing we're
 

827
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,310
combusting fuel inside this thing we're
just going to build it up to look like a

828
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:43,320
just going to build it up to look like a
 

829
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,590
just going to build it up to look like a
jet engine and then see if it can

830
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:44,600
jet engine and then see if it can
 

831
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,230
jet engine and then see if it can
generate power so I attached all these

832
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
generate power so I attached all these
 

833
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,790
generate power so I attached all these
to these little spider pieces because

834
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:47,800
to these little spider pieces because
 

835
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,509
to these little spider pieces because
they have eight connections and if we

836
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
they have eight connections and if we
 

837
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,350
they have eight connections and if we
sandwich two together that will give us

838
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
sandwich two together that will give us
 

839
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,910
sandwich two together that will give us
our shape but these things all being

840
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:52,920
our shape but these things all being
 

841
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,230
our shape but these things all being
attached to hinges so they're super

842
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
attached to hinges so they're super
 

843
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,110
attached to hinges so they're super
flimsy but we can connect a bunch of

844
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,120
flimsy but we can connect a bunch of
 

845
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,670
flimsy but we can connect a bunch of
these together and that gives us eight

846
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
these together and that gives us eight
 

847
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,509
these together and that gives us eight
connections and then we connect these to

848
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
connections and then we connect these to
 

849
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,350
connections and then we connect these to
that and then do another one underneath

850
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
that and then do another one underneath
 

851
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,470
that and then do another one underneath
it this might be

852
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480

 

853
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,030

it here we have our finished propeller

854
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
it here we have our finished propeller
 

855
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,310
it here we have our finished propeller
design I'm going to put this little guy

856
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
design I'm going to put this little guy
 

857
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,150
design I'm going to put this little guy
on the top here to cap everything

858
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,160
on the top here to cap everything
 

859
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,829
on the top here to cap everything
together and finish off the front of it

860
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
together and finish off the front of it
 

861
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:15,910
together and finish off the front of it
for the housing for this we're going to

862
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
for the housing for this we're going to
 

863
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,629
for the housing for this we're going to
need a big circle and I'm going to build

864
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:17,639
need a big circle and I'm going to build
 

865
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,269
need a big circle and I'm going to build
that using hinges and plates so if we

866
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
that using hinges and plates so if we
 

867
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,550
that using hinges and plates so if we
connect a bunch of these guys end to end

868
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
connect a bunch of these guys end to end
 

869
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,590
connect a bunch of these guys end to end
we should have a big enough

870
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600

 

871
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,509

Circle we just have to cover this in a

872
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
Circle we just have to cover this in a
 

873
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,310
Circle we just have to cover this in a
bunch of plates and tiles to complete it

874
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,320
bunch of plates and tiles to complete it
 

875
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,069
bunch of plates and tiles to complete it
and make it look like a jet engine then

876
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:29,079
and make it look like a jet engine then
 

877
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,189
and make it look like a jet engine then
we'll just have to find a way to attach

878
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:30,199
we'll just have to find a way to attach
 

879
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:36,590
we'll just have to find a way to attach
our turbine to the

880
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:36,600

 

881
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,670

inside so basically I just built this up

882
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:38,680
inside so basically I just built this up
 

883
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,230
inside so basically I just built this up
using some wedge plates and a bunch of

884
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
using some wedge plates and a bunch of
 

885
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,310
using some wedge plates and a bunch of
tiles on the outside to give it a smooth

886
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
tiles on the outside to give it a smooth
 

887
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,829
tiles on the outside to give it a smooth
finish and then to lock that together so

888
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
finish and then to lock that together so
 

889
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,310
finish and then to lock that together so
doesn't fall apart I have some Technic

890
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
doesn't fall apart I have some Technic
 

891
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,069
doesn't fall apart I have some Technic
running through the center of it here so

892
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:47,079
running through the center of it here so
 

893
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,470
running through the center of it here so
now we can install the propeller on the

894
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
now we can install the propeller on the
 

895
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,910
now we can install the propeller on the
inside of this so it just goes right

896
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
inside of this so it just goes right
 

897
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,790
inside of this so it just goes right
into there and Spins and then if we're

898
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:51,800
into there and Spins and then if we're
 

899
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,189
into there and Spins and then if we're
talking about like a turbo fan jet

900
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
talking about like a turbo fan jet
 

901
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,749
talking about like a turbo fan jet
engine there's several other propellers

902
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:54,759
engine there's several other propellers
 

903
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,030
engine there's several other propellers
inside it to compress the

904
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,040

 

905
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,910

air the last thing I'm going to add to

906
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
air the last thing I'm going to add to
 

907
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,389
air the last thing I'm going to add to
this is just a simple After Burner on

908
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:01,399
this is just a simple After Burner on
 

909
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,829
this is just a simple After Burner on
the back and then we'll actually test

910
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:02,839
the back and then we'll actually test
 

911
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,069
the back and then we'll actually test
this thing out and see how much power I

912
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
this thing out and see how much power I
 

913
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,550
this thing out and see how much power I
can generate all right our final turbine

914
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:07,560
can generate all right our final turbine
 

915
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,670
can generate all right our final turbine
I've actually built this one with a

916
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:08,680
I've actually built this one with a
 

917
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,189
I've actually built this one with a
special feature which is it not being

918
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
special feature which is it not being
 

919
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,910
special feature which is it not being
completely done so it has like a cutaway

920
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:12,920
completely done so it has like a cutaway
 

921
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,030
completely done so it has like a cutaway
so you can actually see the inside of

922
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
so you can actually see the inside of
 

923
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,509
so you can actually see the inside of
what's going on we have all of the

924
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:16,519
what's going on we have all of the
 

925
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,790
what's going on we have all of the
propellers which can spin freely also

926
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
propellers which can spin freely also
 

927
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,629
propellers which can spin freely also
added in these little igniters so in a

928
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
added in these little igniters so in a
 

929
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,749
added in these little igniters so in a
real jet engine the fuel would go

930
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:22,759
real jet engine the fuel would go
 

931
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,629
real jet engine the fuel would go
through these and be ignited and mixed

932
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
through these and be ignited and mixed
 

933
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,389
through these and be ignited and mixed
with the air that's a dumb down version

934
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
with the air that's a dumb down version
 

935
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,749
with the air that's a dumb down version
but essentially how it works and to

936
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:27,759
but essentially how it works and to
 

937
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,189
but essentially how it works and to
actually have enough air coming into

938
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
actually have enough air coming into
 

939
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,629
actually have enough air coming into
this so we can power it I'm going to use

940
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
this so we can power it I'm going to use
 

941
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,189
this so we can power it I'm going to use
a leaf blower first let's see how much

942
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:32,199
a leaf blower first let's see how much
 

943
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,870
a leaf blower first let's see how much
electricity this can generate our

944
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:33,880
electricity this can generate our
 

945
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,990
electricity this can generate our
voltage meter broke so to measure how

946
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
voltage meter broke so to measure how
 

947
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,110
voltage meter broke so to measure how
much power is coming out of this we're

948
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
much power is coming out of this we're
 

949
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,990
much power is coming out of this we're
going to start with the

950
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,000
going to start with the
 

951
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,030
going to start with the
lights there's 10%

952
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040

 

953
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,870

power 20%

954
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:47,880
power 20%
 

955
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,110
power 20%
power it's spinning are the lights

956
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,120
power it's spinning are the lights
 

957
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,760
power it's spinning are the lights
lighting up not quite one more

958
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:55,770
lighting up not quite one more
 

959
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,150
lighting up not quite one more
[Applause]

960
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,160

 

961
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,110

oh we're getting light that's 80%

962
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120

 

963
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,910

power so for power generation we have

964
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
power so for power generation we have
 

965
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,910
power so for power generation we have
absolutely 0% so that's 0 out of 10 for

966
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:10,920
absolutely 0% so that's 0 out of 10 for
 

967
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,629
absolutely 0% so that's 0 out of 10 for
