========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this Snake problem. So, the snake is at (1,7) and needs to get to the apple at (4,7). The current direction is "UP," but wait, that might be a bit confusing because the head is at (1,7), which is on the same row as the apple.

First, I'll note down all the given information:

- Head position: (1,7)
- Current direction: "UP"
- Body cells: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]
- Apple position: (4,7)

The snake's body is extending downward from the head. So, the current state of the snake is like a vertical line starting at (1,7) and going down to (1,4). The apple is three units to the right on the same row.

Since the apple is directly to the right, I might think moving right would be straightforward. But I need to consider the movement rules carefully.

The current direction is "UP," which means if I choose a new direction that's not opposite (like "DOWN"), it should be allowed. So from "UP", possible next directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again? Wait, no—the movement rule says you can't reverse. So if the current direction is UP, you can't go DOWN next, and vice versa.

Wait, actually, the rules say: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP," you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So from UP, I can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or stay in UP. But since moving UP from (1,7) would take me to (1,8), which is outside the grid because y ranges from 0 to 9, right? Wait no—wait, the grid goes from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. So if current head is (1,7), moving UP would take it to (1,8). Since y can be up to 9, that's allowed. But wait, does the movement cause a collision?

Wait, no—if I move UP from (1,7), new_head is (1,8). The body is [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. So after moving, the body becomes [old head (1,7)] + current body. Then, if not eating apple, tail is removed.

But wait, in this case, moving UP would take us to a new cell that's currently unoccupied because the body is behind. But I need to check for collisions with any BODYi except possibly the tail when it moves.

Wait, but the apple is at (4,7). So maybe moving right is better. Let me think about the path.

If I choose "RIGHT" as the first move, new_head becomes (2,7). That's within bounds and not occupied by any body cells except if the tail is going to move. Since the body is behind, but when I move, I need to check if the new head collides with any BODYi.

Looking at the body list: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. So from (1,7) moving right to (2,7)—that's not in the body. So no collision there.

After moving RIGHT, the body becomes [old head (1,7)] + current body [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)], making it four cells. Then since we're not eating an apple yet, the tail (1,4) will be removed. But wait, after this move, the new_head is at (2,7). Next step would be to continue moving right.

Wait, but in each move, I have to plan a sequence of directions that gets me from (1,7) to (4,7). The Manhattan distance is 3 units in x-direction, same y. So I need three "RIGHT" moves.

But let's think step by step:

Current state:
Head: (1,7)
Body: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]
Direction: UP

If I choose to move RIGHT first, then the new_head is (2,7). Then body becomes [ (1,7) ] + [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ], making it [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. Since we didn't eat the apple, tail is removed: now body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].

Next move: from (2,7), current direction is now RIGHT. Next direction can be any except LEFT? Wait no—the rule says you can't reverse. So if I'm moving RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT. But since we're going for the apple at (4,7), we need to continue moving RIGHT.

But wait—current direction after first move is RIGHT. Next moves should continue with RIGHT or something else that doesn't reverse.

Wait, no—the initial current direction was UP. So when choosing the next direction, from UP, I can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again (since DOWN would be reversing). But moving UP again might not make sense as it's away from the apple.

Alternatively, after first move to (2,7) with direction RIGHT, then we can keep moving RIGHT until reaching (4,7).

But let me simulate this:

Move 1: Direction RIGHT
- New head: (2,7)
- Body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]
- No collision because new_head is not in body after shifting.

Move 2: Direction RIGHT again
- New head: (3,7)
- Body becomes [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)] (after inserting old head)
- Then remove tail if no apple eaten. Since we're not at apple yet, tail is removed: body is now [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]

Wait, wait—that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify the update steps.

When moving normally (not eating apple):

a. Insert old head into BODY list.
b. Remove last element of BODY.

So after first move:

BODY was [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]
After inserting old head: becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]
Since not eating apple, remove tail (1,4): body is now [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].

So after first move, snake's body is from (1,7) to (1,5). So the new head is at (2,7).

Now, for second move: again RIGHT. New_head = (3,7). Now check collision with body:

BODY is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. The new head is (3,7), which is not in any of these, so no collision.

Update BODY:
Insert old head (2,7) into front: [(2,7)] + current BODY [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) ] → becomes [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]
Since not eating apple, remove tail (1,5): body is now [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)].

Third move: RIGHT again. New_head = (4,7). Now check collision:

BODY is [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. The new head is (4,7), which isn't in any of these except possibly the tail after shift? Wait, no—the collision check is before body shifts.

Wait, according to movement rules:

When computing new_head, you check if it's outside grid or collides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

In this case, after second move, the body is [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. So moving to (3,7) is okay. Now for third move:

new_head = (4,7). Check if it's outside grid? No. Check collision with any BODYi except maybe the tail.

BODY after second move: [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ]

So new_head (4,7) is not in BODY, so safe.

Now, when moving to (4,7), which is the apple's position. So we eat it.

In that case:

a. Insert old head (3,7) into front of BODY → [(3,7)] + [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ] → [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]
b. Since new_head == apple position, we grow: do not remove the tail. So body becomes [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]

So now, the head is at (4,7), and the body follows.

But wait—the apple was at (4,7). Now, after this move, the snake's body has grown by one, so it's longer. But we also need to make sure that after eating, there's at least one legal move next turn.

So after eating, the new head is at (4,7), and the body is [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. So what can be the next direction?

The current direction is RIGHT. Next direction cannot reverse to LEFT.

Looking ahead:

From (4,7), moving UP would take us to (4,8). Is that allowed? Let's see if it causes any collision.

But wait, after eating the apple, the body becomes longer. So from (4,7), next possible moves are UP, RIGHT, or DOWN, but considering direction restrictions.

Wait, no—the current direction after moving to (4,7) is still RIGHT, so next move can't be LEFT.

So options: stay in RIGHT (but that would take us out of grid), or move UP or DOWN.

If we choose UP, new_head = (4,8). The body before shift is [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. So the new head (4,8) isn't in any of these, so no collision. Then, since not eating apple again, we would insert old head and remove tail.

But wait, after eating the apple, our direction is still RIGHT? Or does it change?

Wait, the direction changes based on the move you choose. So if I'm at (4,7) facing RIGHT, to go UP next, that's allowed as long as it's not reversing. Wait, from direction RIGHT, can't reverse to LEFT.

So moving UP is fine. But let me check: after eating, do we need to have a next move? Or are the required moves only up to reaching the apple?

In this problem, I think we just need to provide a sequence of directions that gets the snake to the apple. So maybe three "RIGHT" moves would suffice.

Wait, but each move is a direction change from the current one. Initially, the snake is moving UP, so first move must be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but can't go DOWN). Then, next moves can't reverse.

So step by step:

1. Current direction: UP
   - Next direction options: LEFT, RIGHT, UP

If I choose to move RIGHT first:

Move 1: RIGHT → new head (2,7), body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]

Move 2: Now facing RIGHT, next direction can be RIGHT again, or DOWN or UP? Wait no—current direction is RIGHT, so next cannot be LEFT. So possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN.

But we need to go further right. So move 2: RIGHT → new head (3,7), body becomes [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]

Move 3: Facing RIGHT again, move to (4,7) which is the apple.

At this point, moving to (4,7) eats the apple. Now, we need to ensure that after eating, there's at least one valid next move.

But actually, in the problem statement, it's just about getting to the apple, not necessarily worrying about what happens after. But according to the rules, when you eat an apple, your body grows, so you don't lose the tail.

So perhaps three moves: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

Wait, but initial direction is UP. So first move can be RIGHT or LEFT or UP? Let me think carefully.

If I start at (1,7) facing UP. The possible next directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (since DOWN would reverse).

Option 1: Move RIGHT to (2,7). Then from there, direction is RIGHT, so next moves can be RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

But if we continue moving RIGHT two more times, that's three steps, which gets us to the apple. So:

First move: RIGHT → (2,7)
Second move: RIGHT → (3,7)
Third move: RIGHT → (4,7)

That seems correct. Each time, checking for collision and grid boundaries.

But wait—what if after moving RIGHT once, the body's position causes a problem?

Wait, after first move:

Body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. Head is at (2,7). So no overlap.

Second move: to (3,7), body becomes [ (2,7), (1,7), (1,6) ]

Third move: to (4,7), which is apple. No collision with body because new_head isn't in [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)].

So this sequence should work.

Alternatively, what if I try moving UP first?

From (1,7) facing UP, moving UP takes me to (1,8). That's allowed, and the body becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] but then tail is removed because we didn't eat apple. So body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].

Now, facing UP, next move can be UP again or LEFT/RIGHT? No—can't reverse DOWN.

If I choose UP again, to (1,9). That's allowed. But that takes me away from the apple.

Alternatively, from (1,8) facing UP, if I decide to move RIGHT:

Move 2: RIGHT → (2,8). Now check collision with body [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. New head is at (2,8), which isn't in body. Then body becomes [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6) ].

But this path seems longer and not directly towards the apple.

So probably moving RIGHT each time is more efficient.

Another consideration: after eating the apple at (4,7), the snake's body extends to include (3,7). So the next move must ensure that we don't reverse direction into the body.

But since the problem only requires getting to the apple, maybe just three RIGHT moves are sufficient.

Wait, but initial direction is UP. So first move can't be DOWN (since it would reverse). So from UP, possible first moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

If I choose to go RIGHT first, then that's correct.

So the sequence of directions should be:

1. RIGHT
2. RIGHT
3. RIGHT

This will take the snake from (1,7) → (2,7) → (3,7) → (4,7), eating the apple at the last step.

I think this is a valid solution.
</think>

The snake needs to move right three times to reach the apple without colliding with its body. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial State:** The head is at (1,7) moving UP. Body cells are [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].
2. **First Move:** Change direction to RIGHT, moving the head to (2,7). No collision as this cell isn't part of the body post-shift. The body updates to [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].
3. **Second Move:** Continue in direction RIGHT, moving the head to (3,7). Again, no collision with updated body cells [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6)].
4. **Third Move:** Final move RIGHT to (4,7), which is where the apple is located. Since this is the apple's position, the snake grows without losing the tail.

**Answer:**

The snake should make three consecutive moves to the right.
