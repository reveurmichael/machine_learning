========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to help plan a path for this snake to reach the apple without dying. Let me start by understanding all the given information.

The head is at (8,5), which is near the bottom-left corner of the 10x10 grid since coordinates increase towards the top-right. The current direction is UP, meaning the next move would be to (8,6). But wait, I should check if that's possible without colliding.

The apple is at (7,7), which is up and to the left of the head. So, moving LEFT once and UP twice seems necessary. However, since the snake can't reverse direction immediately on the first move, maybe it needs a slight detour.

Looking at the body cells provided: [(8,4)]. That means right behind the head is (8,4), which is directly below. The tail would be somewhere else based on the current state. So when the snake moves UP, the new_head becomes (8,6). I need to check if this cell is occupied by any body segment except maybe the tail.

Wait, currently, the body list is [(8,4)], so only the head and the next segment are at (8,5) and (8,4). If we move UP, new_head would be (8,6), which isn't in the body. So that seems okay. Then, since it's not eating the apple yet, after moving, the snake grows by removing the tail.

So the initial move is UP to (8,6). Now, updating the body: insert (8,5) at the front and remove the last element which was (8,4), so now the body becomes [(8,5)]. Then set HEAD to (8,6).

Next moves need to be calculated step by step. The next direction would likely continue towards the apple but ensuring no collisions.

Wait, from (8,6), moving UP again would take us to (8,7). But our target is (7,7), so maybe we should start moving LEFT and then adjust as needed.

Alternatively, considering that after each move, the body grows or shifts, it's important to ensure there's always space for the tail to move unless eating the apple.

So let's outline a possible path:

1. Move UP: new_head (8,6). Body becomes [(8,5)]. Not eating apple.
2. Next direction is probably LEFT since we're closer to the apple in x-direction. So move LEFT from (8,6) to (7,6). Check if this cell is free.

At (7,6), that's not occupied by any body segments as of now because our current snake positions are [(8,5)] after first move. Then, inserting (8,6) at front and removing last element which was none? Wait no—after the first move, the body list becomes [ (8,5) ].

Wait, initial body is [(8,4)], so when we move UP to (8,6), the new head is (8,6). Then the body positions are updated: insert old head (8,5) at front and remove last element which was (8,4). So now, the body becomes [ (8,5) ]. So for the next move:

Current head is (8,6). The current direction was UP. Now we can't reverse immediately, so next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

Moving LEFT: new_head would be (7,6).

Check if this cell is empty—since our body after first move is [(8,5)], and the tail was (8,4) which has moved to (8,5). So yes, (7,6) is free. So proceed.

Now update the snake: insert (8,6) at front of body [ (8,5) ], making new body [ (8,6), (8,5) ]. Since not eating apple, remove last element—tail becomes (8,5). Now the full S is [(7,6) head, (8,6) body1]. But wait, no—it's supposed to be [HEAD, BODY1, ...]. So after inserting new_head at front and removing tail, the new body list would become [ (8,6), (8,5) ].

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-examine:

After moving UP: head is (8,6), body becomes [(8,5)]. Next move LEFT to (7,6):

Insert old head (8,6) at front of body, so new body list before removing tail would be [ (8,6), (8,5) ]. Since not eating apple, remove last element—tail is removed. So the body becomes [(8,6)].

Wait no—that can't be right because the snake's length should stay consistent unless it eats the apple.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body list updates.

Wait in movement update rule step 3:

a. Insert old head at front of body (head becomes new head).

b. If not eating, remove last element as tail moves; else grow without removing.

So after moving UP to (8,6), the snake's body was [(8,5)]. So when we move LEFT to (7,6):

- new_head is (7,6). Check if it collides with any body segments except the current tail. The current body is [ (8,5) ]. So (7,6) is free.

Then step 3:

a. Insert old head (8,6) at front of body [(8,5)] → new body list becomes [ (8,6), (8,5) ].

b. Since not eating apple, remove last element—tail is removed. So the body becomes [ (8,6) ]. So now the snake's S is:

HEAD: (7,6)
BODY1: (8,6)

Wait that would make the snake only two segments? But it was previously of length 2 after first move.

Hmm perhaps I need to think about this more carefully. The initial body list is [ (8,4) ]. So when moving UP:

- new_head is (8,5). Insert into front → body becomes [ (8,5), (8,4) ].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element—tail moves, so the snake's S becomes [(8,6) as head, (8,5)].

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it step by step for each move:

Move 1: UP from (8,5) to (8,6). Check collision with body segments except tail? After the first move, the body was [(8,4)], so moving to (8,6)—no collision.

Then update:

a. Insert old head (8,5) at front → body becomes [ (8,5), (8,4) ].
b. Remove last element as not eating apple → new body is [ (8,5) ].

So now S = [(8,6) head, (8,5)].

Move 2: Current direction was UP; can't reverse immediately, so possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

Moving LEFT to (7,6). Check collision with current body [ (8,5) ]—no issue.

Update:

a. Insert old head (8,6) at front → body becomes [ (8,6), (8,5) ].
b. Remove last element since not eating apple → new body is [ (8,6) ].

Now S = [(7,6), (8,6)].

Move 3: Current direction was LEFT; can't reverse to RIGHT immediately? Or wait, no—current direction after first move is... Wait the initial direction was UP. After moving UP, direction remains UP unless changed by a move command that's not reversing.

Wait I think each move has its own direction, but you have to follow movement rules for directions. So after Move 1: direction was UP; if we move LEFT in next step, it changes from UP to LEFT as per the action taken.

But according to the problem statement, current direction is given—so initial direction is UP, and after each move command, the snake's direction may change based on new head movement. So actually, the direction isn't fixed unless you keep moving in that direction without reversing.

Wait perhaps the direction can be changed by turning left or right when possible.

But according to the rules:

1. Cannot reverse direction on first move.

2. Valid directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT; no immediate reversals.

So from initial UP, next move can't be DOWN immediately.

Therefore, after moving UP once (from (8,5) to (8,6)), next move could be LEFT, RIGHT, or still UP—but probably better to change direction towards the apple.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's focus on each step carefully.

After Move 2: head is at (7,6), body list after update is [ (8,6) ]—so it's just [(7,6)] as head and no body? Wait that can't be right because the snake should have a body following it.

Wait perhaps I made an error in updating the body. Let me clarify:

The initial state before Move 1: S = [ (8,5), ... ] but actually, according to the problem statement, the snake's body is given as [(8,4)], so with head at (8,5). So the full S after moving UP would be [(8,6) (head), (8,5)] because inserting old head and removing tail.

Wait no—body cells are [ (8,4) ], meaning the snake's body is only one segment behind the head. Therefore, when the head moves to (8,6), the new body list becomes:

a. Insert head at front: [(8,6), (8,5)]
b. Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (8,6) ]

So now S is [(8,6)]? That doesn't make sense because the snake can't have only a head with no body segments.

Ah! Wait maybe I misunderstood how the movement works. Let me look again at the problem statement:

"Movement Update Rule 3: If not eating apple... remove tail."

Wait if the snake was initially length 2 (head and one body segment), moving UP from (8,5) to (8,6):

- Insert head → new body list is [ (8,6), (8,5) ]
- Then since it's not eating apple, it removes last element → body becomes [ (8,6) ]

So S = [ (8,6) as head; no body? That can't be—it must have at least the head and one segment.

Wait maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps when moving UP from (8,5), since there was only one body segment behind it [(8,4)], after moving, the new position is such that S becomes [ (8,6) ] with no body?

No, that seems impossible because the snake must have at least two segments unless it's just a head.

Wait perhaps I'm confusing how the movement works. Let me think differently:

If current head is H and body cells are B = [B1, B2,...], then after moving to new_head, S becomes [new_head] followed by all elements of B except last if not eating apple; else add another segment (new_head) before removing last.

Wait no—the problem statement says in step 3:

a. Insert old head at front

b. If not eating, remove tail → so the body is updated to be new_body = [old_head] + current_body[:-1]

So if initial S was [(8,5), (8,4)], after moving UP to (8,6):

new_body becomes [(8,5)] because:

current_body before step 3 is [(8,4)]. Inserting old head (8,5) at front: [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Then since not eating apple, remove tail → new_body = [ (8,5) ]

Therefore, S after move becomes [(8,6) as head; then body is [ (8,5) ]]

But that would mean the snake has two segments: (8,6) and (8,5), which makes sense.

Wait no—after inserting old_head at front and removing tail:

The new_body before step 3b was [(8,5), (8,4)], but since it's not eating apple, we remove last element → new_body becomes [ (8,5) ]

So the snake S after moving is:

[ head: (8,6), body1: (8,5) ]

Which is correct.

Now proceeding to Move 2:

Current direction was UP; next move can't be DOWN immediately. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or still UP—probably better to change towards the apple at (7,7).

So moving LEFT from (8,6) → new_head would be (7,6). Check if this is free.

Looking at current_body: [ (8,5) ]. So yes, it's free. Therefore, proceed.

Update:

a. Insert old head (8,6) at front of body list [(8,5)] → new_body becomes [ (8,6), (8,5) ]

b. Since not eating apple, remove tail → new_body = [ (8,6) ]

Thus S after Move 2 is:

[ head: (7,6), body1: (8,6) ]

Now for Move 3:

Current direction was LEFT; can't reverse to RIGHT immediately.

Next move options are UP, LEFT, or maybe DOWN. But since the apple is above and left of current position, probably better to go UP again towards it.

Move UP from (7,6) → new_head would be (7,5). Check if this cell is free: current_body is [ (8,6) ]—(7,5) isn't in there. So okay.

Update:

a. Insert old head (7,6) at front of body list [(8,6)] → new_body = [ (7,6), (8,6) ]

b. Since not eating apple, remove tail → new_body becomes [ (7,6) ]

Thus S after Move 3 is:

[ (7,5) as head; body1: (7,6) ]

Wait no—after moving UP to (7,5):

Insert old head (7,6) at front of current_body [(8,6)] → new_body before removing tail = [ (7,6), (8,6) ]

Then remove last element since not eating apple → body becomes [ (7,6) ]

So S is [ (7,5), (7,6) ]

Wait that seems a bit confusing.

It's getting complex step by step. Maybe I need to outline the steps more systematically for each move.

But this will take time. Alternatively, perhaps I can see what the direction should be after some moves and plan accordingly.

Another approach is to consider how many segments are in the snake:

Given that initially, S has head at (8,5) and body at (8,4)—so length 2.

Each move keeps the same number of segments unless eating apple, which increases it by one.

So moving UP from (8,5): new_head is (8,6). After step 3:

body becomes [ (8,6), remove tail → so [(8,6)]

Thus S now has two segments: head and body1.

Move LEFT to (7,6):

Insert old head at front → [ (8,6) + current_body = [ (8,5) ]? Wait no—the current_body after first move is [(8,5)]. So moving left:

After inserting old head (8,6), new_body before removing tail is [ (8,6), (8,5) ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (8,6) ]

So S now has two segments again.

This suggests that the snake's length isn't changing unless it grows. So to grow, we need to eat the apple.

But perhaps when moving closer without growing is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe after some steps, the snake can have enough space to move towards the apple in a more efficient way.

I think stepping through each possible move with clear direction changes and ensuring no collisions will lead me to the solution. Let's proceed step by step:

Move 1: Initial head (8,5). Direction UP.

New_head = (8,6). Check if any body segments except tail? Body was [(8,4)], so moving to (8,6) is okay.

Update S:

Insert old head at front → [ (8,6), (8,5) ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element. So body becomes [ (8,6) ]

S after move 1: [(8,6), (8,6)]? Wait no—the snake should have a new head and the previous head as the next segment.

Wait I'm getting confused again. Maybe better to represent S step by step:

Move 0:
- Head: (8,5)
- Body: [ (8,4) ]

S = [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Move 1: Move UP
- New_head = (8,6)
- Check for collision with body except tail: current body is [ (8,4) ] → no collision.
- Insert old head at front of body list → new_body_list = [ (8,5), (8,4) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body_list becomes [ (8,5) ]
- S after move 1: [(8,6), (8,5)]

Move 2: Current head is (8,6). Current direction was UP. Next possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or stay UP.

Let's choose LEFT for now to get closer to the apple at (7,7).

New_head = (7,6)
- Check collision with body [ (8,5) ] → no problem.
- Insert old head (8,6) at front of body list → new_body_list = [ (8,6), (8,5) ]
- Remove last element since not eating apple → body becomes [ (8,6) ]
- S after move 2: [(7,6), (8,6)]

Move 3: Head is (7,6). Current direction was LEFT. Next possible directions are UP, RIGHT.

Let's try UP again towards the apple at (7,5).

New_head = (7,5)
- Check collision with body [ (8,6) ] → no problem.
- Insert old head (7,6) at front of body list → new_body_list = [ (7,6), (8,6) ]
- Remove last element since not eating apple → body becomes [ (7,6) ]
- S after move 3: [(7,5), (7,6)]

Move 4: Head is (7,5). Direction was UP. Can't reverse to DOWN.

Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or UP—probably better to go further left towards the apple's x-coordinate of 7 and y-coordinate of 7.

But current head is at (7,5); moving UP again would take it to (7,6), which we have just vacated. Wait no—actually in move 3, after moving to (7,5) as head:

Wait wait, in move 2: new_head was (7,6). So body list became [ (8,6) ].

After inserting old head at front and removing last element for not eating apple: S becomes [(7,6), ... ?

No—maybe I need to clarify each step again. This is getting quite tangled.

Alternative approach:

Let me define each move with the new_head, insert old head into body, then remove tail if necessary, adjusting the snake's position accordingly.

Move 0:
- Head: (8,5)
- Body: [ (8,4) ]

S = [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Move 1: UP
- new_head = (8,6)
- Check body: only (8,4). No collision.
- Insert head at front → S becomes [(8,6), (8,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element. Wait no—it's the same as before.

Wait wait—if you insert the old head into the current_body list and then remove the tail if it's a non-apple move:

Original S after move 0: [H1, B1] where H1 = (8,5), B1=(8,4).

Move 1:

- new_head = (8,6)
- Check body: only B1 at (8,4). So safe.
- Insert old head H1 into current_body → new_body_list = [H1, B1] → [(8,5), (8,4)]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element. Wait—no—if we didn't eat the apple, which is true here since apple is at (7,7), then after inserting H1, body becomes [H1, B1], and removing tail gives us [H1]

Wait no—that can’t be right because it would leave S as just two segments. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving to a new position, the snake's body is updated by shifting all segments forward, adding new_head at front and trimming last if necessary.

But maybe an alternative way is:

If the apple is not eaten:
- The snake moves into the new_head.
- All previous head positions shift one back, with the first segment being new_head.
- If the number of segments remains same or increases? Wait no—the movement rules say that when moving to a non-apple cell, it's just shifting all segments.

But perhaps the key is: Each move involves:

1. Moving the entire snake one segment forward in the direction chosen.
2. The head moves to new_head position.
3. All body segments follow behind, with the last segment being cut if necessary (to keep same number of segments unless growing).

Wait no—if you’re moving into a non-apple cell, the tail is removed.

So each move:

- The entire snake translates in direction.
- The head moves to new_head.
- Each body segment follows, except that the last segment (tail) is cut if necessary.

But wait, how does this work for segments longer than 2? Because if you have multiple segments, moving into a position where only one of them would be vacated.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving:

If the new_head isn't eaten:
- Insert new_head at front.
- All body positions shift back by one (each previous head becomes next segment).
- If the number of body segments is same as before: remove last segment if necessary to maintain same count.

But this might be getting too complex without a clear algorithm.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider each move step and keep track of the snake's position.

Given that time is limited, perhaps I can plan ahead:

The apple is at (7,7), which is diagonally up-left from starting point. The initial head is at (8,5). To reach there, the snake needs to move 1 cell left (from x=8 to 7) and 2 cells up (y=5 to 6, then 6 to 7).

But each movement step can change one coordinate.

The problem is that moving towards the apple may involve passing through existing body segments unless the snake grows.

Since the initial length is two, perhaps after a few moves when the snake needs to turn or navigate around, it will grow and provide space for the necessary turns.

Alternatively, considering that each time the snake can't eat the apple until it has enough space. So moving towards the apple in such a way that allows growth without collision.

But maybe I should just outline the steps:

1. Move Up: (8,6)
2. Move Left: (7,6) [body now at (8,5)]
3. Next move? Let's see: Now head is (7,6), body is [(8,6)]

We need to go further up towards (7,5). Since current direction was LEFT.

Move 3:

From (7,6), moving UP would take us to (7,7) which is the apple. So if we move UP now, are there any collisions?

Current body: [ (8,6) ]

New_head = (7,7). Check for collision with current_body. Since current_body is [(8,6)], no collision.

So proceed:

- Insert old head at front of body list → new_body_list becomes [ (7,6), (8,6) ]
- Since it's not the apple position yet? Wait—if moving to (7,7), which is the apple, do we have to eat?

Wait in this movement step: if the snake moves into (7,7), that's where the apple is. So in rule 3:

If the new_head equals apple location, then after inserting old head and body, the tail isn't removed.

So for move towards apple:

- Insert old head at front → [ (7,6), (8,6) ]
- Since it's eating the apple, add a new segment:
   - Prepend the new_head to current_body, so new_body = [ (7,6), (8,6) ] + ... no? Wait rule 3 says:

If not eating apple: after inserting old head, remove tail.

But if eating apple, step is slightly different. Rule 1 for when it's on apple:

When on apple location, the snake extends by one more segment—so during movement towards apple, you add a new segment at the end.

Wait no—the rule says:

Movement Update Rule 2: If on apple, remove tail and add another segment in direction of motion.

So if moving to apple position (7,7):

- Insert old head → [ (7,6), ... ]
- Then since it's eating apple, remove tail and add new segment at end?

Wait maybe not. Let me check:

Rule 2 says: If on apple location, after inserting old_head into body list, the snake grows by one in direction of movement.

So when moving towards apple, if you land on it, the body appends a new segment at the end (in direction of motion).

Therefore, for move that results in new_head = apple:

After step 3a: Insert old_head at front → [old_head] + current_body

Then since it's eating, add another segment at the end.

So after moving to apple position, S becomes:

[apple_x, ... , previous tail], and an additional segment in direction of motion.

Wait maybe better:

If on apple:
- Insert old_head into body list (front)
- Remove last element
- Add new segment at end

No, rule says: if on apple, remove tail and add another segment in same direction as movement.

So for example, moving to the right from a position where you just moved left—apples are consumed, so the snake extends further to the right.

But this is perhaps getting too detailed without clear algorithm steps.

Alternatively, given time constraints, I can plan that each move towards apple will involve adding segments when on it, and otherwise maintaining same length.

Therefore, for our case:

Move 1: Up → (8,6)
Move 2: Left → (7,6)
Move 3: Up → (7,5). Check collision with body [(8,6)]—no.
Insert old_head (7,6) at front of [ (8,6) ] → new_body becomes [ (7,6), (8,6) ]
Since not eating apple yet, remove last element? No, because if moving to (7,5), which is not the apple.

Wait no: After inserting old_head at front:

new_body = [ (7,6), (8,6) ]

But snake's length was 2 before move; after inserting head and removing tail, it remains same. So S becomes [(7,5), (7,6)]

Move 4: Now facing towards apple is up again.

New_head = (7,6). But current_body is [ (7,6) ]. Wait no—current_body was:

Wait move 3 resulted in S after moving to (7,5):

S = [(7,5), ... ?

This seems too confusing. Perhaps I need a different approach.

Alternative plan: since the apple is at (7,7), and starting from (8,5). To reach there, head needs to make net movement of 1 left and 2 up.

Assuming that each move can be in any direction as long as no collision, we can calculate steps:

Possible path:

Move UP → (8,6)
Move LEFT → (7,6)
Move UP → (7,5)

Now here's the issue: when at (7,5), body is [(8,6)]

Moving to apple location (7,6) would require moving RIGHT— but then after that.

Wait step by step:

1. Move Up from (8,5) to (8,6)
2. Move Left from (8,6) to (7,6)
3. Now at (7,6). Current body is [ (8,6) ]

If move UP again:

new_head = (7,7)

Check for collision: body has only (8,6), so safe.

Proceeding:
- Insert old head into body → new_body = [(7,6), (8,6)]
- Since moving towards apple and will land on it, add a segment at end.

So after this move:

S becomes [ (7,7) ] + previous body. Wait no—wait the rule says when on apple location, remove tail and add another segment in direction of motion.

Since direction was Up from (7,6) to (7,7), then new segment is added at end in that same up direction.

So after moving:

old_head = (7,6)
current_body before move: [8,6]

new_head = (7,7). Insert old_head into body → [7,6] + [8,6] = [ (7,6), (8,6) ]

Since on apple location, remove tail and add new segment.

So new_body becomes:

After removing last element: [ (7,6) ]

Then add new segment in direction of motion—Up from previous position? Or from current?

Wait rule 2 says when on apple, after inserting old_head into body list, the snake grows by one in direction of movement. So probably adds a new segment at end.

Therefore:

new_body = [ (7,6), (8,6) ] 

But since it's eating apple, we remove last element and add another segment?

Wait rule 2: If on apple location, after inserting old_head into body list, the snake grows by one in direction of movement. So that would be:

After moving to apple position (7,7):

new_body = [ (7,6), (8,6) ] → then remove tail? Wait no—apparently when it eats, it adds a segment.

But maybe more accurate: When on apple location, the snake grows by one in direction of movement. So after moving to apple position and before checking for collision, you grow at end.

Wait I'm getting confused again without proper algorithm steps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that when eating apple, the body appends a new segment at the current head direction. Therefore:

After move 3 (up to (7,7)):

- Insert old_head = (7,6) into body → [ (7,6), (8,6) ]

Since on apple location, add another segment in direction of movement—Up.

So append a new segment at end: So final body becomes [ (7,6), (8,6), (7,7) ]

But wait initial body was [(8,6)], so after inserting head and adding tail:

S is now [(7,7)]? Or does it become three segments?

Wait perhaps when on apple location, the snake grows by one. So from 2 to 3.

Therefore:

After moving to (7,7):

new_body = [ (7,7) ] + current_body after inserting old_head → which is [ (7,6), (8,6) ]

Then add another segment at end in direction of movement—up: so adding (7,8). But apple is only at (7,7), not beyond.

Alternatively, perhaps the growth happens before collision check.

This is getting too tangled without a clear algorithm. Maybe better to accept that given time constraints, moving UP and LEFT towards the apple would eventually reach it after several moves, assuming no obstacles in body.

Therefore, considering all steps:

1. Move Up: (8,5) → (8,6)
2. Move Left: (8,6) → (7,6)
3. Move Up: (7,6) → (7,7) [apple location]

But wait is this possible? After moving to (7,7):

Check if it's the apple position.

If so, after inserting old_head:

new_body = [ (7,6), (8,6) ]

Then since on apple, add a new segment in direction of movement (Up). So final body becomes [ (7,6), (8,6), (7,7) ]?

But the apple is already at (7,7); would that cause collision? Or perhaps after eating, the snake's tail isn't removed.

Wait no—apparently when on apple location, you eat it and grow by one. So if previous body was [(8,6)], inserting old_head gives [ (7,6), (8,6) ], then add new segment at end in direction of movement (Up from (7,6)—so Up is adding y+1). Therefore:

Final position after this move: S = [ (7,6), (8,6), (9,6) ]?

Wait no—direction was Up when moving to apple. From (7,6) to (7,7).

So if on apple location and eating it, you add a segment in same direction as movement, which is Up.

Thus:

new_body = [ (7,6), (8,6) ] + [ (7,7) ]

But wait that would make the snake have three segments at positions (7,6), (8,6), and (9,6). But apple was only at (7,7). So in this case, moving Up from previous position to apple location causes adding a segment.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better represented as:

After inserting old_head into body list:

new_body = [old_head] + current_body

Then if on apple: add another segment at end of new_body.

Thus, for move 3a:

inserting (7,6) into [ (8,6) ] gives [ (7,6), (8,6) ]

Since it's on apple location, add a segment in Up direction → so adding (7,7)

Thus S becomes: [(7,6), (8,6), (7,7)]

But then the next move would be to have segments at those positions.

However, now with three segments:

At position (7,6): head

(8,6): middle

(7,7): tail

Wait no—after adding new segment when on apple: perhaps body becomes [ (7,6), (8,6) ] and then append a new segment at end in direction of movement. So from (7,6) to (7,7). Therefore:

new_body = [ (7,6), (8,6), (7,7) ]

But apple is already at (7,7); perhaps this causes no collision since it's only the tail moving into position.

Alternatively, perhaps when eating, you don't move until after adding segment. This is too vague without clear rules.

Perhaps better to consider that when on apple location, body extends by one in direction of movement, so:

- Move Up from (7,6) to (7,7), then add a new segment at end: making it three segments—head at (7,7), middle at (8,6), tail at another position? Or perhaps head at previous cell and added new.

This is getting too convoluted. Given time constraints, maybe best to proceed with the initial plan:

- Move Up twice
- Then Left once

Which would lead towards apple in three moves: from (8,5) → (8,6) → (8,7) isn't possible since it's a movement of y+1.

Wait no—if moving up each time:

From (8,5): move Up to (8,6)

From there, move Up again? But body has someone at (8,4). So if you move from (8,6), new_head would be (8,7).

But is that blocked?

Because current_body before moving: [(8,4)]

new_head = (8,7): not in current_body.

So proceed:

Insert old_head (8,6) into body → [ (8,6), (8,4) ]

Since it's not eating apple yet, remove last element. Wait no—if move to (8,7):

current_body is [(8,4)], so after inserting head at front: [ (8,6), (8,4) ]

Then since moving Up into position where there's nothing blocking, but as per movement rules:

If not on apple, the snake removes tail. So in this case, remove last element of body.

Therefore new_body becomes [ (8,6) ].

Wait that seems odd because it reduces body length. That can't be right; each move should at least maintain or increase the number of segments if eating.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving into a cell without apple:

new_head is moved, old_head is inserted in front, and last segment is removed to keep same count.

So from (8,6):

insert head → [H1: (8,5), H2: (8,4) ]

then since not on apple, remove tail. So new_body becomes only [(8,5)], which was original position—this can't be right either.

This suggests that the algorithm is flawed in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps upon moving, all segments shift forward except adding or removing as per rules.

Wait maybe each movement step:

1. The snake's head moves to a new cell.
2. Each segment follows behind by one cell (shifting body).
3. If the new_head doesn't hit apple and isn't being eaten, remove tail to keep same length.
4. If on apple:
   - After inserting old_head into front,
   - Add a new segment at end in direction of movement.

Thus:

Move 1: from (8,5) move Up → (8,6)

Body becomes [ (8,5), ... ] shifted by one? No—probably better to model the body as a list where each element is a position. So starting with [(8,4)].

After inserting head at front:

new_body = [(8,5), (8,4)]

then if not on apple, remove last element → back to [(8,5)]

But that's going in circles; doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each movement step appends a new segment without removing anything. So when moving Up from (8,5) to (8,6):

new_head is (8,6)

old_body = [ (8,4) ]

Insert old_head → new_body = [ (8,6), (8,4) ]

Then since not on apple and didn't eat it, append no more.

So S becomes two segments: [(8,6), (8,4)]

But that seems to shift the body backward—maybe opposite of intended movement. Alternatively, maybe each move adds a segment at front without removing any.

This is too confusing.

In conclusion, perhaps given time constraints, moving Up twice and then Left once would bring the snake towards the apple in three moves:

1. (8,5) → Up to (8,6)
2. (8,6) → Up to (8,7)—but wait body has someone at (8,4), so this is safe.
3. Then Left from (8,7) to (7,7)

But when moving from (8,7) to (7,7):

Check if that's the apple position.

If on apple:

Insert old_head = (7,7) into body → new_body = [ (7,6), (8,7) ]

Then add a segment at end in direction of movement—Left. So from (7,7) moving to (7,6), but since we're already there.

Wait not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps when on apple location:

Insert head and then append new segment opposite direction.

This is getting too involved without proper rules.

I think the minimal number of moves required would be three: two Up and one Left. But given that after moving to (7,7) it's possible the snake has grown.

But since in my initial plan I reached apple in two moves if moving diagonally:

From (8,5) → move Up to (8,6), then Left to (7,6). Not apple yet.

Then third move: from (7,6) → Up to (7,7). Then snake would have grown or just moved into the position. Thus total three moves.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple in a minimum of three moves by moving Up twice and then Left once:

1. Move Up from (8,5) to (8,6).
2. Move Left from (8,6) to (7,6).
3. Move Up again from (7,6) to (7,7), which is the apple's location.

**Answer:** The snake reaches the apple in \boxed{3} moves.
