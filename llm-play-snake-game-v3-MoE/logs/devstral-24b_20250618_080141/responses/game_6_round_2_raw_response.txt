========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the current game state and determine a safe path for the snake to reach the apple.

## Current State:
- Head position: `(1,6)`
- Direction: `"DOWN"`
- Body cells: `[(1,7)]`
- Apple position: `(9,5)`

Let's break down the requirements and constraints:

1. **Movement Directions**: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
2. **No Reversal**: Can't go UP if coming from DOWN or LEFT if coming from RIGHT.
3. **Collision Avoidance**: Don't run into walls or body segments (except the tail).
4. **Path to Apple**: Need to reach `(9,5)` from `(1,6)`
   - Delta x = 8 (rightward)
   - Delta y = -1 (downward)

## Path Planning:
- I'll need to move primarily right (`RIGHT`) and a bit down (`DOWN`).
- The snake's current direction is DOWN, so the first move must be consistent with that.

Let's simulate safe moves:

### Starting Position: `(1,6)` â†’ Direction: `"DOWN"`
1. **Move RIGHT**: `(2,6)`
2. **Move RIGHT**: `(3,6)`
3. **Move RIGHT**: `(4,6)`
4. **Move RIGHT**: `(5,6)`
5. **Move RIGHT**: `(6,6)`
6. **Move RIGHT**: `(7,6)`
7. **Move RIGHT**: `(8,6)`

Now we need to adjust vertically:
8. **Move RIGHT**: `(9,6)`
9. **Move DOWN**: `(9,5)` (Apple position)

This path is valid as it doesn't reverse direction and avoids collisions with the body.

Let's verify:

- Right moves: 8 times
- Down moves: 1 time (last move)
- Starting at (1,6), ending at (9,5)

This matches the requirements.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move right 8 times to align with the apple's x-coordinate, then move down once to reach the apple at (9,5)."
}
