========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. So, we're playing the classic Snake game, and I need to plan a safe path for the snake's head to reach the apple without colliding with its body or going out of bounds. The snake can't reverse direction immediately, which adds some constraints.

First, let me understand the current state:

- **Head position**: (4, 0). So that's on the bottom row, middle-left area.
- **Current direction**: LEFT. That means the last move was to the left. But since it's given as the current direction, I need to make sure my next move doesn't reverse this. Wait, no—directions can't be reversed unless it's NONE. Since current is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT because that would be reversing? Or wait, the movement rules say you cannot reverse direction. So if moving LEFT, you can't go RIGHT next. Hmm.

Wait, let me check: rule 3 says the snake cannot reverse direction. For example, if going UP, cannot move DOWN next. So current direction is LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing. Wait no—LEFT and RIGHT are opposite? Or is it that you can't go in the exact opposite direction. Let me see: moving LEFT is (-1,0), so the opposite would be RIGHT (1,0). Yes, so from LEFT, can't go RIGHT next.

So current direction is LEFT; possible next moves are UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT.

Wait no—the movement rules allow any move except reversing. So if current direction is LEFT, next direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again? Or can it switch to RIGHT as long as it's not the exact opposite?

I think rule 3 says you cannot reverse, so from LEFT, you can go up, down, left, but not right.

Wait no—directions are "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", and "NONE". But in movement rules, direction vectors are given as these. So the current direction is LEFT; next move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing. Wait, actually, perhaps it's that you cannot change to the exact opposite direction. For example, if moving UP, you can't go DOWN next. Similarly, moving LEFT, you can't go RIGHT next.

So in this case, the current direction is LEFT; so the first move can be UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT. Wait, no—the initial direction is given as LEFT, and according to rule 3, you cannot reverse direction. So the next move can't be RIGHT because that's the opposite of LEFT. Therefore, from LEFT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

But wait, the snake is at (4,0), moving LEFT would take it to (3,0). But let's see if that's allowed. Also, we need to check body cells. The body cells are [(5,0)], which is behind the head—so that's one cell back from the head. So when moving, the snake's body follows.

But for movement planning, I should think about the path towards the apple at (7,1). Let's compute the required moves in terms of direction counts:

From (4,0) to (7,1):

- x increases by 3: so more RIGHTs than LEFTs. So right moves minus left moves = 3.
- y increases by 1: up moves minus down moves = 1.

So the total number of RIGHT moves should be 3 more than LEFTs, and UP moves one more than DOWNs.

Now, let me try to plan a path:

Current head is at (4,0), body is [(5,0)]—so that's the previous position. So if I move LEFT from (4,0) next, it would go to (3,0). But wait, moving LEFT when current direction is LEFT: can I do that? Because I'm not reversing direction; I'm continuing in the same direction.

Wait, no: current direction is LEFT, so moving LEFT again is allowed because it's not a reversal. So next move could be LEFT to (3,0). But then, after that, where can we go?

But let's see if that's useful. The apple is at (7,1), which is higher x and y. So perhaps moving rightwards would help.

Wait, but the current direction is LEFT; so first move cannot be RIGHT because it's reversing. Therefore, from LEFT, next moves can't be RIGHT.

So to get to (7,1) which is to the right, we have to make some rights, but without immediately reversing.

So perhaps first move is DOWN or UP? Let me check.

Current head is at (4,0), direction is LEFT. Next possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN.

If I go UP from (4,0), that would take me to (4,1). From there, maybe I can start moving rightwards. But wait, can the snake move up?

Wait, the grid's y increases upwards. So (4,0) is bottom row; moving up would take it to (4,1).

So let's explore moving UP first.

Move 1: UP → (4,1). Now, direction is UP. Then, next moves can't be DOWN because that would reverse the current direction of UP.

From (4,1), I need to move towards (7,1). So x needs to increase by 3. But how?

If I change direction to RIGHT from UP, that's allowed because it's not reversing. Let's see:

Move 2: RIGHT → (5,1).

Now, the snake is moving right. From here, can we continue right? Yes.

So move 3: RIGHT → (6,1)

Move 4: RIGHT → (7,1). So that would reach the apple.

But wait, let's think about the body movement. Each time the head moves, the body follows, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, but when the snake eats the apple, it grows by one segment, so the tail isn't removed next move.

So in this case, after moving to (7,1), the apple is at that position, so the snake will grow. So body cells would include all previous positions except the tail is not removed because we ate an apple.

But let's think about the steps:

Start: head at (4,0), body [(5,0)].

Move 1: UP → new head (4,1). Body becomes [(4,0), (5,0)], but wait no—when you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. So after moving, the old head becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, in this case, when we make a move that doesn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. But since in our first step, we're not eating the apple, so after each move, the snake's body shifts: the head moves, and the tail is removed.

But when you eat the apple, the body grows by one segment because the tail isn't removed.

So let's simulate:

Initial state:
- Head: (4,0)
- Body: [(5,0)]
- Direction: LEFT

After move 1: UP
- New head: (4,1)
- Previous head (4,0) becomes part of body.
- Tail is (5,0), so it's removed unless apple was eaten. Since no apple here, tail is removed.

So new body: [(4,0)]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the body list includes all segments except the head. So after moving, the old head becomes a body segment, and the previous tail (5,0) is removed unless we ate an apple. Since in this first move, we didn't eat an apple, the tail (5,0) would be gone.

So new state:

- Head: (4,1)
- Body: [ (4,0) ]

But wait, that's only one body segment? Because initial body was [(5,0)], and after moving up, the old head is added to body, making it [ (4,0), (5,0) ]? Or is it [ (5,0) ] because tail is removed?

I think each move:

- The new head is computed as current head + direction.
- The previous head becomes part of the body.
- If apple was eaten in this move, then the tail isn't removed; else, it is.

So for the first move (UP), since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (5,0) is removed. So the new body would be [ (4,0) ] because only the previous head is added, and the old tail is cut off.

Wait no—when you make a move, all segments except the head shift forward. The tail is dropped unless you ate an apple.

So in initial state: body is [(5,0)]. Head is at (4,0). When moving up to (4,1), the new body would be:

- Previous head (4,0) becomes next segment after new head (4,1).

So body becomes [ (4,0) ].

Because we didn't eat an apple in this move, so tail is removed. So initial body was [(5,0)], which was behind the head. After moving up to (4,1), the old head (4,0) is now part of the body, and the tail (5,0) is removed because no apple.

So after first move:

Head: (4,1)

Body: [ (4,0) ]

Move 2: RIGHT → (5,1). Now, direction is RIGHT. Since previous direction was UP, moving to RIGHT is allowed as it's not reversing.

After this move, new head is (5,1). The old head (4,1) becomes part of the body. Body now includes [ (4,0), (4,1) ]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (4,0) is removed? Or wait: no.

Wait, when you move, the tail is dropped only if you don't eat an apple. So in this case, moving to (5,1):

- New head: (5,1)
- Previous head becomes part of body.
- Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (4,0) is removed.

Wait no—body was [ (4,0) ] before move 2. After moving, new head is (5,1), and the previous head (4,1) is added to the body. So body becomes [ (4,1) ], because we remove the old tail (4,0).

So after move 2:

Head: (5,1)

Body: [ (4,1) ]

Wait, but that seems off. Because when moving from (4,1) to (5,1), the body was only [ (4,0) ] before this move? Or no—I think I might be getting confused.

Let me try to track each step carefully:

Initial state:

- Head: (4,0)
- Body: [(5,0)]
- Direction: LEFT

Move 1: UP
- New head: (4,1)
- Previous body: [(5,0)]
- Since no apple eaten, tail is removed. So new body is [ (4,0) ] because the old head (4,0) is added to the body and the tail (5,0) is removed.

So after move 1:

Head: (4,1)

Body: [ (4,0) ]

Move 2: RIGHT
- New head: (5,1)
- Previous direction was UP; moving RIGHT is allowed.
- Body before this move: [ (4,0) ]
- After moving, previous head (4,1) becomes part of body. So new body is [ (4,0), (4,1) ]
- Since no apple eaten, tail (4,0) is removed. So new body is [ (4,1) ]

So after move 2:

Head: (5,1)

Body: [ (4,1) ]

Move 3: RIGHT
- New head: (6,1)
- Previous direction was RIGHT; can continue.
- Body before this move: [ (4,1) ]
- After moving, previous head (5,1) is added to body. So new body is [ (4,1), (5,1) ]
- Tail (4,1) remains if apple eaten; else removed.

Since we didn't eat the apple yet, tail (4,1) is removed. So new body: [ (5,1) ]

Wait, no—after moving to (6,1):

- New head: (6,1)
- Previous body segments are [ (4,1), (5,1) ] added? Or am I getting this wrong.

I think the process is:

Each move adds the previous head to the body, then removes the tail unless an apple was eaten.

So after each move, the steps are:

1. Compute new head.
2. Add old head to body list.
3. If not eating an apple, remove last element of body (tail).

But wait, when you eat an apple, the body grows, so in that case, step 3 is skipped.

Let me try again with this logic:

Initial state after move 1:

- Head: (4,1)
- Body: [ (4,0) ] because we added previous head (4,0) from initial position, and since no apple was eaten, tail (5,0) was removed.

Move 2: RIGHT to (5,1)

- New head: (5,1)
- Old head: (4,1) → add to body.
- So body becomes [ (4,0), (4,1) ]
- Since no apple eaten, remove tail: remove (4,0). So body is now [ (4,1) ]

Move 3: RIGHT to (6,1)

- New head: (6,1)
- Old head: (5,1) → add to body.
- Body becomes [ (4,1), (5,1) ]
- No apple eaten yet, so remove tail (4,1). So body is now [ (5,1) ]

Move 4: RIGHT to (7,1)

Now, new head is (7,1), which is the apple's position. So we eat the apple.

So:

- New head: (7,1)
- Old head: (6,1) → add to body.
- Body before this move was [ (5,1) ]
- After adding, body becomes [ (5,1), (6,1) ]
- Since we ate an apple, we don't remove the tail. So body remains [ (5,1), (6,1) ]

So now:

- Head: (7,1)
- Body: [ (5,1), (6,1) ]

This is good because after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by one.

Now, check for collision with itself. The new head (7,1) is not in body [ (5,1), (6,1) ], so no collision.

But wait—after eating the apple at (7,1), are there any other steps?

I think that's it. So the sequence of moves would be:

UP → RIGHT → RIGHT → RIGHT

Each move after UP would involve changing direction from UP to RIGHT in move 2, which is allowed because you're not reversing.

Wait, but the directions change: from UP to RIGHT—is that allowed? Because each direction can be changed as long as it's not the opposite direction. So moving from UP to RIGHT is okay.

So let me check:

Move 1: Direction is LEFT (since initial state). After move 1 (UP), new direction is UP.

Move 2: From UP, change direction to RIGHT—allowed.

Then, move 3 and 4 continue in the same direction (RIGHT).

This seems fine.

But wait, after the first move (UP) to (4,1), what's the state:

- Head: (4,1)
- Body: [ (4,0) ]

So it's a snake of length 2 (head and one body segment). So in this case, when moving further, as long as the new head doesn't collide with its own body, it's fine.

But let me see if there are any other possible paths or if this is the only way.

Another approach: After initial state, can we move right instead of up? Let's see:

Initial state:

- Head: (4,0)
- Body: [ (5,0) ]
- Direction: LEFT

If I try to change direction to RIGHT in the first move. Wait, current direction is LEFT; moving RIGHT would be opposite direction, which causes collision with body.

Because from (4,0), if you turn around and go to (5,0), that's where the body is—so that's a collision.

Hence, first move can't be RIGHT; must choose UP or DOWN.

Let me check DOWN:

Move 1: DOWN → (4,-1). But (4,-1) might be out of bounds? Assuming grid is from y=0 upwards. So (4,-1) would be invalid—so likely can't go down.

Hence, first move must be UP to (4,1).

So the only possible initial move is UP.

Then proceed as before: UP → RIGHT → RIGHT → RIGHT.

But that's four moves? Wait, no—each move corresponds to a step. So from initial position to (4,1) is one move; then three more steps to reach (7,1). So total of four moves.

Wait, but let me count:

Move 1: UP

Move 2: RIGHT

Move 3: RIGHT

Move 4: RIGHT → reaches apple.

Yes, four moves.

But in this case, after eating the apple, the snake is longer. But I think that's acceptable.

Another possible path: After moving up to (4,1), can we move right three times? Yes.

Alternatively, could we make a different path?

For example:

Move 1: UP → (4,1)

Move 2: RIGHT → (5,1)

Move 3: DOWN → (5,0). Wait, but that's where the body is?

Wait, after move 1, body is [ (4,0) ].

After move 2:

- Head: (5,1)
- Body: [ (4,1), (4,0) ]? Or wait no—each time you add the previous head and remove tail unless apple eaten.

Wait, this seems confusing. Maybe it's better to stick with the initial plan of UP → RIGHT ×3.

So yes, that would be a valid path without collision.

But let me check if there are other possibilities. For example:

After move 1: UP to (4,1). Then turn LEFT? But from direction UP, turning LEFT is allowed as long as it's not opposite.

Wait, in terms of grid movement, from UP, possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT and DOWN?

No—when you're moving UP, your next direction can't be DOWN because that would reverse the direction. So after moving UP, you can go LEFT or RIGHT.

So from (4,1), if I choose to move LEFT instead of RIGHT:

Move 2: LEFT → (3,1)

Then, move 3: LEFT again → (2,1). But then how do we reach (7,1)? That's in the opposite direction. So that would not be efficient.

Alternatively, from (4,1), after moving LEFT to (3,1):

Move 3: DOWN → (3,0)

But (3,0) is adjacent to where? Not sure if this helps.

It seems more efficient to move right three times after UP, so the path would require four moves total.

Wait, but let me think about whether that's the minimal number of steps.

Alternative approach:

From initial position, could I make a U-turn and go right? No, because from direction LEFT, turning around is not allowed as it would hit the body.

Hence, first move must be UP.

Then, three rights.

Yes, four moves total.

But let me visualize this on grid:

Initial: (4,0) with body at (5,0).

Move 1: UP to (4,1). Body now is [ (4,0) ] since we removed tail after move 1.

Wait no—the body was [ (5,0) ] before move 1. After moving up:

- New head: (4,1)
- Old head (4,0) added to body.
- Since no apple eaten, remove tail (5,0). So body is [ (4,0) ]

So after first move, the snake is now at (4,1), with a single body segment at (4,0).

Move 2: RIGHT → (5,1)

After this move:

- New head: (5,1)
- Old head (4,1) added to body.
- Body becomes [ (4,0), (4,1) ]
- Since no apple eaten, remove tail (4,0). So body is [ (4,1) ]

So after move 2:

Head: (5,1)

Body: [ (4,1) ]

Move 3: RIGHT → (6,1)

After this move:

- New head: (6,1)
- Old head (5,1) added to body.
- Body becomes [ (4,1), (5,1) ]
- Since no apple eaten, remove tail (4,1). So body is [ (5,1) ]

Move 4: RIGHT → (7,1)

Eats the apple.

After this move:

- New head: (7,1)
- Old head (6,1) added to body.
- Body before was [ (5,1) ]
- Now body becomes [ (5,1), (6,1) ] because we ate an apple, so tail isn't removed.

So final state after move 4:

Head: (7,1)

Body: [ (5,1), (6,1) ]

Which is correct and no collision.

Therefore, the path is UP → RIGHT ×3.

But wait, that's four moves. The initial position counts as step 0? Or are we counting each move as a step?

In any case, yes, this would be the minimal number of steps needed to reach (7,1) without colliding with self and eating the apple.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate a snake from its starting position to an apple located at a specific target position on a grid. The snake can move up, down, left, or right, but cannot reverse direction immediately as it would collide with its own body.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: The snake starts at position (4, 0) with its body segment at (5, 0). The initial direction is set to LEFT.
2. **First Move**: From the starting position, the snake must move UP to avoid collision with its body. This brings the head to (4, 1).
3. **Subsequent Moves**: After moving UP, the snake changes direction to RIGHT and continues moving in this direction three times to reach the target position (7, 1). Each move updates the head position, adds the previous head to the body segments, and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

### Solution Code
```python
def solve():
    # Initial state
    head = (4, 0)
    body = [(5, 0)]
    direction = 'LEFT'
    
    # Move 1: UP
    new_head = (head[0], head[1] + 1)  # (4,1)
    direction = 'UP'
    body = [head] + body[:-1] if len(body) > 0 else []
    
    # Check collision after move 1
    if new_head in body:
        return "Collision"
    
    head, body = new_head, body
    
    # Move 2: RIGHT
    new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])  # (5,1)
    direction = 'RIGHT'
    body = [head] + body[:-1]
    
    if new_head in body:
        return "Collision"
    
    head, body = new_head, body
    
    # Move 3: RIGHT
    new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])  # (6,1)
    direction = 'RIGHT'
    body = [head] + body[:-1]
    
    if new_head in body:
        return "Collision"
    
    head, body = new_head, body
    
    # Move 4: RIGHT
    new_head = (head[0] + 1, head[1])  # (7,1)
    direction = 'RIGHT'
    body = [head] + body  # Apple eaten, do not remove tail
    
    if new_head in body:
        return "Collision"
    
    head, body = new_head, body
    
    return "Success"

solve()
```

### Explanation
The solution involves a series of moves where the snake first moves UP to avoid collision and then continues moving RIGHT three times to reach the target. Each move updates the snake's position and checks for self-collision. The final state ensures the snake has successfully eaten the apple without colliding with itself.
