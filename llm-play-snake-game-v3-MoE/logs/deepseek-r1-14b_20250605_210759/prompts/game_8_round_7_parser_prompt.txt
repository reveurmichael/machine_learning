BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (5,4) to eat the apple at (7,0). The current direction is "RIGHT," and the body cells are [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7)]. So the snake's head is at (5,4), moving right, which means it's currently extending its body to the east.

First, I need to visualize the grid. The head is at (5,4). To reach (7,0), the apple is two cells to the right and four cells down from the head. So in terms of direction, that would require moving right twice and down four times.

But wait, the snake's body is currently extending upwards. Let me list out the body parts: starting behind the head at (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), and finally the tail at (3,7). So from (5,4), moving right would have taken it to (5,4) as the new head, but since the body is already there, that's not possible because moving right would take it into its own body.

Wait no, actually, the current head is at (5,4), and the direction is "RIGHT," which means the next move after this would be to the east. But looking at the body cells, the immediate next segment is (4,4). So if the snake moves right from (5,4) in the first step, it's allowed because the new head will be at (6,4), and none of the body parts are there yet.

Wait no, wait a minute. Let me think again. The current state: head is at (5,4). Body cells are [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7)]. So after moving right once, the new head would be at (6,4). Then, we need to check for collisions. The body is behind: (4,4) is two cells west of the new head, so no collision there.

After moving right, the body will shift. Since this move didn't eat an apple, the tail will move, so the body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)]. Wait, actually, according to the update rules: insert old head at front of body list, then if not eating, remove last element.

Wait, initial S is [HEAD (5,4), BODY1 (4,4), BODY2 (4,5), etc.] So when moving right:

1. new_head = (6,4)
2. Check collision: no, since (6,4) isn't in the body.
3. Insert old head (5,4) at front of body → [(5,4), (4,4), ...]
4. Since not eating apple, remove tail → the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]. So the snake's new state would be head at (6,4), and body parts as listed.

Okay, that seems safe. Now, the next move: from (6,4). Current direction is now "RIGHT." But wait, according to movement rules, you can't reverse direction immediately. The previous direction was "RIGHT," so I think the first move after that would be another right or something else? Wait no, the current direction is given as "RIGHT" in the input, but the next move must not be the opposite. So after moving right once, if I want to change direction, I can't go left.

Wait, the movement rules say you cannot reverse. So from a direction D, the next direction can't be the opposite. For example, if current is RIGHT, next can't be LEFT; if current is UP, next can't be DOWN. But since in this case, the initial move was right, and the next moves need to comply with that.

Wait no, wait: The current direction is "RIGHT." So for the first move, when we are moving right, but after that, the new direction will still be the one chosen by us. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me clarify: When the snake is in a certain direction, the next move can't be the opposite. So if it's currently moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT, and vice versa. But for other directions like UP or DOWN, similar restrictions apply.

In this case, since the initial direction is RIGHT, the first move must not be LEFT. After that, each subsequent move must follow the same rule: you can't reverse the previous direction.

So after moving right once to (6,4), the next move cannot be left. So from (6,4), possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

But our target is at (7,0). From (5,4) to (7,0), we need two rights and four downs. Let me see: maybe plan a path that goes right twice and then down four times.

But I have to be careful about the body parts moving each step and making sure that the new head doesn't collide with any of them.

Let's outline possible moves:

1. Move RIGHT to (6,4). Body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]. No collision.
2. Next move: can't be LEFT. Options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

If I move down from (6,4) to (6,3). Let's see if that's safe.

After moving down, new head is at (6,3). Check body positions: the body parts after the first step were [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]. So (6,3) isn't in these positions. Safe to move.

Then, update body: insert old head (6,4) at front → [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)], but since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail which is (4,6). So new body is [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)].

Wait no: after moving down from (6,4) to (6,3), the old head was at (6,4). Insert that into the body list. Then, since not eating apple, remove tail.

Original body after first move: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]. Wait no, wait: After the first move right to (6,4), the body is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)].

Then moving down from (6,4) to (6,3). Now, insert (6,4) into front of body → new body list becomes [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) ]. But since we didn't eat apple, remove tail. So the new body is [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) ].

So after this second move, the snake's head is at (6,3), and body parts are [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. So far, no collision issues.

Now, third move: from (6,3). Current direction was DOWN. Next move cannot be UP. Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. Let's see what we need to do next.

Our target is at (7,0), which is further down and to the right. So maybe moving down again towards that.

But wait, from (6,3), moving down would take us to (6,2). Is that safe? The body parts are [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. None of these are at (6,2), so it's safe.

After moving down to (6,2):

- Insert old head (6,3) into body → [ (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) ]
- Remove tail: since not eating apple, the new body becomes [ (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]

So now head is at (6,2). Next move can't be UP.

Hmm, but moving down further may not be optimal because we need to get two more rights and more downs. Alternatively, perhaps a different path would work better.

Alternatively, maybe after the first right, I should start moving down as much as possible.

Wait, let's try another approach. From (5,4), move right twice to reach (7,4). Then, from there, move down four times to (7,0).

But need to check if that path is clear of body parts and walls.

First, initial state: head at (5,4), direction RIGHT.

Move 1: Right to (6,4). Body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] → after insertion and removal, as discussed before.

Move 2: Right again to (7,4). Check collision: body parts are at [(6,4), (5,4), ...]. So moving right from (6,4) would go to (7,4). The body is currently [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]. So (7,4) isn't in the body. Safe.

After moving to (7,4):

- Insert old head (6,4) into front → [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) ]
- Remove tail: new body is [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) ]

Now head at (7,4). Next move can't be LEFT because the previous direction was RIGHT.

So from (7,4), possible directions are DOWN, UP, or RIGHT again. But since our target is down, let's go down.

Move 3: Down to (7,3). Check body parts: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]. So safe.

Insert old head (7,4) into front → [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) ]
Remove tail: new body is [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Move 4: Down to (7,2). Again, check body parts: none are at (7,2). Safe.

Insert old head (7,3) → [ (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]
Remove tail: new body is [ (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]

Move 5: Down to (7,1). Safe.

Insert old head → [ (7,2), (7,3), ... ]
Body after removal: [ (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4) ]

Move 6: Down to (7,0). Now check if any body parts are at (7,0). The body is [(7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)]. So moving down from (7,1) to (7,0): safe.

But wait, after the fifth move, the head is at (7,1), and then we can't reverse direction because the previous move was DOWN. Wait no: each time, the next move can't be the opposite of the current direction.

Wait, from (7,3) moving down to (7,2): direction is DOWN. Next move can't be UP.

From (7,2), move down again: same direction. Then from (7,1), same thing. So it's allowed as long as we don't switch to UP.

But then, after moving down four times, we reach the apple at (7,0).

Wait, but let me count the steps:

After two rights to (7,4): that's move 2.

Then four downs: moves 3-6. So total of six moves. But each time, after a move, the body shifts.

But need to make sure that during these moves, none of the new head positions collide with any body parts.

Alternatively, perhaps moving down first and then right would be better, but I'm not sure.

Wait another idea: from (5,4), maybe it's better to go down a bit first before going right. Let me see.

But the initial direction is RIGHT, so can't move left immediately. So the first move has to be in RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

If I move up first, that would take head to (5,5). But let's see:

Move 1: Up from (5,4) to (5,5). Check body parts: [(4,4), ...]. No collision. Then the body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] after inserting old head and removing tail.

But moving up doesn't get us closer to the target, which is down and right. So perhaps not optimal.

Alternatively, move down first:

Move 1: Down from (5,4) to (5,3). Safe? Body parts are [(4,4), ...], so yes. Then insert old head (5,4) into body → [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)].

Remove tail: new body is [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)].

Then next move can't be UP. So from (5,3), options are RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN.

Moving right to (6,3). Let's check if that's safe. The body parts are [(5,4), ...], so no collision.

After moving right:

Insert old head (5,3) → [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]
Remove tail: new body is [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) ]

Now at (6,3). Next move can't be LEFT. So possible directions are RIGHT, UP, DOWN.

If I continue moving right to (7,3), then from there down four times.

But this seems similar to the earlier path but starting with a down first. Not sure if it's better.

I think that the key is to plan a path that moves right twice and down four times without stepping into any body parts as they shift each time.

Let me try mapping out each move step by step, considering how the body changes:

Initial state:
Head: (5,4)
Body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,7)]
Direction: RIGHT

Move 1: Right to (6,4). Check collision? Body is behind at (5,4) and beyond; no. So safe.
Update body:
Insert old head → [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,7)]
Remove tail → new body: [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) ]

Move 2: Right again to (7,4). Check collision? Body is now [(6,4), ...], so no. Safe.
Update body:
Insert old head → [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]
Remove tail → new body: [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) ]

Move 3: Down to (7,3). Check collision? Body parts are [(6,4), ...], no. Safe.
Update body:
Insert old head → [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]
Remove tail → new body: [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]

Move 4: Down to (7,2). Safe.
Update body:
Insert old head → [ (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]
Remove tail → new body: [ (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ]

Move 5: Down to (7,1). Safe.
Update body:
Insert old head → [ (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4)]
Remove tail → new body: [ (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4) ]

Move 6: Down to (7,0). Safe.
Update body:
Insert old head → [ (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4)]
Remove tail → new body: [ (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4) ]

So after six moves, the snake has successfully reached the apple at (7,0). Each move was checked for collision with the body parts, and none occurred. Also, the direction changes didn't violate the reversal rule since we only moved in the same or other allowed directions.

Therefore, the path would be: Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down.
</think>

The snake can reach the apple by moving right twice and then down four times without colliding with its body. The sequence of moves is:

Right → Right → Down → Down → Down → Down

So, the final answer is:

$\boxed{\text{Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down}}$
```

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (7, 0). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
