========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left (from x=6 to 5) and down (from y=5 to 4) to reach the apple. First, moving DOWN to (6,4) avoids collision with the body (current body segments are at (5,5) and higher y-values). Then, moving LEFT to (5,4) reaches the apple, which is safe as (5,4) is not occupied by the body. This path adheres to movement rules and ensures no self-collision."
