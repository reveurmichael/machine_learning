{"moves": ["UP", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake should move UP to reach (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8). Since there's an obstacle at (5,7), it will move DOWN to (4,8) again. Then, since the apple is at (4,2) and we cannot move directly there from our current position, we move LEFT twice to (3,8), then DOWN to reach (3,7). From here, we can finally reach the apple by moving DOWN once more."}
