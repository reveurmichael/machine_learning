========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 4 times (to reach x=9) and down 6 times (to reach y=0). Starting with RIGHT moves avoids reversing the initial direction and navigates the head toward the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent DOWN moves align with the apple's y-coordinate. These moves avoid collisions with the snake's body, which is initially positioned left and above the head, and after each move, the body updates safely. After reaching the apple, the snake can legally move left (among other directions) next turn, preventing immediate trapping."
