{"moves": ["down", "left", "left"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at (9, 8) moving right initially. The first move can be either up or down because moving left would reverse its direction, which is not allowed immediately after starting to the right. In this scenario, we choose to move 'down' as it allows us to stay within the bounds of the grid and avoid reversing direction. After each subsequent move, we ensure that the snake does not collide with itself by checking for self-collision before generating the next possible moves."}
