<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple at (0,0) from its current head position at (6,6). The snake's body is empty right now, so it's just the head. The direction is set to "DOWN", but since the body is empty, I think that might not affect the initial moves much.

First, I need to understand the movement rules and constraints. The snake can't reverse its direction immediately. Since the current direction is "DOWN", on the first move, it can't go "UP". But wait, the current direction is "DOWN", but if the body is empty, maybe that's just the initial state, and the first move can be any direction except the opposite of the current one? Or does "NONE" apply here since there are no body segments to worry about?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: If the current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed. But in this case, the current direction is "DOWN". So I think the first move can't be "UP" because that's reversing. Wait no, wait: The movement rules say you cannot reverse. So if current direction is "DOWN", next move can't be "UP", and vice versa. Similarly for left-right.

Wait, but in this case, since the body is empty, maybe the initial direction doesn't matter much because there are no body segments to collide with except perhaps the tail, which isn't present here.

So starting at (6,6), the apple is at (0,0). The Manhattan distance is 12 (6 steps left and 6 down). But I need to think about how the snake will move without colliding with its body or walls.

Since the body is empty, the initial moves are free. So perhaps moving directly towards the apple would be best. Let's see: from (6,6), going LEFT six times to get to x=0, then DOWN six times to y=0? But wait, (0,0) is at the bottom-left corner, so from (6,6), which is top-right, I need to go left 6 steps and down 6 steps. Wait no: The coordinates are such that (0,0) is bottom-left, and (9,9) is top-right. So moving DOWN decreases y, but wait, the problem says "DOWN" means y-1, so from (6,6), which is in the middle, going down would decrease y.

Wait no: Wait, the coordinate system has (0,0) as bottom-left, and (9,9) as top-right. So moving UP increases y by 1, DOWN decreases y by 1. So to get from (6,6) to (0,0), I need to move LEFT six times (x-1 each time) and DOWN six times (y-1 each time). But wait, no: Wait, starting at (6,6), which is x=6, y=6. The apple is at (0,0). So the snake needs to decrease x by 6 and y by 6.

Wait, but the movement can be in any order as long as it's a safe path. Since there are no body segments, perhaps moving directly towards the apple is possible.

But wait, let me think about the direction constraints. The initial direction is "DOWN". So on the first move, I cannot choose "UP" if I'm reversing. Wait, but since the current direction is "DOWN", can't choose "UP" as the next move. But in this case, since the body is empty, maybe it's okay to change direction.

Wait no: The movement rules say that you cannot reverse. So if current direction is "DOWN", next move can't be "UP". Similarly for other directions. But if current direction is "NONE" (which it isn't here), any first move is allowed.

In this case, since the body is empty, I think the initial moves can be in any direction as long as they don't reverse from the previous direction, but wait: Wait, no—wait, the movement rules say that you cannot choose a direction that's the opposite of the current one. So if current direction is "DOWN", next move can't be "UP".

Wait, but since the body is empty, perhaps after moving in one direction, I can change directions as needed.

But wait, let me think: The initial head is at (6,6), and the apple is at (0,0). To get there, the snake needs to move left 6 times and down 6 times. But since the body grows when it eats the apple, perhaps we can plan a path that goes in one direction as much as possible.

Wait, but let's think about the movement process. Each time the snake moves, if it doesn't eat an apple, its tail is removed, so the length remains the same. If it does eat the apple, the body grows by one segment without removing the tail.

But in this case, since the body starts empty, when the head reaches the apple, the body will grow to include all the previous positions. But wait, no: Wait, when the snake eats the apple, the body grows by not removing the tail. So if the snake is moving towards the apple and then eats it, its length increases by one.

But in this case, starting with an empty body, the path can be straightforward.

Wait, but let me think about possible collisions. Since there are no body segments initially, the only collision risk is hitting the walls or stepping on a cell that will be occupied by the tail after movement.

Wait, when the snake moves and eats the apple, the tail doesn't move, so if the new head is adjacent to the old tail (which is now part of the body), there might be a collision. Wait no: When the snake eats the apple, it grows without removing the tail, but in this case, since the body was empty before, after eating, the body will have one segment (the old head) and then the new head.

Wait, let's see an example:

If the snake is at (6,6), moves to (5,6) [LEFT], then that's the new head. Since there are no body segments, it's just the head. Then next move could be LEFT again to (4,6). And so on until x=0, but wait, (0,0) is at the bottom-left corner, so perhaps moving down after reaching x=0.

Wait, maybe a better path would be to first go down as much as possible, then left. Or vice versa. Let's see:

From (6,6), if I move LEFT six times: that would take me from x=6 to x=0, but y remains 6 each time. Then, after reaching (0,6), I can start moving DOWN six times to reach (0,0). But wait, the initial direction is "DOWN", so on the first move, if I choose LEFT, that's allowed because it's not reversing from "DOWN" (since "LEFT" and "RIGHT" are each other's reverses? Wait no: The movement rules say that you cannot reverse. So for example, if current direction is "UP", next can't be "DOWN". Similarly, "LEFT" and "RIGHT" can't be reversed.

Wait, but in this case, the initial direction is "DOWN", so the first move can't be "UP". But I can choose any other direction except "UP".

So from (6,6), current direction is "DOWN". So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Wait no: The movement rules say that you cannot reverse. So if current direction is "DOWN", next move can't be "UP". Similarly for others.

Wait, but wait: The movement rules state:

2. **Cannot reverse**: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". If current direction is "NONE", any first move is allowed.

So if the current direction is "DOWN", then the next move can't be "UP".

Wait, but in this case, since the initial state's direction is "DOWN", and the body is empty, what are the possible moves? Let me see:

Possible directions for the first move: any except "UP" (since that would reverse). So options are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or "DOWN".

But wait, if I'm at (6,6) and choose to go DOWN, that would take me to (6,5), which is within bounds. Then next moves can be planned accordingly.

Alternatively, choosing LEFT first might be better for reaching the apple more directly.

Wait, but perhaps a more efficient path would involve moving in one direction as much as possible without causing any collisions or getting stuck.

Another consideration: After eating the apple, the snake must have at least one legal move next turn. So I need to ensure that after growing, the snake's body doesn't block all possible paths.

But since the initial body is empty, perhaps it's safe to plan a straightforward path.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. From (6,6), move LEFT six times: each step reduces x by 1 until x=0 at y=6. Then from (0,6), move DOWN six times to reach (0,0). But wait, that's not correct because moving from (0,6) down would require moving in the DOWN direction (y-1), but I need to reach y=0.

Wait no: Starting at (6,6):

Move LEFT once: (5,6)
LEFT again: (4,6)
... until x=0: that's six moves, ending at (0,6).

Then, from (0,6), move DOWN six times:

DOWN to (0,5), then 4,3,2,1,0. That would take six more steps.

So total of 12 moves: six LEFTs and six DOWNs.

But I need to check if this is possible without any collisions and respecting the movement rules.

Wait, but after each move, the body grows unless it's eating an apple. Wait no: Only when the snake eats the apple does the body grow by not removing the tail. Otherwise, after each move (unless it's the first step), the tail is removed if there are body segments.

But in this case, since the initial body is empty, until the snake reaches the apple, the body remains empty except for the head and any new positions as it moves.

Wait no: Let me think about how the movement works:

When the snake moves, each step adds a new head position. If there's no apple, the tail (the oldest part of the body) is removed to keep the length the same. But if the snake eats the apple, the length increases by one segment without removing the tail.

But in this case, since the initial body is empty, moving towards the apple would not have any segments except the head, so there's no collision with the body until after eating the apple.

Wait, but when the snake reaches the apple (0,0), it will grow. But before that, all moves are just the head moving without any body to collide with.

So perhaps this path is possible:

1. Move LEFT six times: from x=6 to 0 at y=6.
2. Then move DOWN six times to reach y=0.

But wait, after each move, the tail (if any) is removed. But since there are no body segments initially, moving in any direction is safe except for walls.

Wait, but when you start moving, your first step would be from (6,6). If you choose LEFT as the first move, that's allowed because current direction is "DOWN", and LEFT isn't reversing.

Wait, wait: Current direction is "DOWN". So possible moves are any except "UP".

So if I'm at (6,6) and decide to go LEFT, which is not a reversal, so it's allowed. Then the next move can be anything except the reverse of the previous direction, which was LEFT.

Wait no: The movement rules say you cannot choose a direction that reverses from the current one. So after moving LEFT once (from DOWN), what are the possible next directions?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me recheck:

The rule says you can't choose a direction that is the opposite of your current direction. For example, if you're currently moving "DOWN", next move can't be "UP". Similarly, if you're moving "LEFT", next can't be "RIGHT".

Wait no: Wait, according to movement rules, it's about not reversing from the previous direction. So each time you change direction, you can't choose the exact opposite of your current direction.

So for example:

- If current direction is "DOWN", next move can't be "UP".
- If current direction is "LEFT", next can't be "RIGHT".

But in this case, since we're starting with "DOWN" as the initial direction (even though there's no body), perhaps the first move can be any except "UP".

Wait, but wait: The initial state has a current direction of "DOWN". So for the first move, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is not allowed). Wait, no: If you're currently in "DOWN", next can't be "UP". Other directions are allowed.

So from (6,6), choosing to go LEFT as the first move is allowed. Then, after that, the new current direction would be "LEFT", so next move can't be "RIGHT".

But perhaps a more efficient path would involve moving in one direction until reaching the target axis and then turning.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to just plan a straight path.

Another consideration: The initial moves are free from body collisions since there are no segments. So I can go any way as long as I don't reverse into my previous step.

So let me try planning:

1. Move LEFT six times, then DOWN six times.

But each move has to be in the allowed direction without reversing.

Wait, but after moving LEFT once (from "DOWN"), the current direction becomes "LEFT", so next moves can't be "RIGHT".

So from (6,6):

Move 1: LEFT → (5,6), current dir = LEFT
Move 2: LEFT → (4,6)
...
Move 6: LEFT → (0,6)

Now at (0,6). Current direction is LEFT. Next move can't be RIGHT.

So I need to change direction to DOWN.

But wait, can I do that? From current direction "LEFT", next move can't be "RIGHT". So moving DOWN is allowed because it's not the reverse of "LEFT".

Wait no: The movement rules say you cannot choose a direction that is the exact opposite of your current direction. So if current is LEFT, next can't be RIGHT.

But other directions (UP and DOWN) are allowed? Or wait, does the rule only apply to the same axis?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The movement rules state:

- You cannot choose a direction that's the opposite of your current one. So if you were moving LEFT, next can't be RIGHT; if you were moving UP, next can't be DOWN.

But directions on different axes (like LEFT and DOWN) are not opposites. So after moving LEFT, I can move DOWN without any issue.

So from (0,6), I can now start moving DOWN towards y=0.

Each move down reduces y by 1:

Move 7: DOWN → (0,5)
Move 8: DOWN → (0,4)
...
Move 12: DOWN → (0,0)

That's a total of 12 moves.

Wait, but wait: After each move, the current direction changes to the new direction. So after moving LEFT six times (moves 1-6), current direction is LEFT. Then move 7 is DOWN, so current direction becomes DOWN. Next moves can't be UP.

So from (0,6) to (0,0), I need to make six DOWN moves, each time changing the current direction to DOWN, and ensuring that none of them are reversing from the previous step.

Wait no: Each move's allowed directions depend on its own current direction. So after move 7 is DOWN, then move 8 can't be UP (since current dir is DOWN). But we're moving further down, so it's fine.

But wait, I'm trying to reach (0,0) from (0,6), which requires six moves DOWN: y goes from 6→5→4→3→2→1→0. That's six moves.

So total steps:

Moves 1-6: LEFT → x=0, current dir=LEFT
Move 7: DOWN → y=5, current dir=DOWN
Move 8: DOWN → y=4
Move 9: DOWN → y=3
Move 10: DOWN → y=2
Move 11: DOWN → y=1
Move 12: DOWN → y=0

So on the 12th move, the head reaches (0,0), which is where the apple is. So upon moving into that cell, the snake eats the apple and grows by one segment.

But wait, since the initial body was empty, after eating the apple, the body would consist of all the positions from (6,6) down to (5,6), ..., (0,6), then down to (0,5)...(0,0). Wait no: The body grows by adding a new head without removing the tail. So each move adds a new segment at the head and removes one from the tail unless it's an apple.

Wait, but in this case, since we're moving step by step, each step (except the last) would add a new head and remove the old tail, keeping the body length same until the last step where the apple is eaten, so the body grows.

But wait, with no initial body, the first move leaves only the new head at (5,6), then next moves continue. So after six LEFT moves, the snake's head is at (0,6), and the body would consist of all positions from (6,6) to (1,6) and (0,6)? Wait no: No, wait—the body only includes the path taken by the head minus the initial position. Or does it include all segments?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this part. Since the initial body is empty, each move just moves the head forward without any body to collide with until after eating the apple.

So when the snake reaches (0,0), it's the 12th move, and since that's where the apple is, the body grows by one segment, making the length two segments: the previous position (which would be (0,1)) and the new head at (0,0). Wait no: Let me think about how the body works.

Each time the snake moves:

- If it doesn't eat an apple, the tail is removed, so the body remains the same length.
- If it does eat an apple, the tail isn't removed; instead, a new segment is added at the head, increasing the length by one.

But in this case, since we're starting with no body (just the head), each move adds a new head and removes the previous tail. But wait, no: Wait, when you have an empty body, moving the head just changes its position without any segments behind it until you start adding them.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this. Let's clarify:

- The snake is represented by a sequence of coordinates representing its body, with the head at the front and the tail at the end.
- When the snake moves in a direction, the new head is added to the beginning of this list, and if it hasn't eaten an apple (i.e., the new head isn't on the apple's position), the last element (tail) is removed. This keeps the length constant unless it eats an apple, in which case the tail isn't removed, so the length increases by one.

But in our initial state, the snake's body is just [(6,6)], since there are no segments behind the head.

So:

Move 1: LEFT → new head at (5,6). Since this isn't the apple position (assuming the apple was placed at (0,0)), we add it to the front and remove the tail (which was (6,6)). Now body is [(5,6)].
Wait, but that would mean the snake's length remains 1 unless it eats an apple.

Wait no: Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe each move adds a new head without automatically removing the tail unless there's no apple eaten.

No, wait—wait, no. The standard snake game mechanics are:

- When you move, the head moves in the direction you choose.
- If you don't eat an apple, the tail follows (i.e., the last segment is removed to keep the length constant).
- If you do eat an apple, the tail doesn't follow; instead, the snake's length increases by one.

But in this scenario, since we're starting with just the head at (6,6), moving LEFT would add a new head at (5,6). But since there are no body segments behind, does that mean the snake's body is now [(5,6)]? Or do I have to think of it as the head moves and if there's no apple, the previous position becomes part of the body only if the length increases.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that until the snake eats an apple, each move just changes the head's position without adding any new segments (since the tail follows). So in our case, since we start with no body beyond the head, moving LEFT would make the head move to (5,6), and if there's no apple at (5,6), then that's just the new head; but wait, actually, the body would consist of all positions the snake has occupied in reverse order. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a queue.

Wait no: Maybe each time you move, the new position is added to the front of the list (the head), and if there's no apple, the last element (tail) is removed. So:

Initial state: body = [(6,6)]

Move 1: LEFT → new head at (5,6). Since not eating an apple, remove tail (6,6). Now body = [(5,6)].

Wait, but that would mean the snake's length remains 1. That can't be right because in standard snake, when you move, your body follows, so each step adds one to the head and removes one from the tail if no apple is eaten. But if you have a body longer than just the head, then yes.

Wait, but perhaps in this scenario, since we're starting with only the head, moving without eating an apple doesn't add any segments; it's as if the snake is just moving forward and leaving behind nothing except where it was before.

But I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try to model it step by step.

Initial body: [(6,6)] (head at front)
Apple at (0,0)

Move 1: LEFT → new head at (5,6). Since no apple here, remove the tail (6,6). Now body is [(5,6)]. But wait, that would mean the snake's body is now just at (5,6), which doesn't make sense because it should have a path. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body is represented.

Wait, maybe the body includes all positions from the head back to the tail, with each move adding the new head and removing the tail if no apple is eaten.

So:

Initial body: [(6,6)] (head at front)
Move 1: LEFT → new head at (5,6). Since no apple, remove last element (if any). But since there's only one element, after moving, the body becomes [(5,6)]. So the snake is now at (5,6) with no segments behind.

But that can't be right because then every move would just shift the snake forward without any body. I must have a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps in this problem's context, the initial snake has only the head, and each move adds a new segment at the head without automatically removing anything unless it's necessary to keep the length constant (which isn't applicable here since we're starting with no segments beyond the head).

Alternatively, maybe the body grows as you move, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should proceed under the assumption that until the apple is eaten, there's no collision risk because there are no body segments behind.

So, to reach (0,0) in 12 moves without any collisions except possibly with walls, but since we're moving in a grid, perhaps walls wrap around or not? Wait, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that the snake can't move beyond the grid's boundaries and will die if it tries to move outside. But for this path, all movements are within the grid.

So, with that in mind, the plan is:

12 moves: LEFT six times, then DOWN six times.

But wait, after moving LEFT six times, I'm at (0,6), current direction is LEFT. Then I need to change direction to DOWN, which is allowed because it's not the reverse of LEFT (which would be RIGHT).

So move 7: DOWN → (0,5)
Move 8: DOWN → (0,4)
...
Move 12: DOWN → (0,0)

Upon reaching (0,0), the snake eats the apple and grows by one segment. Now the body is [(6,6) to (0,6)] in some way, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

But since the problem only asks for a possible path, this should suffice.

Another consideration: The initial direction is DOWN, but moving LEFT isn't blocked because it's not the reverse of DOWN. Wait no: Wait, current direction is DOWN; can you change to LEFT without any restrictions? Or do you have to make turns in a way that doesn't involve reversing?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rules here. The rule says you cannot choose a direction that is the exact opposite of your current direction.

So if you're currently moving DOWN, next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (since UP is the reverse). Wait no: If current direction is DOWN, then the next move can't be UP because it's the opposite. But LEFT and RIGHT are allowed as they aren't opposites of DOWN.

Wait no: Are LEFT and RIGHT considered opposites? No, only the directions on the same axis are opposites. So LEFT and RIGHT are opposites on the x-axis; UP and DOWN are opposites on the y-axis.

So if you're moving LEFT (x-axis), next can't be RIGHT. If you're moving UP (y-axis), next can't be DOWN.

But when changing direction from, say, LEFT to DOWN, that's allowed because they're on different axes and not exact reverses.

Wait no: Wait, I think the rule is that you cannot make a 180-degree turn; you can't reverse direction. So if you were moving in one direction along an axis, you can't immediately move in the opposite direction along the same axis. But changing to a perpendicular direction (like LEFT to DOWN) is allowed.

So for example:

- If current direction is LEFT (x-axis), next can be UP or DOWN (y-axis), but not RIGHT.
- If current direction is DOWN (y-axis), next can be LEFT or RIGHT, but not UP.

This makes sense because it prevents the snake from turning around on itself immediately, which would cause collision with its own body if it's longer than one segment. But in our case, until we eat the apple, the snake is just a single segment moving, so collisions aren't an issue until after the first growth when the body has more than one segment.

Wait no: Wait, but even as a single segment, making a U-turn would require crossing over itself if there's any body behind. But since we're starting with only the head and no body segments, maybe it's allowed.

But in our path, after moving LEFT six times (current direction LEFT), we turn to DOWN, which is perpendicular, so it's allowed because it's not a reversal along the same axis.

So the path should be valid.

Another possible alternative: Instead of going all the way left then down, maybe go down first and then right. But that would require more moves since you'd have to go from (6,6) down to (6,0), then right to (7,0)... Wait no, wait, x=6, y=0 is not possible unless the grid wraps around. I'm assuming the grid doesn't wrap, so moving beyond x or y boundaries would result in death.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the snake can move any direction except the reverse of its current direction, regardless of axis.

Wait no: The rule says you cannot choose a direction that is the exact opposite of your current direction. So if you're moving LEFT (x-axis), next can't be RIGHT; if you're moving DOWN (y-axis), next can't be UP.

So from (6,6):

Move 1: DOWN → (6,5), current dir=DOWN
But that's not efficient because I want to reach (0,0) as quickly as possible. Going all the way left then down is more direct.

Wait no: Wait, in terms of minimal moves, moving diagonally isn't allowed; each move changes either x or y by one. So from (6,6), to get to (0,0), you need 6 moves left and 6 moves down, total of 12 moves. There's no diagonal movement.

So the path I proposed earlier is minimal in terms of number of moves: six LEFTs followed by six DOWNs.

But wait, maybe there's a way to interleave them to reach faster? No, because each move only changes one coordinate at a time, so you can't reduce the total number below 12.

So my initial path should be valid.

Another consideration: When changing direction from LEFT to DOWN, is that allowed under the movement rules?

Yes, because LEFT and DOWN are not opposite directions; they're perpendicular. The restriction only applies when trying to reverse along the same axis (like LEFT followed by RIGHT or DOWN followed by UP).

So the path should be acceptable.

Another alternative: Maybe using a different route with fewer turns, but I don't think that's possible here since you have to cover six units in both x and y directions.

Wait no: Wait, if I go down first, then right, then up, then left... No, that would take more moves. So the minimal path is 12 moves: 6 LEFTs and 6 DOWNs.

So the sequence would be:

(6,6) → (5,6) → (4,6) → ... → (0,6) → (0,5) → ... → (0,0).

Each move alternates between LEFT and DOWN once we reach (0,6). Wait no: After six LEFTs, you're at (0,6), then you need to go down six times.

But wait, after the sixth LEFT, you're at (0,6); moving DOWN would take you to (0,5), then (0,4), etc., until (0,0). So that's correct.

So in terms of movement commands:

LEFT ×6 followed by DOWN ×6.

Each move must not be the reverse of the current direction. Since after the first LEFT, the next moves are all LEFTs except for the last one, which switches to DOWN.

Wait no: After six LEFTs, you're at (0,6). Then the first DOWN is allowed because it's not a reversal of LEFT; LEFT and DOWN are perpendicular, so that's fine. From there, each subsequent DOWN continues in the same direction, so no problem.

So this path should work without violating any movement constraints until after the apple is eaten, at which point the snake would have more segments to worry about collision with itself. But since we're only focusing on reaching the apple, and not concerned with what happens afterward (like growing and moving further), this should suffice.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine a valid path for the snake to reach the target position (0,0) starting from (6,6) on a grid. The snake can move in four directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) but cannot reverse direction immediately (e.g., from LEFT to RIGHT or DOWN to UP).

### Approach
The optimal strategy is to minimize the number of moves by moving directly towards the target without unnecessary detours. The minimal path involves moving left six times and then down six times, as this covers both the x and y distances required in the fewest steps.

1. **Move Left Six Times**: This reduces the x-coordinate from 6 to 0.
2. **Move Down Six Times**: After reaching (0,6), moving down six times reduces the y-coordinate from 6 to 0.

This approach ensures that we reach the target in the minimal number of moves without violating any movement constraints.

### Solution Code
```python
# Define the directions as lists for easy access
directions = {
    'LEFT': [(-1, 0)],
    'RIGHT': [(1, 0)],
    'UP': [(0, 1)],
    'DOWN': [(0, -1)]
}

# Starting position
current_position = (6, 6)
target_position = (0, 0)

# List to keep track of the path
path = [current_position]

# Move LEFT six times
for _ in range(6):
    # Calculate new position
    current_position = (current_position[0] - 1, current_position[1])
    path.append(current_position)
    
    # Check if we've reached the target early
    if current_position == target_position:
        break

# If not yet at target, move DOWN six times
if current_position != target_position:
    for _ in range(6):
        current_position = (current_position[0], current_position[1] - 1)
        path.append(current_position)

print("Path taken:")
for pos in path:
    print(pos)
```

### Explanation
- **Direction Handling**: The snake moves in the LEFT direction six times, reducing its x-coordinate from 6 to 0. After reaching (0,6), it then changes direction to DOWN and moves six times to reduce its y-coordinate from 6 to 0.
- **Path Tracking**: Each move is recorded to show the exact path taken by the snake, ensuring clarity in how the target is reached efficiently.

This solution ensures that the snake reaches the target in the minimal number of steps while adhering to movement constraints.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (0, 0).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
