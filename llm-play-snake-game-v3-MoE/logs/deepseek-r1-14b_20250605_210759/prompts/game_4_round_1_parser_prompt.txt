========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I need to figure out how to move the snake from (5,5) to eat the apple at (3,8). Let's break this down step by step.

First, the current position of the head is (5,5), and the apple is at (3,8). So, the target is two units left and three units up from the head. 

Since the initial direction is NONE, I can choose any first move without worrying about reversing. The goal is to get to (3,8) safely, avoiding collisions with walls and body segments.

Looking at the grid, (5,5) needs to go left twice and up three times. But wait, the snake's body might interfere if it moves directly towards the apple because moving left from (5,5) would take it to (4,5), but I need to make sure that after each move, the body doesn't collide.

Also, considering the movement rules: when the head moves, the body follows. If the snake eats an apple, it grows without losing the tail. So, as long as the path is clear, moving directly towards the apple should be safe.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move LEFT to (4,5). Since there are no body segments mentioned, this is safe.
2. Then another LEFT to (3,5).
3. Now, move UP three times: first UP to (3,6), then again to (3,7), and finally to (3,8).

But wait, after moving to (3,5), I need to make sure that the body segments don't block the path when moving up. Since the initial body is empty, each move should be safe.

So, the sequence would be LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP, UP.

Let me check if this meets the movement rules and doesn't cause any collisions:

- Moving LEFT twice gets to (3,5). No collision because the body remains empty after these moves.
- Then moving UP three times: each move is safe as there's no body in those cells.

Also, after eating the apple, since it's the first step, the body will grow, but that shouldn't block the path. Plus, there's at least one legal move next turn because we can continue moving up or change direction if needed.

I think this plan is solid. So the moves are LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP, UP.
</think>

{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves directly left twice and then up three times to reach the apple at (3,8), ensuring no collisions as there are no body segments."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (3, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
