Hamiltonian Cycle Agent for Snake Game
=====================================

This module implements the Hamiltonian Cycle algorithm for Snake gameplay.
The Hamiltonian cycle is the most sophisticated Snake algorithm that guarantees
infinite survival by following a pre-computed cycle that visits every cell.

The algorithm works by:
1. Pre-computing a Hamiltonian cycle for the entire grid
2. Following this cycle to ensure the snake never gets trapped
3. Optionally taking shortcuts when safe to improve efficiency
4. Falling back to cycle following for guaranteed safety

Key Features:
- 100% survival guarantee (theoretically infinite game length)
- Pre-computed cycle generation for any grid size
- Intelligent shortcutting for efficiency
- Fallback safety mechanism

Design Patterns:
- Strategy Pattern: Interchangeable pathfinding algorithm
- Template Method: Consistent agent interface
- Precomputation Pattern: Generate cycle once, use many times

    This algorithm prioritizes survival over score optimization, making it
    ideal for demonstrating infinite play scenarios.

    - Strategy Pattern: Pluggable pathfinding algorithm
