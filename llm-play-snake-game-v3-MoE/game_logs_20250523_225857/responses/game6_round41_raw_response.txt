========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get this snake from (6,7) to eat the apple at (0,9). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (6,7), and it's currently facing LEFT. The body cells are [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. So, the snake is a bit coiled up in the middle of the grid. The apple is all the way at the top-right corner.

First, I should consider the movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction on the first move if it's moving in any direction other than NONE. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT away from that. So my initial options are to continue going LEFT or go UP or DOWN.

But wait, the snake's body is blocking some paths. Let me visualize the grid. The head is at (6,7). To its right is (7,7), which is part of the body. To the left is (5,7), and then down are other segments. So moving LEFT from (6,7) would take the snake to (5,7), but that's already a body segment. Wait, no—the body cells given are [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. So the head is at (6,7). If it moves LEFT, it would go to (5,7), which is part of the body. That's a collision. So moving LEFT isn't possible because it would collide with its own body.

Hmm, that's an issue. So maybe I need to change direction first before moving further. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT, but UP or DOWN are options.

Let me check the directions:

- UP: (6,7) → (6,8)
- DOWN: (6,7) → (6,6)
- LEFT: (5,7), which collides with body.
- RIGHT: Can't do because it's a reversal if we were moving LEFT.

Wait, no—the first move can be any direction except reversing unless it's the first step. Since the current direction is LEFT, moving RIGHT would be a reversal, so that's not allowed on the first move. So initial options are UP or DOWN.

Moving UP to (6,8) seems safer because it moves the snake upwards towards the apple. Let me see what happens next.

After moving UP, the new head is at (6,8). The body becomes [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. Wait, no—the body after a normal move would have the old head inserted and the tail removed. So if we moved UP, the new head is at (6,8). Then, since it's not eating an apple, the tail (which was (5,6)) is removed, so the body becomes [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,7)].

But then, the next move: from (6,8), possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Since we just moved UP, can't reverse by moving DOWN immediately. So options are LEFT or RIGHT.

Moving LEFT from (6,8) would take us to (5,8). Is that clear? Let's check the body. The current body after first move is [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]—no, wait, when moving UP, we just add the old head to the front and remove the tail. So new body would be [(6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]. Then, after moving UP, the tail was (5,6). Wait, no—the initial body is [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)], and when we move UP, the new head is (6,8), so we add that to the front of the body, making it [(6,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail, which was (5,6) before moving. Wait, no—the initial body is given as [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)], so after inserting the head and removing the tail, it becomes [(6,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]. Wait, no—the initial body is BODY = [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)], and the head is (6,7). So when we move UP, new_head is (6,8).

Then, in step 3a: Insert old head (6,7) at front of BODY. So BODY becomes [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. Then, since new_head is not apple, we remove the last element, which was (5,7). So new body is [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)].

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should think of it as:

- Original head: (6,7)
- Body: [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]
- After moving UP:
   - new_head = (6,8)
   - Insert old head into body: BODY becomes [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]
   - Remove tail (which is the last element before growth. Since no apple was eaten, we remove (5,7). So new body is [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)].

So now, the snake is longer and needs to navigate towards the apple at (0,9).

Next move: from (6,8), possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would take us to (5,8). Let's check if that's blocked by body.

Current body after first move is [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]. So at (5,8), there's nothing blocking—safe to move. Then the new head would be (5,8).

Then, in step 3a: insert old head (6,8) at front of body, making it [(6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]. Then remove the tail if not eating apple. So new body is [(6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)].

Continuing this way seems tedious, but perhaps a better approach is to plan the path towards the apple while avoiding collisions and reversing directions only when necessary.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT from the initial position isn't possible because of the body. Wait, no—the head is at (6,7), and if it moves RIGHT to (7,7), which is part of the body. So that's a collision. Therefore, the first move cannot be RIGHT.

So after the first move UP, moving LEFT or DOWN could be options. Let me try moving UP again.

From (6,8), possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving UP again would take us to (6,9). But is that near the apple? The apple is at (0,9), so we need to get all the way left.

But moving UP further might not be efficient. Maybe a better approach is to move in a way that gradually turns the snake towards the apple without reversing direction until necessary.

Wait, but after moving UP, the next moves can't reverse. So from (6,8), if I go LEFT again, it's allowed since the last direction was UP. Then, from (5,8), directions can be LEFT or DOWN or something else.

But this seems like it might take a while. Maybe there's a smarter path.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a circular pattern around the apple could work. Since the apple is at (0,9), which is on the top row, the snake needs to move leftwards and then upwards.

Wait, but after some moves, the snake will have to turn directions without reversing. For example, if the snake is moving UP, it can't immediately reverse to DOWN, but after a few UP moves, it could start moving LEFT or RIGHT.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake should make a U-turn by moving UP and then LEFT, but ensuring that it doesn't collide with its body.

Wait, let's think about the initial position:

Head at (6,7), facing LEFT. Body segments are [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. So if we move UP to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), and then LEFT again to (4,8), and so on until reaching the top.

But let me check if that's possible without reversing direction. The first move is UP, which is allowed. Then moving LEFT is allowed because the last direction was UP. Moving LEFT again is allowed as long as it's not a reversal from the previous direction.

Wait, no—reversal refers to changing from left to right or vice versa. So after moving UP (north), moving LEFT (west) isn't a reversal. Similarly, after moving LEFT, can we then move DOWN? That would be a reversal because from west to south is like turning around.

But maybe it's better to plan a path that allows the snake to turn left without reversing directions until needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake needs to make a 180-degree turn, but that would require reversing direction, which isn't allowed on the first move.

Wait, no—reversing direction is only prohibited if it's the first step. After the first step, you can reverse.

For example: initial direction is LEFT. Then moving UP is okay, then moving DOWN is a reversal and is allowed after that.

But making such moves might be necessary to reach the apple.

Alternatively, maybe the snake should move in a spiral towards the top-right corner.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to sketch a grid or something.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Start at (6,7), direction LEFT.
2. First move: UP to (6,8). Direction now is UP.
3. Next moves can't reverse from UP, so directions allowed are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But moving DOWN from (6,8) would take us back towards the starting area, which might not be helpful.

Alternatively, moving LEFT again:

3. From (6,8), move LEFT to (5,8). Direction now is LEFT.
4. Next moves can't reverse from LEFT, so allowed directions are LEFT or DOWN.

Continuing this way:

4. From (5,8), move LEFT to (4,8).
5. Then LEFT to (3,8), then (2,8), then (1,8). Now at column 1, row 8.

From there, can we move UP? Wait, from (1,8), moving UP would take us to (1,9), which is close to the apple at (0,9).

But we need to get to (0,9). So perhaps after reaching (1,8), we can move LEFT again:

Wait, but if we're at (1,8) facing LEFT, that's column 1. Moving LEFT would take us out of the grid, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, from (1,8), maybe change direction to UP or DOWN.

But since our goal is at (0,9), we need to get leftwards and then upwards.

Wait, but after reaching (1,8), moving UP to (1,9). Then, from there, can we move LEFT? No, because that would go beyond the grid. So perhaps from (1,9), we can't proceed further.

Alternatively, maybe at some point before that, change direction.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of moving all the way left to column 1, we could have made a different turn earlier.

Wait, another approach: after moving UP and then LEFT several times, reach near the top-left, then move RIGHT towards the apple.

But let's see:

After step 4, at (4,8). Then, from there, can we move DOWN? That would be reversing direction from LEFT to DOWN, which is allowed since it's not the first step. So moving DOWN to (4,7).

Then, from (4,7), possible directions are UP or LEFT or RIGHT.

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is:

1. Move UP to (6,8).
2. Then move LEFT all the way to (0,8).
3. Then move UP twice to reach (0,10) which isn't possible because the grid goes up to 9.
Wait, the grid coordinates go from 0 to 8 in both x and y? Or is it 0-7?

Assuming it's a 9x9 grid with coordinates from (0,0) to (8,8), then (0,9) would be out of bounds. Wait, maybe the apple is at (0,8). But the problem says (0,9). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should just outline a possible path:

1. Move UP: (6,7) → (6,8)
2. Move LEFT: (6,8) → (5,8)
3. Move LEFT: (5,8) → (4,8)
4. Move LEFT: (4,8) → (3,8)
5. Move LEFT: (3,8) → (2,8)
6. Move LEFT: (2,8) → (1,8)
7. Now at (1,8). Next, can we move UP? Let's see.

From (1,8), moving UP to (1,9) is as close as possible to the apple. But the apple is at (0,9), so maybe from here, it's not directly reachable without another turn.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 6, at (2,8), instead of moving LEFT again, move DOWN:

7. Move DOWN: (2,8) → (2,7)
But that might take us away from the target.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is needed.

Wait, maybe we should consider turning directions when necessary without reversing.

For example:

1. Start at (6,7), direction LEFT.
2. First move: UP to (6,8).
3. Next, instead of moving LEFT again, move RIGHT? Wait, but from (6,8) with direction UP, can't move RIGHT immediately because it's a reversal from UP to RIGHT.

Alternatively, after UP, move DOWN to (6,7). But that's the original position.

Wait, perhaps not useful.

Alternatively, maybe the snake should make a U-turn:

From (6,7), first move: UP to (6,8).

Then, move LEFT twice to reach column 4 or something, then move UP again, but this seems unclear.

Alternatively, let me think about the minimal path. The snake needs to get from (6,7) to (0,9). So it has to move left 6 units and up 2 units.

But considering the body segments, it can't just plow through itself. It needs to coil in a way that allows movement towards the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake should move UP first, then LEFT as much as possible, then UP again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that after some moves, the snake can turn around without colliding with itself.

But this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to outline specific steps:

1. (6,7) → (6,8) [UP]
2. (6,8) → (5,8) [LEFT]
3. (5,8) → (4,8) [LEFT]
4. (4,8) → (3,8) [LEFT]
5. (3,8) → (2,8) [LEFT]
6. (2,8) → (1,8) [LEFT]

Now at (1,8). Next possible directions: LEFT is out of grid, so can move UP or DOWN.

Moving UP to (1,9), but apple is at (0,9). Can't reach it from here.

Alternatively, perhaps from (2,8), instead of moving all the way left, move down and then right.

But that might not be efficient.

Wait, maybe after step 5, at (3,8), we can start moving DOWN to turn around:

5. Move LEFT to (2,8).
6. Then move DOWN to (2,7).
7. Then LEFT again? But let's see.

From (2,7), directions allowed: since last was LEFT, so can't reverse to RIGHT immediately. So options are LEFT or DOWN.

But moving LEFT from (2,7) would take us back towards the starting area.

Alternatively, maybe from (2,8), move DOWN twice:

6. From (3,8) → (3,7)
7. Then, from (3,7) → (3,6)
Then, move RIGHT to get closer to the apple.

But this is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps a better approach is to accept that the snake needs to make several turns without colliding with itself and plan accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the initial path isn't feasible, so another first move is needed. Instead of moving UP first, perhaps moving DOWN could be better.

Wait, let's try:

1. (6,7) → (6,6) [DOWN]
But then, since current direction is LEFT, moving DOWN would be a reversal from LEFT to DOWN, which is allowed on the first move.

Then, new head at (6,6). Now, check if that's blocked by body: original body was [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. So moving DOWN would take us to (6,6), which is part of the body. So that's a collision.

So moving DOWN first isn't possible because it would collide with the body at (6,6).

Therefore, initial move must be UP.

So, back to the previous idea:

1. Move UP: (6,7) → (6,8)
2. Then LEFT all the way to (0,8)
3. Then UP as much as possible

But from (0,8), moving UP would take us beyond the grid, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps after reaching near the top, we can move RIGHT towards the apple.

Wait, but the apple is at (0,9). So maybe:

1. Move UP: (6,7) → (6,8)
2. Move LEFT: (6,8) → (5,8)
3. Continue LEFT to (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)

At (1,8). Now, can we move UP? Yes:

4. (1,8) → (1,9)

But the apple is at (0,9). So from here, we need to get closer.

Alternatively, perhaps before moving all the way left, make a detour.

Wait, maybe after step 3: (3,8), move DOWN twice:

4. (3,8) → (3,7)
5. (3,7) → (3,6)

Then, from here, can we move RIGHT towards the apple?

But moving RIGHT would take us away from column 0.

Wait, no—if we're at (3,6), and want to reach (0,9), that's not directly possible without more moves.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 3: (4,8) → (5,8)? No, that's going back towards the start.

This is really tricky. Maybe there's a specific path that avoids self-collision.

Alternatively, perhaps the snake needs to make a U-turn by moving in opposite directions without reversing.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows the snake to move through its own body as long as it doesn't get stuck. But I don't think so—usually, snakes can't overlap themselves.

Given that, perhaps the only way is for the snake to make a detour and loop around the head, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe after moving UP once, then LEFT all the way, then UP again as much as possible.

Wait, let me try:

1. (6,7) → (6,8) [UP]
2. (6,8) → (5,8) [LEFT]
3. (5,8) → (4,8)
4. (4,8) → (3,8)
5. (3,8) → (2,8)
6. (2,8) → (1,8)
7. (1,8) → (1,9) [UP]

But as mentioned earlier, this gets stuck at (1,9).

Alternatively, maybe from (2,8), instead of moving LEFT to (1,8), move DOWN:

6. (2,8) → (2,7)
7. Then move RIGHT: (2,7) → (3,7)
But that's going away.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is needed.

Wait, maybe after step 4: (4,8), instead of moving LEFT again, move DOWN:

5. (4,8) → (4,7)
6. Then, from (4,7), can we move RIGHT?

But moving RIGHT would take us towards column 0.

Alternatively, perhaps this path isn't working.

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe the key is to realize that after certain moves, the snake can turn around by reversing direction without overlapping itself.

For example:

1. (6,7) → (6,8) [UP]
2. (6,8) → (5,8) [LEFT]
3. (5,8) → (4,8)
4. (4,8) → (3,8)
5. (3,8) → (2,8)
6. (2,8) → (1,8)
7. Now at (1,8), can we reverse direction to DOWN?

From (1,8), moving DOWN would take us to (1,7).

But that doesn't help much.

Alternatively, from (1,8), perhaps move LEFT again? But that's out of the grid.

Wait, maybe after step 5: at (2,8). Move DOWN:

6. (2,8) → (2,7)
7. Then, move RIGHT to (3,7)
8. Then move RIGHT to (4,7), etc., but this is moving away from the target.

Alternatively, perhaps after reaching near the top-left, use a different strategy.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem might have a standard solution where the snake moves in a spiral or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal path involves moving UP once, then LEFT all the way, then UP again as much as possible.

But let's count:

From (6,7) to (6,8): 1 move

Then, from (6,8) to (0,8): 6 moves (left)

Then, from (0,8), can't go further left. So need another strategy.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving LEFT all the way to (0,8), then move UP once to (0,9). But that's the target!

Wait, yes! From (0,8), if we could move UP to (0,9), which is the apple, but can we?

Because from (0,8), moving UP would take us beyond the grid. Unless the grid allows y=9.

Assuming it does:

1. (6,7) → (6,8)
2. Then, move LEFT 6 times to reach (0,8)
3. Then, move UP once to (0,9)

That's three moves? Wait:

Wait, moving from (6,8) to (5,8): 1

(5,8) → (4,8): 2

(4,8) → (3,8): 3

(3,8) → (2,8): 4

(2,8) → (1,8): 5

(1,8) → (0,8): 6

Then, from (0,8), move UP to (0,9): 7th move.

But the problem states that the apple is at (0,9). So yes, that's possible.

Wait, but when moving from (0,8) to (0,9), does the snake collide with itself?

Because originally, the body was at [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. Wait, no—the initial position is (6,7). The body is presumably in front of it.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the movement. In snake games, each move extends the head and retracts the tail. So when moving, the snake can't overlap itself.

But in this problem, we're only told to find a path where the snake doesn't collide with its own body.

So, the snake must not have any overlapping segments at any point.

Given that, if the snake moves from (6,7) → (6,8), then proceeds to move left, it's creating a new head at each step without overlapping itself because it's moving in a new direction.

Similarly, when moving left all the way to (0,8), the body is following behind, so as long as no two segments overlap, it's fine.

Then, from (0,8), moving UP once would take it to (0,9). Since the snake can extend beyond its current length, but in reality, each segment follows the path. However, since the problem doesn't specify whether the tail is shortened or not, perhaps it's assumed that the snake can move freely without worrying about the tail.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can only move by extending its head and retracting a tail, so after moving 7 times, it's at (0,9).

But I think for this problem, we just need to count the minimal number of moves required to reach (0,9) without overlapping any previous segments.

So, based on that:

1. Move UP: (6,7) → (6,8)
2. Move LEFT 6 times: each move reduces x by 1.
3. Then, move UP once: y increases by 1.

Total moves: 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 moves.

But wait, is that the minimal?

Alternatively, maybe a different path can reach (0,9) in fewer moves without overlapping.

For example:

If the snake could somehow make a diagonal, but it's restricted to moving only up or left (or down or right), I think.

Wait, no—snakes can only move in one direction at a time. So each move is either UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.

Therefore, to reach from (6,7) to (0,9), the minimal path involves moving 6 steps LEFT and 2 steps UP, totaling 8 moves.

But let's confirm if this is possible without overlapping.

Assuming that after each left move, the snake can extend its head further left without overlapping itself because it's a new segment.

Similarly, when changing direction from LEFT to UP, as long as it doesn't create overlap with previous segments.

So, in this case:

1. Start at (6,7)
2. Move UP: (6,8)
3. Then move LEFT 6 times:
   - (5,8)
   - (4,8)
   - (3,8)
   - (2,8)
   - (1,8)
   - (0,8)
4. Then move UP once: (0,9)

At each step, the snake's body is extending left and then up without overlapping itself because it's creating a new path.

Therefore, this should be possible in 8 moves.

But let me see if there's a shorter path.

Wait, after moving UP to (6,8), can we somehow move RIGHT? No, that would take us back towards the starting point.

Alternatively, perhaps by making some DOWN moves and then UP again, but that might not help.

For example:

1. (6,7) → (6,8)
2. (6,8) → (5,8)
3. (5,8) → (4,8)
...
This seems necessary because to reach x=0, the snake needs to move left 6 times, and then up once.

So total moves: 1 (UP) + 6 (LEFT) + 1 (UP) = 8.

I think that's the minimal number of moves required.
</think>

To solve the problem of moving from position (6,7) to (0,9) without overlapping the snake's body, the snake must take a path consisting of three main segments: first moving up, then left, and finally up again. This results in a total of 8 moves.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** The snake starts at (6,7).
2. **First Move - Up:** Moves to (6,8). This is the first move.
3. **Next Six Moves - Left:** Each move reduces the x-coordinate by 1:
   - (5,8)
   - (4,8)
   - (3,8)
   - (2,8)
   - (1,8)
   - (0,8). This is the 6th and 7th moves.
4. **Final Move - Up:** Moves from (0,8) to (0,9). This is the 8th move.

By following this path, the snake reaches its target without overlapping any part of its body.

**Answer:** The minimal number of moves required is \boxed{8}.
