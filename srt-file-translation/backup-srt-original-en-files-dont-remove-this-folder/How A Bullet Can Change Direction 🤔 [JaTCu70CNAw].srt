if you shoot a gun with a smart bullet
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,749
if you shoot a gun with a smart bullet
inside it can actually change direction

00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759
inside it can actually change direction
 

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,350
inside it can actually change direction
after being fired it works because of

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:08,360
after being fired it works because of
 

7
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,190
after being fired it works because of
tiny sensors on the inside that gather

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
tiny sensors on the inside that gather
 

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,549
tiny sensors on the inside that gather
data about the bullet's surroundings

10
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:13,559
data about the bullet's surroundings
 

11
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,269
data about the bullet's surroundings
once the target is identified the sensor

12
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:16,279
once the target is identified the sensor
 

13
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,429
once the target is identified the sensor
rapidly sends information to Tiny fins

14
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
rapidly sends information to Tiny fins
 

15
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,349
rapidly sends information to Tiny fins
on the body of the bullet and these fins

16
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:22,359
on the body of the bullet and these fins
 

17
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,269
on the body of the bullet and these fins
adjust changing the flight path midair

18
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
adjust changing the flight path midair
 

19
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,760
adjust changing the flight path midair
to hit the target
