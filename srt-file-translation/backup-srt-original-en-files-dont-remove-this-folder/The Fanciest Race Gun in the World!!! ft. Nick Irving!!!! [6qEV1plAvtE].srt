661
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,190
inside there it's just it dries very
spongy like that so it's pretty dense

662
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
spongy like that so it's pretty dense
 

663
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,069
spongy like that so it's pretty dense
pretty soft

664
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
pretty soft
 

665
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,590
pretty soft
it's self-healing so if a bullet does

666
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
it's self-healing so if a bullet does
 

667
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,110
it's self-healing so if a bullet does
pass through like

668
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
pass through like
 

669
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,190
pass through like
it'll close in after it so we're gonna

670
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
it'll close in after it so we're gonna
 

671
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,870
it'll close in after it so we're gonna
see we actually have

672
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
see we actually have
 

673
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,710
see we actually have
a lot of these we've got seven of them

674
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
a lot of these we've got seven of them
 

675
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,990
a lot of these we've got seven of them
we're gonna line them all up

676
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
we're gonna line them all up
 

677
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,470
we're gonna line them all up
see how many it takes to stop a nine

678
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
see how many it takes to stop a nine
 

679
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,590
see how many it takes to stop a nine
millimeter full metal

680
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
millimeter full metal
 

681
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,790
millimeter full metal
jacket i think it is stop three one nine

682
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
jacket i think it is stop three one nine
 

683
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,790
jacket i think it is stop three one nine
three of those so you think it'll be

684
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
three of those so you think it'll be
 

685
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,069
three of those so you think it'll be
stopped in the third

686
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
stopped in the third
 

687
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,069
stopped in the third
yes sir okay i think it's gonna go

688
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
yes sir okay i think it's gonna go
 

689
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,829
yes sir okay i think it's gonna go
through

690
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
through
 

691
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,670
through
i think it's gonna stop in the sixth

692
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
i think it's gonna stop in the sixth
 

693
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,910
i think it's gonna stop in the sixth
really yeah double

694
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
really yeah double
 

695
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,350
really yeah double
let's find out what also is weird about

696
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
let's find out what also is weird about
 

697
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,110
let's find out what also is weird about
this is it's squishy like if i

698
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
this is it's squishy like if i
 

699
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,110
this is it's squishy like if i
push my thumb down it'll go all the way

700
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
push my thumb down it'll go all the way
 

701
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,030
push my thumb down it'll go all the way
to the bottom and then it comes back

702
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
to the bottom and then it comes back
 

703
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,069
to the bottom and then it comes back
but if you try to hit it it stops

704
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
but if you try to hit it it stops
 

705
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,190
but if you try to hit it it stops
like it gets hard when it's hit fast i

706
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
like it gets hard when it's hit fast i
 

707
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,550
like it gets hard when it's hit fast i
don't know what kind of glue this is

708
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
don't know what kind of glue this is
 

709
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,470
don't know what kind of glue this is
like i said i didn't make it but it's

710
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
like i said i didn't make it but it's
 

711
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,590
like i said i didn't make it but it's
interesting

712
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
interesting
 

713
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,310
interesting
all right all seven lined up it's gonna

714
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
all right all seven lined up it's gonna
 

715
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,389
all right all seven lined up it's gonna
stop right there in the sixth we

716
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
stop right there in the sixth we
 

717
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,269
stop right there in the sixth we
are gonna fire one round through the

718
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
are gonna fire one round through the
 

719
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,550
are gonna fire one round through the
glue

720
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
glue
 

721
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,350
glue
and just see what happens little hole

722
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
and just see what happens little hole
 

723
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,470
and just see what happens little hole
right there

724
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
right there
 

725
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,710
right there
it definitely did not go all the way

726
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
it definitely did not go all the way
 

727
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,269
it definitely did not go all the way
through so where is it

728
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
through so where is it
 

729
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,870
through so where is it
i don't see i see a hole there still

730
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
i don't see i see a hole there still
 

731
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,470
i don't see i see a hole there still
going here

732
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
going here
 

733
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,870
going here
oh oh there's another one yeah still

734
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
oh oh there's another one yeah still
 

735
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,750
oh oh there's another one yeah still
going up

736
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
going up
 

737
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,629
going up
oh wow look how cool that is

738
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
oh wow look how cool that is
 

739
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,590
oh wow look how cool that is
wow so stuck in the fourth you were

740
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
wow so stuck in the fourth you were
 

741
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,150
wow so stuck in the fourth you were
closer

742
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
closer
 

743
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,069
closer
that is neat how crazy is that so that's

744
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
that is neat how crazy is that so that's
 

745
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,350
that is neat how crazy is that so that's
kind of like ballistics gel i mean

746
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
kind of like ballistics gel i mean
 

747
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,629
kind of like ballistics gel i mean
that's what it does it just

748
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
that's what it does it just
 

749
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,190
that's what it does it just
shows where it stops that is sweet i

750
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
shows where it stops that is sweet i
 

751
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,629
shows where it stops that is sweet i
just had a good idea so i put it back in

752
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
just had a good idea so i put it back in
 

753
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,310
just had a good idea so i put it back in
there it's still number four

754
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
there it's still number four
 

755
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,550
there it's still number four
i want to shoot a bunch of them in here

756
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
i want to shoot a bunch of them in here
 

757
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,750
i want to shoot a bunch of them in here
and then see what it looks like so we'll

758
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
and then see what it looks like so we'll
 

759
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,990
and then see what it looks like so we'll
just like dump a mag into it

760
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
just like dump a mag into it
 

761
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,990
just like dump a mag into it
and they should probably be mostly all

762
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
and they should probably be mostly all
 

763
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,509
and they should probably be mostly all
around that fourth one but some might be

764
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
around that fourth one but some might be
 

765
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,430
around that fourth one but some might be
third some might be fifth

766
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
third some might be fifth
 

767
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,590
third some might be fifth
that's science guys we're just a regular

768
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
that's science guys we're just a regular
 

769
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,629
that's science guys we're just a regular
science channel

770
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
science channel
 

771
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,790
science channel
no need to demonetize us

772
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800

 

773
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,670

dude you're putting those like in a dime

774
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
dude you're putting those like in a dime
 

775
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,790
dude you're putting those like in a dime
which is cool because that means the

776
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
which is cool because that means the
 

777
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,310
which is cool because that means the
[\h__\h] will run into each other

778
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320

 

779
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,189

hold that one low yeah pull it a little

780
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
hold that one low yeah pull it a little
 

781
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,670
hold that one low yeah pull it a little
oh that was it

782
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
oh that was it
 

783
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,670
oh that was it
oh one more one more wonder if you're

784
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
oh one more one more wonder if you're
 

785
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,269
oh one more one more wonder if you're
all dude no there's more

786
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
all dude no there's more
 

787
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,189
all dude no there's more
i don't you know what i think i am doing

788
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
i don't you know what i think i am doing
 

789
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,110
i don't you know what i think i am doing
you're flipping that safety i am

790
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120
you're flipping that safety i am
 

791
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,710
you're flipping that safety i am
it's very delicate

792
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
it's very delicate
 

793
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,910
it's very delicate
there you go nice so nick is doing

794
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
there you go nice so nick is doing
 

795
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,910
there you go nice so nick is doing
this he's hitting it with that and so

796
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
this he's hitting it with that and so
 

797
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,590
this he's hitting it with that and so
that's a training thing

798
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
that's a training thing
 

799
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,269
that's a training thing
which i remember learning on my other

800
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
which i remember learning on my other
 

801
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,949
which i remember learning on my other
2011 that you learn

802
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
2011 that you learn
 

803
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,629
2011 that you learn
to always have downward pressure on that

804
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
to always have downward pressure on that
 

805
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,990
to always have downward pressure on that
safety when you're firing

806
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
safety when you're firing
 

807
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,870
safety when you're firing
so you don't rise up turn your safety on

808
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
so you don't rise up turn your safety on
 

809
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,949
so you don't rise up turn your safety on
so before you started dumping at the end

810
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
so before you started dumping at the end
 

811
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,750
so before you started dumping at the end
you were like just cutting up that spot

812
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
you were like just cutting up that spot
 

813
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,629
you were like just cutting up that spot
right there

814
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
right there
 

815
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,870
right there
so let's pull the tape off let's see

816
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
so let's pull the tape off let's see
 

817
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,350
so let's pull the tape off let's see
what we got oh look

818
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
what we got oh look
 

819
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,230
what we got oh look
dude that is so cool nothing in the

820
