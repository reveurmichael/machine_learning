<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the snake can get from (5,6) to (7,6) without dying. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

The head is at (5,6), and the apple is two units to the right at (7,6). The snake's body is a long line starting from (0,5) up to (5,1), including the segment just before the head which is (5,5) according to the body list. Wait, no—actually, looking at the body cells: [(0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]. So the snake's head is at (5,6) and the next segment is (5,5). That means if I move up from the head, it would collide with its own body because moving up from (5,6) would be (5,7), but that's outside the grid since y can only go up to 9? Wait no, in the coordinate system, UP increases y by 1. So (5,6) moving up is (5,7). The grid goes up to (9,9), so that's fine. But I need to check if the new head position would collide with any body part.

Wait, but the current direction is "UP". So the next move can't be DOWN because of rule 3. So from UP, the first move can't be DOWN. That might affect the path.

The snake's body is along (5,1) up to (5,5). So if I'm moving towards the right, that's (6,6), but wait, no—the apple is at (7,6). Wait, the head is at (5,6), and the apple is two steps to the right. But let me visualize this.

The snake is in a vertical line along x=0 from y=1 up to y=5, then it turns into a horizontal line on y=1 from x=0 to x=4, then jumps back up to (5,2) and so on? Wait no—looking at the body cells: starting from (0,5), moving down to (0,4), ..., down to (0,1). Then it moves right to (1,1), then (2,1), etc., up to (5,1). Then it goes up to (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). So the body is like an L-shape: a vertical line from (0,5) down to (0,1), then a horizontal line to (5,1), and then moving back up along x=5 from y=2 to y=5. Hmm.

So if I move right from (5,6), the next head would be at (6,6). Is that safe? Let's check body cells: The body is at (5,5) as the last segment before the head. So moving right from (5,6) to (6,6)—that's not overlapping with any body cell except maybe if there's a segment at (6, something), but looking at the body list, I don't see any (6,x). So that seems safe.

But wait, after moving right once, the tail doesn't shrink because we didn't eat an apple yet. Wait, no—only when you eat the apple does the tail stay. Otherwise, each move shifts the body. So if the snake is moving towards the apple and hasn't eaten it yet, then the body would shift normally.

But in this case, since the apple is two steps to the right, maybe a straight path is possible.

Let me think about the direction constraints. The current direction is "UP", so the next move can't be DOWN. So from UP, I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or stay? Wait no—the directions are either change in direction or continue. But movement rules say that you cannot reverse direction immediately. So if current direction is UP, next move can't be DOWN. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again? Or wait, the current direction is "UP", so next move must not be opposite—so moving in any other allowed direction except DOWN.

So from (5,6), initial direction is UP. So first move cannot be DOWN.

The apple is at (7,6). The head needs to move right twice to reach there. Let's see the possible path.

Option 1: Move RIGHT twice.

First move: RIGHT from (5,6) → (6,6). Is that safe? Check body cells—does any part of the body block this? Looking at the current body, which is up to (5,5), so no overlap. So yes, it's safe.

Second move: Move RIGHT again to (7,6)—the apple position. Then eat the apple, and the snake grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't shrink after that. But wait, in this case, since we are at the apple, after moving into (7,6), the body would have grown, but for now, let's focus on the movement.

But wait, after moving to (6,6), what's next? Because each move shifts the body. Let me think about how the body moves.

When the snake moves, the head moves in the new direction, and each body segment follows the previous one. So after moving RIGHT once, the new head is at (6,6). The old head (5,6) becomes part of the body, so the body now includes all previous segments plus this new one.

So the body would have segments from (0,5) down to (0,1), then right to (5,1), up to (5,2), etc., and now including (5,6), (6,6).

But wait, no—the head was at (5,6). After moving RIGHT, the new head is (6,6). The body segments that were previously part of the snake would shift: the last segment (tail) is removed unless an apple is eaten. So in this case, since we're just moving towards the apple but haven't eaten it yet, the tail at (0,5) would be removed.

Wait no—the body list given includes all segments except the head. So after moving once, the new head is (6,6), and the old head (5,6) becomes part of the body. But the body cells provided are up to (5,5). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that each move adds the new head position and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So initially, the snake's body is as given: [(0,5), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]. So after moving to (6,6), the new head is (6,6), and the body becomes [old_head] + all previous body cells except the tail.

Wait no—the movement rule says that when you move, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten. Since in this first move, we haven't eaten the apple yet, so the tail (which would be (0,5)) is removed, but since the body cells given are up to (5,5), I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that each time you move, the head moves, and all body segments follow. So the new position of each body segment is the previous one's position. The tail is then removed unless an apple was eaten.

So after moving once to (6,6), the body would consist of all current body cells except the last one (which is the old tail) plus the new head.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

The key is that when the snake moves towards the apple without eating it yet, each move shifts the body forward and removes the tail. So after two moves to the right, the snake's body would have shifted accordingly.

So moving RIGHT twice seems possible, but let's check if any of those positions would cause a collision with the body.

First move: (5,6) → (6,6). The new head is at (6,6), and the body now includes all previous cells except the last one. Looking at the original body cells, none are at x=6 or y=6, so no collision.

Second move: (6,6) → (7,6). Now, check if any part of the body is in (7,6). The new head is at (7,6), and the body after first move was [(0,5), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]. So when moving to (7,6), is there any segment that would be in (7,6)? No, because the body after first move doesn't include x=6 except at y=6, which is the new head.

Wait no—the body after first move includes the previous head at (5,6) as part of the body. So when moving to (6,6), the body becomes [(0,5), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]. Then, after moving again to (7,6), the new head is at (7,6), and the body now includes all previous cells except the last one (which was (0,5) after first move). Wait no—it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each step:

Initial position:
Head: (5,6)
Body: [(0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]

Move 1: RIGHT → (6,6)
New head: (6,6)
Body becomes [ (5,6), (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]

Wait no—the body shifts so each segment takes the position of the previous one. So the old head (5,6) is now part of the body, and all other segments shift forward.

So after moving right once:

Body: [ (5,6), (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]

Wait that doesn't make sense because (5,6) is part of the body now. So when checking for collisions, any new head position must not be in the current body.

But wait, after moving to (6,6), the body includes all previous segments except the last one. Hmm, I'm getting confused about how the body updates.

Maybe it's better to think that each move adds a new segment at the head and removes one from the tail unless an apple is eaten.

So initial body: B = [ (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ]
Head: H = (5,6)

After moving RIGHT once:
New head: (6,6)
Body becomes B + [H] → but no, because the tail is removed unless apple eaten. So since we didn't eat an apple yet, the tail is removed.

Wait, movement rule says that after each move, the new head is added and the tail is removed except when eating the apple.

So for a normal move (not eating apple), body becomes [H_new] + B[:-1]

In this case:

After moving to (6,6):

Body: [ (5,6) ] + [ (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]

So the body now includes (5,6) as the first segment and all previous segments except (5,5). So the new body is [(5,6), (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)].

Now, when moving again to the right:

New head: (7,6)

Check if this position is in the current body. The current body after first move includes (5,6) and others, but none at (7,6). So it's safe.

So moving RIGHT twice seems possible.

But wait, what about the direction constraints? The initial direction is UP, so the next move cannot be DOWN. Moving RIGHT is allowed as it's not opposite to UP.

After first move: direction becomes RIGHT.

Second move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction. So from RIGHT, you can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. But moving RIGHT again is fine.

So after two moves, the snake reaches (7,6), eats the apple, and grows by one segment. Then, the tail doesn't shrink on the next move.

Wait no—the problem says that when eating the apple, the body grows by 1 segment, so the tail isn't removed in that step. So after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by one.

But in our case, we're only moving twice to reach the apple. Let me think:

First move: (5,6) → (6,6), not eating apple yet.

Second move: (6,6) → (7,6). At this point, the head is at (7,6), which is where the apple is. So after moving into (7,6), the snake eats the apple and grows by one segment.

So the body after eating would be:

Head: (7,6)

Body after first move was [(5,6), (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)].

After moving to (7,6) and eating apple, the tail isn't removed. So body becomes [ (7,6) ] + previous body except last segment? Or wait, no—the movement is that after moving into the apple, you add a new segment at the head without removing the tail.

Wait, the problem says: "the tail is removed unless apple is eaten". So when you eat the apple, the tail isn't removed. Therefore, in this case, since we're eating the apple on the second move, the body after that would be [ (7,6), (5,6), (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ].

So no collision occurs because none of these segments are at (7,6).

Therefore, moving RIGHT twice is safe and valid.

But wait—could there be any other issue? For example, when moving into (7,6), the new head is added to the body, but in this case, since we're eating the apple, the tail isn't removed. So the body length increases by one.

So the movement plan of RIGHT twice seems valid.

Alternatively, let's consider another approach: what if we move UP or DOWN? The initial direction is UP, so moving down would reverse direction. But that's not necessary here.

Wait no—moving in any direction other than DOWN after initial UP isn't a problem unless it reverses the direction.

But since the apple is directly to the right, it's more efficient to go there.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, the snake grows, so future movements could potentially collide with its own body. But in this case, we're only moving twice, and the second move results in eating the apple, so that's our goal.

So, the conclusion is that moving RIGHT twice would allow the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its own body.
</think>

The optimal path for the snake to reach the apple located at (7,6) involves moving right twice. 

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Position**:
   - Head: (5,6)
   - Body: [(0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]

2. **First Move - RIGHT**:
   - New Head Position: (6,6)
   - Since no apple is eaten yet, the tail segment at (0,5) is removed.
   - Updated Body: [(5,6), (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]

3. **Second Move - RIGHT**:
   - New Head Position: (7,6)
   - The snake moves into the apple's position.
   - Upon eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment; thus, no tail is removed.
   - Updated Body: [(7,6), (5,6), (0,5), (0,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]

The path doesn't result in any collisions with the body segments and successfully reaches the apple.

**Answer**: The snake should move right twice.
