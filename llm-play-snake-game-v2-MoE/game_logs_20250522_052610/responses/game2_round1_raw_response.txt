========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out how to plan a safe path for the snake's head at (5,5) to reach the apple at (4,2). Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's note the initial conditions. The snake's head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (4,2). The current direction is NONE, which means any move is allowed on the first step without worrying about reversing direction.

The Manhattan distance between the head and the apple is |5-4| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a medium distance, but we need to plan carefully to avoid collisions with the body or walls.

Looking at the coordinates, from (5,5) to (4,2), the snake needs to move left once and down three times. That means overall, there should be one more LEFT than RIGHT, and three more DOWN than UP in the moves list.

Since the current direction is NONE, I can choose any initial move without worrying about reversing direction. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.

I need to check if moving directly towards the apple is safe. Moving LEFT from (5,5) would take the head to (4,5). From there, moving DOWN three times would bring it to (4,2), but I have to ensure that each move doesn't collide with the body or go out of bounds.

Wait, the body cells are empty in this case, so no immediate collision worries. However, after eating the apple, the snake's body grows by one segment. So, I need to make sure that when moving towards the apple, especially after the first step, there's enough space and that subsequent moves don't lead into a trap.

Let me outline possible paths:

1. Move LEFT, then DOWN three times.
   - First move: LEFT to (4,5).
   - Next, check if from (4,5), moving DOWN is safe each time without hitting the body or walls.
   - Since there's no body yet, this seems straightforward.

Another option might be to move DOWN first and then adjust direction, but that would require more moves. Considering Manhattan distance, moving directly towards the apple makes sense.

So, planning the moves as LEFT followed by DOWN three times:

Moves: ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"]

But wait, after each move, the snake's body updates. Let me simulate this step by step.

Initial position: head at (5,5), body is empty.
Move 1: LEFT to (4,5). Now, body becomes [(5,5)] and tail is removed if not eating an apple. Since we didn't eat yet, the body was just [ (5,5) ], but after moving, the new head is (4,5), so the body becomes empty? Or wait, when you move, the head moves, then the body follows.

Wait, correction: When the snake moves, the new head is added, and each segment follows. If not eating an apple, the tail is removed. So after first move, the body would be [(5,5)] if moving LEFT. But since it's just the head moving, the body cells are updated as such.

Wait, the initial body is empty because it's given as []. So when the snake moves, the new head is added, and all previous body segments follow. Since there's no body to begin with, after the first move (LEFT), the new head is at (4,5), and the body remains empty except for the head? Or does the body include the previous positions?

Actually, when the snake moves, the head moves, then each body cell follows. So if there are body cells, they shift accordingly. But in this case, since body is [], only the head is moving.

So after first move LEFT to (4,5), the body remains empty because the apple hasn't been eaten yet. Then, moving DOWN three times:

Move 2: DOWN from (4,5) to (4,4). Body is still empty.
Move 3: DOWN to (4,3).
Move 4: DOWN to (4,2).

Upon reaching (4,2), the snake eats the apple. Now, since the apple was eaten, the body grows by one segment, so after this move, the body includes all previous positions plus the new head.

Wait, let me clarify:

After each move where an apple is eaten, the tail doesn't shrink, so the body increases in length. So when we reach (4,2) on the fourth move and eat the apple, the snake's body will have segments at (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). But actually, each move adds a new head position, but without eating, the tail is removed. Since we ate the apple only on the fourth move, so before that, each move would have shrunk the body except when the apple is eaten.

Wait no: The snake's movement is such that with each step:

- New head = current head + direction.
- Then, each body cell follows (moves to the previous position).
- If an apple was eaten in this move, the tail doesn't shrink; otherwise, it does.

So let me track after each move:

Initial state: head at (5,5), body is empty.

Move 1: LEFT to (4,5). Since no apple eaten yet, the body remains empty except for the new head. So body is now [] because tail is removed? Or wait, when you move without eating, the body follows and the tail is removed. But since body was empty, moving won't add any segments beyond the head.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the initial body is empty, after each move, unless an apple is eaten, the body remains as only the current path.

But in this case, since the first three moves don't eat the apple, and the fourth does, let's see:

After move 1 (LEFT): head at (4,5), body is [] because we didn't eat, so tail is removed. So body remains empty.

Move 2: DOWN to (4,4). Again, no apple eaten yet, so body is still empty.

Move 3: DOWN to (4,3). Still no apple eaten; body remains empty.

Move 4: DOWN to (4,2), which is the apple. Now, after eating, the body grows by one segment. So the body will include all previous positions except the head.

Wait, when you eat the apple, the tail doesn't shrink. So before moving, the snake's body was empty; after eating, it adds a new segment at (4,2), but wait, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps each move appends to the body unless an apple is eaten, in which case the body grows by one.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach: simulate each step.

Initial state:
- Head: (5,5)
- Body: []
- Direction: NONE

Move 1: LEFT → new head at (4,5). Since not eating apple, tail is removed (but body was empty), so body remains empty.

State after move 1:
- Head: (4,5)
- Body: []
- Next direction can't be RIGHT because it would reverse from LEFT. But since the initial direction was NONE, direction can now be any except the opposite? Or wait, rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. So if first move is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT.

Wait, no. Rule 3 states that you cannot reverse direction. If current direction is NONE, any move is allowed on the first step. After that, each subsequent move must not be the opposite of the previous direction. So after moving LEFT once, the next move can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again, but not RIGHT.

So for move 2, possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT.

But in our case, we need to go down three times. So from (4,5), moving DOWN is safe.

Move 2: DOWN → new head at (4,4). Not eating apple yet, so body remains empty.

State after move 2:
- Head: (4,4)
- Body: []
- Next direction can't be UP.

Move 3: DOWN again → (4,3). Still no apple eaten.

State after move 3:
- Head: (4,3)
- Body: []
- Next direction can't be UP.

Move 4: DOWN to (4,2), which is the apple. Now, eating the apple, so body grows by one segment. So the new head is at (4,2). The previous head was (4,3), so the body will now include that position because the tail doesn't get removed when an apple is eaten.

So after move 4:
- Head: (4,2)
- Body: [ (4,3) ]
- Because we ate the apple, the tail isn't removed. So the snake's length increased by one.

Now, check if there are any collisions:

The body now includes (4,3). The head is at (4,2), which is adjacent to the body cell below it. Wait, but (4,3) is directly above (4,2). Since the head moves first, when we move DOWN from (4,3) to (4,2), the new head is (4,2), and the previous head (4,3) becomes part of the body.

So after eating, the snake's body is [(4,3)], and head is at (4,2). So no collision because the head is not overlapping with any body segments yet. But in this case, the body only has one segment, which is behind the head, so it's safe.

Now, we need to ensure that after eating, there's at least one legal move left. Because according to rule 4, the snake dies if it can't make a move after eating. So let's check:

From (4,2), possible moves without reversing direction. The last move was DOWN, so next move cannot be UP.

Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

Check each:

- LEFT: (3,2). Is that within grid? Yes.
- RIGHT: (5,2). Also valid.
- DOWN: (4,1). Valid.

So multiple options are available. So it's safe; no immediate collision.

Thus, the moves ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"] seem valid.

But wait, let me check the final position to ensure that LEFTs minus RIGHTs equal 5 - 4 = 1? Wait, initial x was 5, target is 4. So LEFTs should be 1 more than RIGHTs. In this case, one LEFT and zero RIGHTs, which satisfies 1-0=1.

Similarly, for y: from 5 to 2, a decrease of 3. So DOWNs minus UPs should be 3. We have three DOWN moves and zero UPs, so 3-0=3, which is correct.

Therefore, the moves satisfy the final position checks.

But wait another thing: after moving LEFT, then DOWN three times, does the path collide with any walls? Let's see:

From (5,5) → (4,5): x decreases by 1, y remains same. Then from (4,5), move down to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). All these positions are within the grid (0-9 in both x and y).

So no wall collisions.

Another consideration: If the snake's body grows after eating, but since it only has one segment behind, moving further is safe as long as we don't move back into that segment. But after eating, any next moves would have to avoid the new body cell at (4,3). So if I choose to move LEFT from (4,2), the new head would be (3,2), which isn't adjacent to (4,3) because it's one unit left, but the body is at (4,3), which is diagonally up-right. So no collision there.

Alternatively, moving DOWN from (4,2) would go to (4,1), which is also safe as it doesn't collide with the body.

So the path seems safe.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to plan a safe path for the snake's head starting at position (5, 5) to reach the apple located at (4, 2). The solution must avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body while adhering to movement rules.

### Approach
1. **Initial Conditions**: The snake's head is at (5, 5), and the apple is at (4, 2). The current direction is NONE, allowing any initial move.
2. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction immediately. After each move, the body follows, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.
3. **Manhattan Distance**: Calculate the distance to determine the number of moves required. From (5, 5) to (4, 2), we need one LEFT move and three DOWN moves.
4. **Path Planning**: Move directly towards the apple without unnecessary detours. Check each step for potential collisions with walls or body segments.

### Solution Code
```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves LEFT to (4,5), then DOWN three times to safely reach the apple at (4,2) without reversing direction or colliding with walls. Each step ensures no immediate collision and maintains valid movement."
}
```
