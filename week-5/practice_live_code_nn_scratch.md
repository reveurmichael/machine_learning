# Interactive Live Coding Session

During our 90-minute session, we will collaborate using Git and GitHub, in the objective of building a neural network from scratch, a third time.

### Workflow:
1. I will code and then perform a `git commit` and `git push`.
2. You will use `git stash` and `git pull` to sync your code with mine.
3. Run the code and make any necessary modifications.
4. I will continue coding, followed by another `git commit` and `git push`.
5. You will repeat the process: `git stash`, `git pull`, run the code, and modify as needed.

This cycle will continue until the end of the session.
