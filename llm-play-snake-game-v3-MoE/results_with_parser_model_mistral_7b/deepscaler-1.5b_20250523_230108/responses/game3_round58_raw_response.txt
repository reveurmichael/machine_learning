<think>
Okay, so I need to help plan a safe path for the snake's head from (7,4) to eat the apple at (6,6). Let me start by understanding all the given information and the movement rules.

First, the snake's current state: The body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the body cells list includes from behind the head to the tail. So the full snake S is [head, body1, body2, ..., tail]. Here, the given body cells start with the segment immediately behind the head, which would be the first element of the body segments.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The problem says: "The provided Body cells list (in the inputs) excludes the head and goes from BODY1 (nearest the head) to BODYN (the tail)." So in this case, the given body cells are [ (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) ]. Since the snake's head is at (7,4). Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The initial position of the snake is such that the head is at (7,4), and the body cells list starts from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So for example, if the head is at (x,y), then the next segment in the body would be either up, down, left, or right. But perhaps it's better to model the snake as a list where each element represents a body part.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify: The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN]. Each BODYi is adjacent to its predecessor, meaning each consecutive pair in S is one cell apart. Also, the given Body cells are ordered from the segment immediately behind the head (which would be the first element of the body list) to the tail.

So in this case, the snake's body parts are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Wait, but these are positions relative to the grid. Let me see: The head is at (7,4). The Body1 would be behind it, which would be either (7-1,4) = (6,4) or another direction. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the given body cells are the positions from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So if the snake's head is at (7,4), then the first element of the body list would be the position before the head. For example, if moving "DOWN", then the previous cell would be (7-1,4) = (6,4). But perhaps in this case, the given body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], which suggests that from behind the head to tail is moving right or down? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the body list starts with the segment immediately before the head. For example, if current direction is "DOWN", then the previous cell would be one step above, so maybe (7-1,4) = (6,4), but that's not in the given body cells. Hmm, perhaps I need to focus more on the problem.

The goal is to move from head at (7,4) to (6,6). The apple is at (6,6). So the snake needs to reach a position where its head is at (6,6), but wait no—because if the snake's body includes the tail, then perhaps when the head moves to (6,6), the body might have changed.

Wait, perhaps I should model the snake as follows: The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN]. Each BODYi is adjacent to the previous one. So for example, if current direction is "DOWN", then eachBodyi+1 is (bodyXi, y-1). But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of movement.

The snake is currently at position head=(7,4), and the body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Wait, but this seems confusing. Maybe I need to think differently: The given body cells list includes all segments from behind the head to the tail. So if the current direction is "DOWN", then each subsequent body cell is one step down.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the snake as follows:

The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN]. Each segment in S must be adjacent (Manhattan distance 1) to the previous. So for example, if current direction is "DOWN", then each subsequent body cell is one step down.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Let's move forward with the problem.

The snake's head is at (7,4), and the apple is at (6,6). We need to find a path from (7,4) to (6,6), moving through the grid without hitting any body segments except when eating the apple.

Given that the snake can't reverse direction on the first move if it's not "NONE", but in this case, perhaps the current direction isn't given yet. Wait, no: The movement example says that choosing "LEFT" from a certain state would change the head position. But perhaps we need to determine the initial direction.

But maybe I should proceed with planning the path without worrying about the initial direction, as it's part of the problem.

So the snake is currently at (7,4), and the body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Wait, perhaps this indicates that from the head, moving down three times would reach (7-3,4) = (4,4)? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each Bodyi is the next segment in the snake.

But perhaps I should focus on planning the path step by step.

First, let's note the positions:

Head: (7,4)
Apple position: (6,6)
We need to move from (7,4) to (6,6).

The body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Wait, perhaps these are the segments behind the head. So if the current direction is "UP", then each subsequent segment would be above, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the snake as follows: The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN]. Each body part must be adjacent to the previous one.

Given that the head is at (7,4), and the body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], perhaps this indicates that the segments behind the head are moving towards the right or down. For example, if current direction is "DOWN", then each segment would be one step below.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with planning the path from (7,4) to (6,6), considering the body constraints.

The snake must not have any segments overlapping except when moving into the new head position. Also, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn.

So let's plan a possible path:

1. Start at (7,4). The direction is "DOWN" since we need to reach (6,6) which is below and right of (7,4).

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the body segments as well. Let's see: The snake's body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. This suggests that from the head at (7,4), moving down to (6,4) would be part of the body? Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the given body cells are from behind the head to the tail. So if the snake's current direction is "DOWN", then each segment in the body list is one step below the previous.

So for example, if the head is at (7,4), and moving down, then the first body cell would be (6,4) as part of the body. But perhaps that's not directly given.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the snake as follows: The full snake S is [HEAD, BODY1, BODY2, ...]. Each segment in S must be adjacent to the previous one.

Given the head at (7,4), and the body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], perhaps this indicates that from the head, moving right or down. But perhaps it's better to think of each body cell as part of the snake's body.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with planning a path:

The snake starts at (7,4). To reach (6,6), we need to move towards the apple. The Manhattan distance from (7,4) to (6,6) is |7-6| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps. But perhaps considering possible detours.

But let's think about the body constraints:

1. Each segment must be adjacent.
2. When moving into a new head position, it must not collide with any body segments except for when eating the apple.

Given that the snake is currently at (7,4), and the body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], perhaps this indicates that from the head, the previous segment was (8,4) or something else. But maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given body cells are part of the snake's body segments after the head, moving in a certain direction. For example, if current direction is "DOWN", then each subsequent body cell would be below the previous.

So starting at (7,4), moving down to (6,4) as BODY1, then to (5,4) as BODY2, etc. But perhaps this isn't directly useful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on planning a path from (7,4) to (6,6) without considering the body for now, and then adjust based on constraints.

So let's plan a possible path:

1. Start at (7,4).
2. Move DOWN to (6,4). But wait, that might be part of the body.
Alternatively, perhaps move RIGHT to (7,5), but then check if it's allowed.

But perhaps I need to model this as each step moving towards the apple, considering possible obstacles and constraints.

Let me outline a possible path:

- Step 1: Move DOWN from (7,4) to (6,4). But wait, perhaps that's not correct because we might want to move in such a way that the body doesn't block.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as follows:

We need to reach (6,6) from (7,4), moving through cells without crossing any body segments except when eating the apple.

Given that the snake is currently at (7,4), and the body includes [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], perhaps this indicates that these are part of the snake's body after the head. So perhaps each segment in S is the next part of the snake.

So if current direction is "DOWN", then from (7,4) moving down would be (6,4), but perhaps that's not directly given.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the path as follows:

We start at (7,4). We need to move towards (6,6).

Possible steps:

1. Move DOWN to (6,4).
2. Then, from (6,4), we can try moving RIGHT to (6,5) or UP.

But perhaps let's see the body constraints.

Given that the snake is currently at (7,4), and the body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], perhaps these represent segments behind the head. So perhaps when the current direction is "DOWN", then each subsequent segment would be one step below.

So if current direction is "DOWN", then from (7,4) moving down to (6,4) as the first body cell, but perhaps that's not part of the given body cells.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should proceed with planning a path without considering the initial direction, since it might be determined by constraints during movement.

So let's plan a possible path:

1. Start at (7,4).
2. Move DOWN to (6,4). But wait, perhaps this is part of the body.
Alternatively, maybe move RIGHT to (7,5) as the first step towards the apple.

But perhaps we need to consider that moving into a new segment must not be adjacent to any body segments except when eating the apple.

So let's think about each possible move:

From (7,4), possible moves are:

- DOWN to (6,4)
- RIGHT to (7,5)

Let's check these options.

Option 1: Move DOWN to (6,4). Now, we need to ensure that this position is not part of the body. The current body cells include [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], which suggests perhaps moving down from (7,4) would result in a segment at (6,4), but since it's not given as a body cell, perhaps it's allowed.

But wait, perhaps the initial direction affects this. For example, if current direction is "DOWN", then each subsequent body cell must be below.

In that case, from (7,4) moving DOWN would result in (6,4), which may or may not be part of the body.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should proceed with planning a path regardless of initial direction.

Let's think about possible steps:

We need to move towards (6,6). Let's plan each step, considering that after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn.

So let's consider moving from (7,4) down and right as much as needed.

But perhaps a better approach is to model this as a pathfinding problem with constraints.

Given that:

- The snake starts at (7,4).
- It has body segments [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)].
- We need to reach (6,6).

Let's think about each step:

1. From (7,4), possible moves are down or right.

If we move DOWN to (6,4):

But perhaps this position is part of the body? The given body cells include [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], which suggests that moving from head at (7,4) may result in a segment at (8,4) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step:

Step 1: From (7,4), move DOWN to (6,4). Now, check if this position is allowed. Since the snake hasn't moved yet, perhaps moving down here would not interfere with any body segments except when eating the apple.

But since we need to reach (6,6), let's see how many steps that takes:

From (7,4) to (6,6): distance is 1 (down) + 2 (right) = 3 steps. But perhaps considering possible detours.

Alternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT first would be better.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting stuck and should proceed with planning the path as follows:

We need to reach (6,6). Let's plan a path that moves right and down step by step.

Possible path:

(7,4) → (7,5) → (7,6) → ... Wait no, because we might be moving beyond the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each move must not result in overlapping with body segments except when eating the apple.

Given that, let's plan a possible path:

1. Move DOWN from (7,4) to (6,4). Now, this position is allowed as long as moving into it doesn't collide with any body segment, which isn't given yet.

But perhaps after moving to (6,4), the next step could be RIGHT to (6,5).

Then, perhaps move DOWN again to (5,5). Wait, but let's see:

At each step, we need to ensure that the new position is either part of the snake or leads towards the apple without overlapping.

But perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Let me try another way: since the problem requires moving from (7,4) to (6,6), and considering that after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn.

Let's think about possible paths:

Option 1:

Move DOWN three times to reach (4,4). But perhaps this is too far and may not lead towards the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path involves moving RIGHT first.

From (7,4), move RIGHT to (7,5).

Then, from (7,5), move RIGHT to (7,6). Then DOWN to (6,6). But wait, let's check if this is possible.

But perhaps the body segments need to be considered. From (7,4) moving down would result in a segment at (6,4), but perhaps that's not part of the given body cells.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after each move, we must ensure that the new position doesn't conflict with any existing body segments except when eating the apple.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to outline possible steps and see which path leads towards (6,6) without conflicting with the constraints.

Let me attempt a step-by-step plan:

1. Start at (7,4).
2. Move DOWN to (6,4). Now position is (6,4). Check if this is allowed. Since moving from (7,4), perhaps this is acceptable.
3. From (6,4), move RIGHT to (6,5). This would be the next step towards the apple at (6,6).
4. At (6,5), check if any body segments are present that could cause collision. The given body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], so perhaps moving into (6,5) is allowed as it's part of the snake.
5. Now at (6,5), move RIGHT to (6,6). This would reach the apple position.

But wait, let's check if this path is valid:

- After step 2: (6,4)
- Step 3: (6,5) → not in body cells yet
- Step 4: (6,5) → part of body?
Wait no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial direction is DOWN, so from (7,4), moving down to (6,4). Then moving right to (6,5), then right again to (6,6).

But let's check if this path is allowed:

- At each step, ensure that the new position doesn't conflict with any existing body segments.

Given that the initial direction is DOWN, perhaps the snake moves as follows:

1. Start at (7,4).
2. Move DOWN → (6,4). Now, since we're moving into a new segment, check if this causes any collision with existing body cells.
   - The given body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. So perhaps (6,4) is not part of the body. Thus, it's allowed.

3. Now at (6,4). Next move: RIGHT to (6,5).
   - Check if moving into (6,5) causes collision.
     - The existing body cells are [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. So the segment (6,5) is part of the snake. Thus, moving into (6,5) would be allowed only if it's not already in the path.

Wait no: perhaps each move must land on a cell that is either free or allows the next step without collision.

This is getting complicated, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, since we're starting at (7,4), and need to reach (6,6), let's calculate how many steps are needed:

From (7,4) → (6,6): this would require moving left once and up twice? No, because that would take us away from the apple. Alternatively, perhaps moving right twice and down twice.

But perhaps considering movement constraints due to the body segments:

Given that the initial position is at (7,4), and the body includes [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], perhaps this indicates that these are part of the snake's body after the head. So when moving from (7,4) down, perhaps we'll reach (6,4), then move right to (6,5).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with code-like logic to outline possible paths.

But since I'm doing this manually, let me try:

Possible path:

1. Move DOWN from (7,4) → (6,4).
2. From (6,4), move RIGHT → (6,5).
3. Now at (6,5). Next step could be RIGHT to (6,6).

But I need to ensure that moving into (6,5) doesn't cause any collision.

The given body cells include [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], so perhaps when moving from (6,4) → (6,5), this position is allowed as long as it's not already part of the snake or blocked by existing segments.

But perhaps after moving to (6,5), we need to move down again to reach the apple at (6,6).

Thus, the path would be:

(7,4) → (6,4) → (6,5) → (6,6).

Now, let's check if this is valid.

At each step:

1. From (7,4) to (6,4): allowed.
2. From (6,4) to (6,5): allowed because it's not in the body cells yet and doesn't cause any collision.
3. From (6,5) to (6,6): also allowed.

Now, after reaching (6,6), we need to ensure that there is at least one legal move next turn.

After eating the apple at (6,6), perhaps the snake can move in other directions or continue moving towards the apple.

But since our goal is to reach (6,6) from (7,4), let's see if this path works.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Move DOWN to (6,4).
2. Move RIGHT to (6,5).
3. Move RIGHT to (6,6).

This would be three moves: DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT.

But perhaps considering that after moving RIGHT from (7,4) → (6,4), then another move is needed to reach the apple.

Alternatively, maybe a better path involves moving right first:

1. From (7,4) → (7,5).
   - Check if this position is allowed.
     - The body cells include [(7,5)], so perhaps moving into (7,5) is not allowed as it's part of the snake's body.

Thus, this path would be invalid.

Hence, perhaps the initial move must be DOWN to (6,4), then RIGHT to (6,5), and then RIGHT again to (6,6).

Therefore, the sequence of moves is:

1. DOWN → from (7,4) to (6,4).
2. RIGHT → from (6,4) to (6,5).
3. RIGHT → from (6,5) to (6,6).

This results in reaching the apple position with three steps.

Thus, the final answer would be:

The sequence of moves is DOWN then RIGHT twice.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to guide a snake starting at position (7,4) towards the apple located at (6,6). The snake's body segments are given as [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)], which suggests that these positions are part of its body after the head. 

The optimal path involves moving down first to avoid collision with existing body segments, then proceeding right twice to reach the apple.

**Answer:**

You need to move DOWN from (7,4) to (6,4), then RIGHT to (6,5), and finally RIGHT again to (6,6). This sequence will lead you towards the apple at (6,6).

The path is:

1. Move DOWN.
2. Move RIGHT.
3. Move RIGHT.

Thus, the final answer is represented by these moves.

$\boxed{(7,4) \rightarrow (6,4) \rightarrow (6,5) \rightarrow (6,6)}$
