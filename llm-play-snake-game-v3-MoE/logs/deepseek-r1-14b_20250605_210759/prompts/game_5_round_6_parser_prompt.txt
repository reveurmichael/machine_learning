========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake eat the apple at (7,6) without dying. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.

The snake's head is at (6,6), and it's currently moving UP. The body cells are [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. So, the snake is a vertical line extending from (6,6) down to (6,2). The apple is just one cell to the right of the head at (7,6).

First, I need to consider the direction rules. Since the current direction is UP, the next move can't be DOWN because that would reverse direction. So the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or staying in UP.

Looking at the apple's position, it's directly to the right of the head. So moving RIGHT seems like a straightforward path. Let me check if there are any obstacles in that path.

If I move RIGHT from (6,6), the new head would be at (7,6). Now, I need to ensure that this new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail when it moves.

Looking at the body cells: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]. None of these are at (7,6), so moving RIGHT is safe in terms of collision. Also, since this move would take the head to the apple's position, the snake will grow by one segment, meaning the tail won't be removed this turn.

So after moving RIGHT, the body will add the old head (6,6) at the front, making the new body list [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. Since we ate the apple, the tail doesn't move, so the length increases by one. Now the snake's body is longer, but the new head is safely at (7,6) with no collision.

I also need to ensure that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move next turn. Right now, the new head is at (7,6). The possible directions would be UP or DOWN because we just moved RIGHT. Wait, but what was the previous direction? Oh right, the current direction is UP, so when moving RIGHT, that changes the direction to RIGHT for the next move.

Wait no—the movement direction changes based on the chosen move. So after moving RIGHT, the new direction will be RIGHT. But in this case, since the apple is eaten, the next move needs to ensure we don't get stuck. However, after eating, the snake's body has grown, so I need to check if any adjacent cells are blocked.

But in this specific case, since the apple was just one cell away, moving RIGHT directly gets us there without any issues. There's no immediate collision, and the path is clear.

I think moving RIGHT is the best choice here because it's direct and avoids any potential obstacles. The snake can grow by eating the apple, and as long as we don't reverse direction immediately, which isn't a concern here since the next move would be after eating, but that's handled by the movement rules.

{"moves": ["RIGHT"], "reasoning": "The direct path to the apple at (7,6) is clear, with no body segments in the way. Moving RIGHT from (6,6) safely reaches the apple without collision."}

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (7, 6). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
