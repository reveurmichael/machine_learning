{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,0) with a body trailing upward. To reach the apple at (9,0), the shortest safe path is moving right repeatedly. Each right move avoids collisions with the body (which trails behind the head) and stays within grid bounds. After 9 right moves, the head reaches the apple, and the snake can grow while maintaining a legal next move (e.g., up)."
