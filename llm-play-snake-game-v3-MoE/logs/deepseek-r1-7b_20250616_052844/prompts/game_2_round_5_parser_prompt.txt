========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (1,2) to (3,2) without dying. Let's start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (1,2), and it's moving DOWN. The apple is right there at (3,2). Wait, no, the apple is actually at (3,2)? But if the head is at (1,2) and direction is DOWN, then moving further down would take it to (1,1). That doesn't help.

Wait a minute, maybe I need to check the movement rules again. The snake's head moves based on its current direction. So right now, direction is DOWN, so next move without eating apple should be straight DOWN from (1,2) to (1,1).

But before moving, we have to check for collisions. Since the body cells are empty in this initial state because it's given as an empty list, there shouldn't be any collision.

Wait no, the snake can only move if it doesn't hit itself. The current head is at (1,2), and since the body is empty except for the head, moving DOWN to (1,1) should be safe.

So first move: DOWN from (1,2) to (1,1). But wait, that's not towards the apple at (3,2). Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait no, maybe the snake can't just go straight if it's blocked by its own body in the future after moving. But since it's empty right now, moving DOWN is safe.

But then how do we get to (3,2)? Because from (1,2), moving RIGHT twice will reach (3,2). So maybe first move RIGHT.

Wait, but direction can't reverse on the first move because current direction is DOWN. Oh wait, no—if it's the first move, there's no previous direction except NONE. Wait, initial direction is "DOWN", so after the first move, next moves cannot be "UP".

But let me think: to get from (1,2) to (3,2), which requires moving RIGHT twice. So perhaps changing direction to RIGHT.

So plan:

Move Right once: new_head = (2,2). Check if it's empty—yes. Then move again right to (3,2).

But wait, when you change direction mid-way, do you have to consider that? Or can you just keep moving in the same direction?

Wait no, because each movement step must be one direction at a time.

So first, from (1,2), current direction is DOWN. So next move without eating apple would be DOWN to (1,1). But perhaps if we choose RIGHT instead, but since the current direction is DOWN, can't reverse immediately? Or wait, no—the movement rules say you cannot reverse on the first move.

Wait, initial direction is "DOWN". Since it's the first move after starting, can I change direction to RIGHT or UP?

But according to the movement update rules:

Each move step involves choosing a new direction. Then if current direction was 'UP', next move can't be 'DOWN' and vice versa. But initially, since the current direction is 'DOWN', when making the first move after starting, you cannot reverse it.

Wait no—the rule says that "you may not choose to reverse"—so for example, if current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN next; same for LEFT and RIGHT. So initial state: direction is DOWN—next move can't be UP.

So from (1,2), since the first move after starting cannot reverse (i.e., go back to NONE?), or wait no—NONE is when it hasn't moved yet. After moving down once, the next move can choose other directions except UP.

Wait, let's clarify: according to the movement rules:

You are given current direction as "DOWN". So for the first move after starting, you cannot choose a direction that would reverse this. But since your initial state is moving DOWN, and NONE isn't applicable unless it hasn't moved yet, which only happens once at the start.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The movement rules say: "Cannot reverse": current direction is DOWN—so next move can be RIGHT, LEFT, or nothing (NONE). Wait no—if you choose "UP" after being "DOWN", that's a reversal. So first move cannot be UP because it reverses from the initial state.

But wait, in this scenario, the snake hasn't moved yet; current direction is DOWN—so movement for next step can only be RIGHT or LEFT or NONE (but NONE would mean not moving). However, since we need to reach (3,2), which is two cells to the right, perhaps changing direction mid-way.

But how?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The initial state has head at (1,2) and direction DOWN. So first move can't be UP. It must choose RIGHT or LEFT or NONE? But moving NONE doesn't make sense if we're trying to get towards the apple.

So first step: Right. Move from (1,2) to (2,2). Check collision—no body except head, so safe. Then next step, since previous direction was RIGHT, current direction can be anything except LEFT? No—the rule says you cannot reverse directions on subsequent moves. Wait:

Rule 2: Cannot reverse—so if the current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So from initial position (1,2), first move must change to a non-reversing direction. So after moving RIGHT once, next move can be any except LEFT? Or since previous was RIGHT, next cannot be LEFT?

Wait no: the rule says you cannot reverse on subsequent moves—so if current direction is RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT.

Therefore, from (1,2), first move must be to a non-reversing direction. So after moving Right once, the next step can't go Left.

So let's plan:

First move: Right → new head at (2,2). Check no collision—safe.
Second move: since previous was RIGHT, can't choose LEFT or maybe other directions? No—the rule says you cannot reverse on subsequent moves. So from RIGHT, you can't choose LEFT next; but UP and DOWN are allowed.

So to get towards the apple at (3,2), which is two cells right from current position after first move, I need another Right step. But after first Right, previous direction was RIGHT, so cannot reverse.

Wait—that would require three steps: initial direction DOWN—first move can't be UP or something else? Wait no—the initial state has head at (1,2) and direction DOWN; the movement rules say you can choose any direction except when it's a reversal. So in this case, from direction DOWN, first move cannot reverse to UP.

But we want to go RIGHT twice. Since after moving Right once, previous was RIGHT—so next step cannot be LEFT. But we need another Right step to reach (3,2).

Wait—that would require changing direction again. Let's see:

After moving Right once, position is (2,2), and last direction was RIGHT. So for the second move, can't choose LEFT.

But to get from (2,2) to (3,2), we need another Right. But since previous step was RIGHT, now you cannot reverse—so you have to make a different non-reversing move? Or is it allowed?

Wait no—the rule says that after moving in one direction, the next move can't be its opposite. So from RIGHT, next can't be LEFT; but UP or DOWN are allowed.

So if I'm at (2,2) with previous direction RIGHT, my options for next move are: UP, DOWN, or NONE? But moving none would not help in reaching apple.

Wait, but the snake needs to move. So from position (2,2), direction can't be LEFT—so choose another non-reversing direction such as RIGHT again? Or maybe change to something else like UP?

But we need to get towards (3,2). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving Right once, then go DOWN or UP and then back to Right. But that complicates the path.

Wait, but in this scenario, since the apple is at (3,2), which is two steps right from the initial head position—so if I can only move RIGHT twice without being forced to change direction.

But after first move RIGHT, previous was RIGHT; next step cannot be LEFT. So need another Right? But that would require changing direction again, but according to rules, you can't reverse on subsequent moves.

Wait no—the rule says: "Cannot reverse"—i.e., if current direction is RIGHT, you can't choose LEFT next. But UP and DOWN are allowed.

So in this case, from (2,2), with previous direction RIGHT, I need to move again right without reversing. So:

Move 1: Right → (2,2)
Move 2: Right → (3,2). But according to rules, after moving Right once, cannot choose LEFT next; but we can still choose another RIGHT step.

Wait no—if the previous direction was RIGHT, you can't reverse it by choosing LEFT again. So in this case, from (2,2), with last direction RIGHT, next move can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again without violating the reversal rule because you're not changing to its opposite.

So perhaps:

Move 1: Right → (2,2)
Move 2: Right → (3,2)

Which would get us directly to apple's position. But is that allowed?

Wait let me think again—rule says "Cannot reverse"—so if current direction is RIGHT, you can't choose LEFT next. Choosing another RIGHT isn't a reversal; it's same as before.

So yes, moving Right twice is possible without violating the rule.

Therefore:

First move: Right → (2,2)
Second move: Right → (3,2)

This should be allowed because after each step, we're not choosing LEFT when previous was RIGHT. So no reversal occurs.

But wait—after the first Right, direction is RIGHT. Then next move can't be LEFT but can be RIGHT again or any other non-reversing directions like UP or DOWN—but in this case, moving another RIGHT would get us closer to apple.

So plan:

Move 1: Right → (2,2)
Move 2: Right → (3,2)

This should work because after the first move, we haven't reversed; just continued same direction. So no reversal occurs between steps—so it's allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP or DOWN would complicate things more than needed.

So to summarize:

From (1,2) with initial direction DOWN:

- First move cannot be UP but can choose RIGHT or LEFT or NONE.
To reach (3,2), best path is two Rights. Since first Right is allowed and second Right isn't a reversal from the first, it's possible.

Therefore, the answer would be moving Right twice.

But wait—another thought: in step 1, after moving Right to (2,2), then next move can choose RIGHT again because previous was RIGHT; not a reversal. So yes, allowed.
</think>

The snake moves right twice from (1,2) without reversing direction.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial State:** Snake's head is at (1,2), moving DOWN. Body cells are empty except for the head.

2. **First Move:** Choose RIGHT to move towards increasing x-direction.
   - New position becomes (2,2). No collision with body since it's empty.
   
3. **Second Move:** Previous direction was RIGHT; choose RIGHT again without reversing.
   - New position is (3,2), which matches the apple's location.

**Answer:**
The snake should move right twice to reach the apple at (3,2).

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (1, 2) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (3, 2). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
