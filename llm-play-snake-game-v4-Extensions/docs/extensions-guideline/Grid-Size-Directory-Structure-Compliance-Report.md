# Grid-Size Directory Structure Compliance Report

VITAL: THIS ONE IS VERY IMPORTANT. It's a single-source-of-truth documentation – applies to **all** extensions.

IMPORTANT FILE THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER IGNORE.


## Overview

TODO: Things might have changed. It's in ongoing discussion. Make we have made a decison on this logs folder and file naming conventions. Maybe, or maybe not. You have to double check.


This report documents the comprehensive audit and fixes applied to ensure **all** extensions follow the mandatory grid-size directory structure rule:

- **DATASETS**: `logs/extensions/datasets/grid-size-N/...`
- **MODELS**: `logs/extensions/models/grid-size-N/...`

Where `N` is the grid size used during training/generation.

## Why This Rule Matters

### Design Principle
Models trained on different grid sizes have fundamentally different spatial complexity and should **never** be mixed. This structure enforces:

1. **Clean Separation**: No accidental contamination between grid sizes
2. **Discoverability**: Easy lookup by grid size
3. **Scalability**: New grid sizes integrate seamlessly
4. **Experimental Clarity**: Clear organization for research

#### Changes Made:

TODO: Things might have changed. It's in ongoing discussion. Make we have made a decison on this logs folder and file naming conventions. Maybe, or maybe not. You have to double check.

- Updated all examples to use dynamic grid-size paths
- Added explicit model directory structure documentation
- Emphasized grid-size aware dataset generation

## Compliance Infrastructure

### 1. Validation Script

TODO: Things might have changed. It's in ongoing discussion. Make we have made a decison on this logs folder and file naming conventions. Maybe, or maybe not. You have to double check.


Created `scripts/validate_grid_size_compliance.py` for ongoing compliance monitoring:

```bash
python scripts/validate_grid_size_compliance.py
```

**Features:**
- Detects hardcoded grid-size paths
- Validates training script compliance
- Checks directory structure
- Provides actionable fix recommendations

### 2. Common Utilities (Already Existed)

TODO: Things might have changed. It's in ongoing discussion. Make we have made a decison on this logs folder and file naming conventions. Maybe, or maybe not. You have to double check.


#### DatasetDirectoryManager
- `get_dataset_path()` - Grid-size aware dataset paths
- `get_dataset_dir()` - Grid-size specific directories
- `validate_dataset_path()` - Path compliance validation

#### Model Utils
- `get_model_directory()` - Grid-size aware model paths
- `save_model_standardized()` - Compliant model saving
- Framework-agnostic model storage

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Spatial Complexity Separation**
- No mixing of 8×8 and 20×20 training data
- Models trained on specific spatial complexity
- Clear performance comparison across scales

### 2. **Experimental Organization**
- Easy identification of model applicability
- Clean research dataset management
- Reproducible experiments

### 3. **Future-Proof Architecture**
- Zero code changes needed for new grid sizes
- Automatic directory structure creation
- Standardized model metadata

### 4. **Educational Value**
- Clear demonstration of ML engineering best practices
- Single-source-of-truth principle enforcement
- Design pattern implementation (Factory, Facade, etc.)

## Ongoing Maintenance

### 1. Pre-commit Validation
Consider adding to CI/CD:
```bash
python scripts/validate_grid_size_compliance.py
```

### 2. New Extension Guidelines
All new extensions **must**:
- Use `DatasetDirectoryManager` for dataset paths
- Use `save_model_standardized()` for model saving
- Include grid-size as a configurable parameter
- Follow the established directory conventions

### 3. Documentation Standards
- All tutorials must use dynamic grid-size examples
- No hardcoded grid-size paths in documentation
- Emphasize grid-size awareness in design explanations

## Conclusion

✅ **Full compliance achieved** across all extensions!

The grid-size directory structure rule is now comprehensively enforced, providing:
- **Clean architecture** with proper separation of concerns
- **Scalable design** ready for any grid size
- **Educational value** demonstrating ML engineering best practices
- **Research utility** with organized experimental structure

All extensions (heuristics, supervised, reinforcement, LLM fine-tuning, distillation) now follow this critical organizational principle, ensuring the codebase remains maintainable and scientifically sound as it scales to new grid sizes and experimental configurations.
