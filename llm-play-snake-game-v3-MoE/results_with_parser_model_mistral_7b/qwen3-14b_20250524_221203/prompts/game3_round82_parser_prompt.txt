You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. The head is at (2,2), and the apple is at (2,1). The current direction is DOWN. The body is a long line from (2,3) up to (6,8). Wait, the body cells are [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)]. So the snake is going down along the x=2 column, then moving right along y=8. 

The head is at (2,2), and the apple is directly below it at (2,1). But moving DOWN from (2,2) would take the head to (2,1), which is the apple's position. However, I need to check if that's a valid move. Let's think about the collision checks. 

When moving DOWN, the new head is (2,1). Now, the body segments are from (2,3) up. The tail is at (6,8). The new head (2,1) is not part of the body except maybe the tail's current cell. Wait, the tail's current cell is (6,8), so (2,1) is not that. Therefore, moving DOWN directly to the apple would be valid. But wait, the movement update rule says that when moving into the apple, the body grows. So, after moving, the body would have the old head inserted at the front, and the tail isn't removed. But in this case, the head is moving into the apple. So, the new head is (2,1), and the body would be updated by adding the old head (2,2) to the front of the body list, and since we ate the apple, the tail isn't removed. 

But let me check if moving DOWN is allowed. The current direction is DOWN, so the next move can't be UP (reverse). But moving DOWN again is allowed. Wait, the current direction is DOWN. The movement rules state that you can't reverse direction. So if the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. However, the first move here is moving DOWN, which is the same direction as current. That's allowed. 

So moving DOWN directly would take the head to the apple. But wait, the body is in the way. Let me check the body positions. The body cells are [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)]. So the body is at (2,3) and up. The new head would be (2,1). That position is not occupied by any body segment. The apple is at (2,1), so that's the target. 

But wait, when moving into the apple, the snake grows. So the body would be updated by inserting the old head (2,2) into the front of the body list, and not removing the tail. So the body becomes [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), ... (6,8)]. Then the head is now at (2,1). 

But after eating the apple, the next move must have at least one legal move. Let's think: after eating, the snake's body is longer. The head is at (2,1), and the body is [(2,2), (2,3), ...]. The next move can't be UP (since the current direction is DOWN, but after moving, the direction is still DOWN? Wait, the direction changes based on the movement. Wait, the direction is determined by the move chosen. So if the first move is DOWN, the new direction is still DOWN. Then, after eating the apple, the next move would need to be something that doesn't cause a collision. 

But in this case, after moving to (2,1) and eating the apple, the body is longer. The next move would need to be a direction that doesn't cause the head to collide with the body. Let's imagine the next move. Suppose the snake is now at (2,1), and the body is [(2,2), (2,3), ..., (6,8)]. The next possible moves are DOWN (but that would take the head to (2,0), which is within bounds. However, the body is at (2,2) and up. So (2,0) is not part of the body. So that's a valid move. Alternatively, moving LEFT or RIGHT. 

But the problem is, the first move is to move DOWN into the apple. That seems possible. But why isn't that the answer? Let me check again. 

Wait, the head is at (2,2), and the apple is at (2,1). Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,1), which is the apple. But the body is in the way. Let me check if the new head (2,1) is in the body. The body cells are [(2,3), ...], so (2,1) is not in the body. Therefore, that move is valid. 

So the answer would be to move DOWN once. But why is that not the case? Let me think again. Wait, the current direction is DOWN. So moving DOWN again is allowed. The movement is valid. The head moves to (2,1), which is the apple. So the moves would be ["DOWN"], and the reasoning is that moving directly down to the apple is possible without collision. 

But why isn't that the case? Let me check the collision conditions again. The movement rule says that if the new head is outside the grid, or if it coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move. 

In this case, the new head is (2,1), which is not part of the body. The body is at (2,3) and up. The tail is at (6,8). So (2,1) is not in the body. Therefore, the move is valid. So the answer should be ["DOWN"], right? 

But wait, the body cells list is given as [(2,3), (2,4), ... (6,8)], which are the body segments. So the head is at (2,2), and the body is (2,3) and beyond. So the head is at (2,2), and the next body segment is (2,3). Therefore, the snake is moving down from (2,2) to (2,3) etc. Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is [(2,3), (2,4), ...], which are the segments behind the head. So the head is at (2,2), then the next body segment is (2,3), then (2,4), etc. So the snake is moving in the direction of DOWN. Because the head is at (2,2), and the body is above it. So the snake is moving down, but the body is going up? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the snake's body is a list from the segment immediately behind the head to the tail. So the head is at (2,2), then the first body segment is (2,3), which is directly behind the head. That would imply that the snake is moving in the direction of DOWN, because each body segment is one step behind. So the head is at (2,2), and the body is (2,3), (2,4), etc. So the snake is moving down. Because the head is moving down, and the body follows. 

So if the head is moving down, then the body is following. Therefore, the snake is moving down. So the head is at (2,2), and the body is above it. So moving down again would take the head to (2,1), which is the apple. That's allowed. 

But why would there be any problem? Because after eating the apple, the snake's body grows. So the new head is at (2,1), and the body becomes [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), ... (6,8) ]. Now, the next move. Let's say the direction is still DOWN. Then the new head would be (2,0). Is that valid? The body is at (2,2), (2,3), etc. So (2,0) is not part of the body. Therefore, that's valid. So the move is safe. 

Therefore, the answer should be ["DOWN"], with the reasoning that the apple is directly below the head, and moving down immediately reaches it without collision. 

But why is the body not blocking? Because the body is at (2,3) and up, and the apple is at (2,1), which is not part of the body. So the move is valid. 

So the JSON should be {"moves": ["DOWN"], "reasoning": "The apple is directly below the head at (2,1), so moving down immediately reaches it without collision."}
</think>

{
"moves": ["DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly below the head at (2,1), so moving down immediately reaches it without collision."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 2) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)], to eat the apple at (2, 1).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
