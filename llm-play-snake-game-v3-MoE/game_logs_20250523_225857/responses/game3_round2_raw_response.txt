========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without dying. Let's start by analyzing the current state.

The head is at (6,5), and the body cells are [(5,5)]. The apple is at (6,7). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake was moving towards increasing x-values. Since it's a 10x10 grid, the coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right.

First, I should visualize this on a grid. The head is at (6,5), body segment at (5,5), and the apple is two units above the head in y-coordinate but same x-coordinate. So, it's directly north from the head.

Since the snake is currently facing RIGHT, it can't reverse direction immediately. That means the next move can't be LEFT. The available directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

If I choose UP, the new head will be at (6,6). Then, since the apple is at (6,7), which is another step up, but I have to check if that's possible without colliding with the body.

Wait, after moving UP, the snake's body needs to shift. The old head becomes part of the body. So, the new body would be [(6,5) at front, (5,5)] and then add new head (6,6). But then, when I move UP again, it would go to (6,7), which is the apple.

But before that, I need to ensure there are no collisions. The current body is only one segment at (5,5), so moving to (6,6) should be safe. Then, in the next step, moving to (6,7) would eat the apple, allowing the snake to grow by one segment.

Wait, but after eating the apple, I can't move into any body segments except the tail's current position. So, if I'm at (6,7), and the body is [(6,5), (5,5)], then moving again would require checking for collisions.

Alternatively, maybe going RIGHT first is better. Let me think.

If I choose RIGHT from (6,5), the head moves to (7,5). Then, check if that's safe. There's no body segment there because the current body is at (5,5). So, it's a valid move. Now, the body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)] and the new head is (7,5).

From here, what can I do? Since the direction was RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT again immediately. I could go UP or DOWN.

If I go UP from (7,5) to (7,6). Then, check if that's safe. The body will shift: old head (7,5) becomes part of the body. So the new body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Then, moving up again would take me to (7,7), which is one step away from the apple at (6,7). Hmm, that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, maybe after going RIGHT to (7,5), I can go DOWN. But that might take me further away from the apple.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to move UP first from (6,5) to (6,6), then again to (6,7). Let's check if this works.

First move: UP to (6,6). The new body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)] and the head is at (6,6). Next move: UP again to (6,7). Since that's the apple, I grow by one segment. Now, the body becomes [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)], but wait, no, because after eating the apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body remains as it is except for adding the new head.

Wait, actually, when the snake eats the apple, the tail stays, so the body length increases by one. So, in this case, after moving to (6,7), the body would be [(6,5) at front, (6,6), (5,5)]. But wait, no, because when you eat the apple, you add the new head and keep all the other segments.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

- The initial state: head is (6,5), body is [(5,5)].
- Move UP to (6,6). Now, body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)], and head is at (6,6).
- Next move: UP again to (6,7). This is the apple. So, we add the new head to the front and grow by one segment. The body after this move would be [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. But wait, no—the tail doesn't move when eating, so the body should just have the new head added.

Wait, in the movement rules: when you eat the apple, you do not remove the tail. So the body length increases by one. So, after moving to (6,7), the body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)] and then adds (6,6) as the new head? Or does it insert the old head at the front?

Wait, in step 3a: Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list. So after moving to (6,7), the body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)] and then we add the old head, which was (6,5) before moving to (6,6). Wait, no—before the move to (6,7), the head was at (6,6). So when you eat the apple, you insert the old head (6,6) at the front of the body. Then, since it's an apple, the tail doesn't move.

Wait, let me re-express this step by step:

1. Head is at (6,5), body is [(5,5)].
2. Move UP to (6,6). Check if safe: yes. Body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)], head is now (6,6).
3. Next move: UP again to (6,7). This is the apple. So:
   a. Insert old head (6,6) at front of body ⇒ body becomes [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)].
   b. Since new_head is apple, grow: do not remove tail. So body remains as [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. Wait, no—the body after inserting would be [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)], and since it's an apple, we don't remove the tail. So the new body is [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)] with the tail still at (5,5).

But wait, in this case, the head is now at (6,7), and the body has three segments: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). So, each segment is adjacent to the next.

Wait, but from (6,5) to (6,6), that's correct. From (6,6) to (6,7), that's also correct. But then, the tail is at (5,5), which is two steps away from the head. That might cause a problem in future moves.

Wait, no—the snake's body must be continuous with each segment adjacent to the next. So, (6,7) head, followed by (6,6), (6,5), and (5,5). Each consecutive pair differs by exactly 1 in x or y. Yes, that works.

But after eating the apple, I need to make sure there's at least one legal move next turn. So from (6,7), what can I do? The direction was UP. Next moves can't be DOWN unless it's a reversal. Wait, no—the previous direction was UP, so the next move can't be DOWN.

Wait, the movement rules say: Cannot reverse. If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So after moving UP twice to reach (6,7), the last direction was UP, so the next move can't be DOWN.

So from (6,7), possible directions are UP or RIGHT. But if I go UP again, it would be (6,8), which is outside the grid. So that's invalid. If I choose RIGHT, then new head is (7,7). Is that safe?

Wait, but after eating the apple, moving right would require checking for collisions. The body is [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. Moving to (7,7) would be adjacent, and not collide with any body parts. So that's a valid move.

But wait, from (6,7), if I choose RIGHT to (7,7), the new head is there. Then, check for collisions: it's within bounds and not in the body except possibly the tail. The body after this move would be [(7,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. Each consecutive pair is adjacent. So that works.

Alternatively, from (6,7), I could also choose UP again, but that's out of bounds, so it's invalid. Or RIGHT as discussed.

So, in this case, after eating the apple, there are still valid moves available, so it's safe.

Alternatively, what if I went RIGHT first? Let me see:

1. Move RIGHT to (7,5). Check: no collision. Body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)], head at (7,5).
2. Next move options: UP or DOWN since previous direction was RIGHT.
   - If I choose UP to (7,6): body becomes [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Then next move could be UP again to (7,7), which is one step away from apple at (6,7). Not directly helpful.
   - Alternatively, maybe choose DOWN from (7,5) to (7,4): that's moving away.

So, it seems taking the path of moving UP twice is more direct towards the apple.

Therefore, the optimal path is:

- Move UP from (6,5) to (6,6).
- Then move UP again to (6,7), eating the apple and growing.
- Finally, move RIGHT to (7,7).

But wait, after eating the apple, can I move RIGHT without any issue? Let me confirm:

After moving to (6,7), body is [(6,5), (5,5)] with head at (6,6) and then added as new head. Wait no—the insertion of the old head happens before considering growth.

Wait, when you move to (6,7), which is the apple:

- Insert old head (6,6) into body ⇒ body becomes [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)].
- Since it's an apple, do not remove tail. So body remains as [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)], with the tail at (5,5).

So from (6,7), head is there, and body has segments at (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). Then, moving RIGHT would take head to (7,7). Check if safe: no collision. Body becomes [(7,7), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. Each segment is adjacent.

Yes, that works. So the moves are UP, UP, and then RIGHT.

Alternatively, another approach could be moving DOWN to (6,4) first, but that's moving away from the apple.

Therefore, the optimal path seems to be moving UP twice and then RIGHT once.

So, the sequence of moves is:

1. Move UP: (6,5) → (6,6).
2. Move UP again: (6,6) → (6,7) [eating the apple].
3. Then move RIGHT: (6,7) → (7,7).

This results in eating the apple on the second move and then moving right.

Alternatively, is there a way to reach the apple in fewer moves? Since it's two units up, but each move can only go one unit, so yes, it takes two UP moves.

But wait, after moving to (6,7), I need to check if that's safe. The body before was [(6,5), (5,5)], and moving to (6,6) is allowed because it's not in the body except as a segment. Then moving to (6,7) would be adjacent to (6,6), so no collision.

So yes, that works.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Move UP.
2. Move UP again to reach apple.
3. Then move RIGHT.

This seems efficient and safe.

I should also check if there's any other path with fewer moves or same number of moves but different directions.

Wait, another option is moving RIGHT first, then UP twice.

Let me see:

1. Move RIGHT: (6,5) → (7,5).
2. Then move UP: (7,5) → (7,6).
3. Then move UP again: (7,6) → (7,7).

But now, the apple is at (6,7), which is to the left of the head at (7,7). To reach it, I would need to move LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7), but that's a reversal since previous direction was UP. So, moving DOWN would be allowed.

Wait, no: after moving UP to (7,7), the last direction was UP. So next move can't be DOWN unless it's not reversing.

Wait, in movement rules: you can't reverse immediately. So if your last move was UP, you can't move DOWN on the next turn.

Therefore, from (7,7), possible directions are UP or RIGHT. But moving UP would take me to (7,8), which is outside grid. Moving RIGHT to (8,7) is allowed but not towards the apple at (6,7).

Alternatively, I could have moved differently.

So perhaps this path isn't as efficient.

Thus, the initial path of two UPs and then a RIGHT seems better because it reaches the apple in two moves.

Wait, actually, no: moving from (6,5) to (6,6) is one move. Then (6,6) to (6,7) is second move, which is eating the apple. So that's two moves to reach the apple, same as any other path.

But in this case, after eating, I can move RIGHT again, whereas if I went another way, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP twice and then LEFT would be an issue because of reversing.

Wait, no: from (6,7), last direction was UP, so next move cannot be DOWN. But LEFT is allowed? Or does moving LEFT count as reversal?

No, moving LEFT is different from moving DOWN. Reversal refers to changing direction in a way that's opposite. So if your last move was UP, you can't immediately do DOWN, but you can do LEFT or RIGHT.

So from (6,7), I could choose to go LEFT to (5,7). But then the body would be [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)] and new head at (5,7). That seems valid as well.

But in terms of efficiency, moving RIGHT is better because it gets closer to the apple's position. Wait, no—the apple is at (6,7); moving LEFT from (6,7) would take me back towards (5,7), which is away from the apple. Whereas moving RIGHT takes me to (7,7).

But since the apple is already eaten, I don't need to go further towards it. It's already consumed.

Wait, actually, after eating the apple, the snake doesn't need to follow any particular path; just needs to avoid collisions.

So both options are valid: moving LEFT or RIGHT from (6,7).

But since the problem is about reaching the apple and not necessarily about what happens after, perhaps it's sufficient to have a path that reaches the apple in two moves.

Therefore, the optimal path is:

- UP
- UP again

This way, I reach the apple quickly and safely.
</think>

To eat the apple at (6,7) from the starting position (6,5), follow these steps:

1. **Move Up**: From (6,5) to (6,6). This move is safe as there are no body segments in that direction.
2. **Move Up Again**: From (6,6) to (6,7). This is the apple's location. Insert the old head position at the front of the body and grow by one segment without removing the tail.

Thus, the sequence of moves is UP then UP again, totaling two moves.

$\boxed{\text{UP, UP}}$
