<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its body or going outside the grid. Let's start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (6,7), and it's moving UP currently. The apple is at (8,6). So, I need to move right twice and down once from the head's position.

Looking at the body cells: [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. This means the snake is currently moving in a way that its body is spread out from (6,3) up to (6,6) and then turns right at (7,5). So, the direction before the current UP might have been RIGHT or something else.

Since the head is moving UP, which increases y by 1 each move. The snake can't reverse direction immediately, so if it's going UP, it can't go DOWN next.

The target is (8,6), which requires moving two steps to the right and one step down from (6,7). So, the movement should involve RIGHT twice and then maybe a DOWN or something else. But I have to make sure that after each move, the new head position doesn't collide with any body cells.

Let me think about possible paths:

Option 1: Move RIGHT first. From (6,7) to (7,7). Then check if this is safe. Looking at the body, (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) are all along x=7 but lower y than 7, so (7,7) should be clear. Then move RIGHT again to (8,7). Now, I need to get down from y=7 to y=6. So next move would be DOWN to (8,6).

Wait, but let's check the order and direction changes.

Current direction is UP, so first move can't be DOWN because it's a reversal. But if we start by moving RIGHT, that's allowed since current direction is UP (so not NONE). Wait, no: rule 3 says snake cannot reverse direction. So, current direction is UP; next direction cannot be DOWN.

So, the possible directions after UP are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again. So, first move can't be DOWN.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Current position (6,7), direction UP.

First move options: LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

If I go UP again, new head is (6,8). But then next step would have to avoid collisions. Let's see where the body is after that.

But let's consider going RIGHT first.

Move 1: RIGHT to (7,7). Now, direction becomes RIGHT because we changed from UP.

Check if this position is safe. The body cells are up to (6,6), so (7,7) is not occupied by the body.

Next move: Can't go LEFT because that would be reversing? Wait, no: previous direction was UP, but now after moving RIGHT, the new direction is RIGHT. So next moves can't reverse from RIGHT; meaning, if current direction is RIGHT, next cannot be LEFT unless it's NONE.

Wait, no. The movement rules say that you can't reverse direction in terms of the opposite direction. For example, if going UP, can't go DOWN next. So moving RIGHT after UP is allowed because RIGHT isn't the opposite of UP. However, once we move to RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT.

So, move 1: RIGHT (allowed).

Move 2: Need to get closer to apple, which requires more RIGHTs or DOWN. But from (7,7), moving further right would take us to (8,7). Then, we need to go down once.

But let's see if that's safe.

Alternatively, maybe another path is better.

Another approach: Since the head is at (6,7) and needs to reach (8,6), perhaps a more efficient path is moving right twice and then down. But I have to make sure each step doesn't cause collision.

But let me think about the body's position after each move.

The body is currently [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So when moving, the tail will move unless the apple is eaten. Since we haven't eaten yet, the tail will shrink.

Wait, no: according to constraint 5, after eating the apple, the body grows by one segment. But before that, each move causes the tail to be removed unless the apple was just eaten.

So, for the first few moves until the apple is eaten, the body remains at its current length minus one each time? Or does it stay the same until the apple is eaten?

Wait, movement update: per move, new head is added, old tail is removed unless an apple is eaten. So as long as we haven't eaten the apple yet, each move removes the last body segment.

But in our case, since we're moving towards the apple, we might eat it on a later move. Let me think about how the body changes with each move.

Let's outline possible moves:

Option 1: Move RIGHT to (7,7). Then direction is RIGHT.

Next move: Since current direction is RIGHT, can't go LEFT next. So options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

Wait, but moving right again would take us to (8,7). Let's check if that's safe.

But wait, the body after the first move would be: original body without the last segment? Or with the new head added?

I think when the snake moves, it adds a new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten. So each step, the body grows only if the apple was just eaten; otherwise, it's the same length.

In our initial state, the head is at (6,7), and the body is [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So total 6 segments in the body. Each move will shift the body forward by one segment.

Wait no: the body list given includes all body cells except the head. So when moving, the new head is added to the front, and the last cell of the body is removed unless an apple was eaten. So with each step, unless the apple is eaten, the length remains the same.

So initially, the snake's total length (including head) is 7 cells: head + 6 body cells.

If we don't eat the apple in a move, then after moving, the tail is removed and the new head is added. So length stays the same.

If we do eat the apple, the tail isn't removed; so length increases by one.

So, as we approach the apple, each move's body will shift accordingly.

Let me try to plan step by step:

Initial position: (6,7), direction UP, body [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)].

First move options: can't go DOWN because current direction is UP. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again.

Option 1: Move RIGHT to (7,7). New head at (7,7). The body will now be [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7)] but since we didn't eat apple, the tail (6,3) is removed. So new body becomes [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7)]. Wait, no: when moving, the head moves, and each body part follows. The body list given is in order from tail to head? Or head to tail?

Wait, I'm confused about the order of the body cells. The list provided is [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So perhaps this represents the snake's body from tail up to just before the head.

So after moving, the new head becomes the front of the body, and the last cell is removed unless apple is eaten.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model each step:

Current head: (6,7)
Body cells: [ (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]

So the snake starts at (6,7), then moves through these body cells towards the head. So the order is tail to head.

When moving in a direction, the new head is added to the front of the list (body plus new head), and if no apple was eaten, the last element is removed.

So, for example:

If we move RIGHT first:

New head: (7,7)
Body becomes [ (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6) ] + [ (7,7) ]
But since no apple eaten yet, remove the last body cell before adding new head.

Wait, no. Wait, in each step:

- The snake's head moves in the given direction.
- The new head is added to the front of the body list.
- If an apple was not eaten, the last element (tail) is removed; if eaten, it remains.

So initial body after moving RIGHT:

New head: (7,7)
Body list becomes [ (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7) ]

But since we didn't eat apple yet, the tail (6,3) is removed. So new body is [ (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7) ].

Wait no: when moving, the head moves and each body part follows. The body list in the input represents all parts except the head, ordered from tail to just before the head.

So after moving RIGHT:

- New head is at (7,7)
- The previous body cells are shifted: each cell takes the position of the next one. So the new body list would be [(6,3) moves to (7,3), but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as each body part follows the head.

Alternatively, maybe I should track the snake's path step by step, making sure that after each move, the new position is not in the updated body.

Let me try moving RIGHT first:

Move 1: RIGHT to (7,7). Direction becomes RIGHT. New body list would be [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7)] because we added (7,7) and removed the last cell (6,3).

Is (7,7) safe? Yes, it's not in the body list after movement.

Move 2: Now at (7,7). Next move can't be LEFT since current direction is RIGHT. So options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

We need to get closer to the apple, which is at (8,6). So moving RIGHT again would take us to (8,7). Let's check:

Move 2: RIGHT to (8,7). Direction becomes RIGHT again. Body list now adds (8,7) and removes (7,3). New body is [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7)].

Is (8,7) safe? Yes.

Now, we need to move DOWN to reach y=6. But current direction is RIGHT; next direction can't be LEFT. So options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. Moving DOWN from (8,7) would take us to (8,6), which is the apple's position.

So Move 3: DOWN to (8,6). Now, since we moved into the apple's position, we eat it. This means:

- Score increases by 1.
- The body grows by one segment; so after this move, the tail isn't removed.

So let's model this:

After eating the apple, new head is at (8,6), and the body will include all previous segments plus the new head, without removing the tail. So the body becomes [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7)] + [ (8,6) ].

Wait, no: when you eat an apple, the snake's length increases by one, so after eating, the body remains as it is plus the new head. So the previous steps' body was [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7)]. After moving DOWN to eat the apple, the new head is at (8,6). Since we ate the apple, the tail isn't removed. So the body becomes [ (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6) ].

But wait, no: in movement update, when an apple is eaten, the new head is added, and the tail isn't removed. So after eating, body includes all previous cells plus new head, so total 7 cells now.

So, after Move 3: DOWN to (8,6), which is the apple. Now, we have successfully eaten it.

But now, according to constraint 4, after eating the apple, we must ensure there's at least one legal move afterward. So, after eating, can the snake move?

After eating, head is at (8,6). The current direction was DOWN for this move. Next moves cannot be UP because that would reverse.

But let's see what's around:

Looking at the new body: [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6)]. So positions occupied are all these cells plus the head at (8,6).

So from (8,6), possible directions:

- LEFT: (7,6) - is this in body? Let's see. The body has (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), etc. (7,6) is not in body.

Wait, let me list all the body cells after eating the apple:

(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6).

So from head at (8,6):

- LEFT: (7,6). Is this in body? Looking through the list, no. So it's safe.

But also, we must check if moving to (7,6) is possible without hitting itself.

Yes, so after eating, there are still moves available.

Wait, but according to constraint 4, after eating, at least one move must be possible. Since from (8,6), LEFT to (7,6) is possible and doesn't collide with body, that's okay.

But wait, let's check: the snake's body after eating includes (8,6). So moving to (7,6): is that a collision?

No, because (7,6) is not in the body list except if it's part of any segment. The body cells are up to (8,7), so no.

Wait, but maybe I made an error here. Let me re-examine:

After eating apple at (8,6):

The snake's body includes all previous segments plus new head, so [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6)].

So the positions are:

(7,4), (7,5): row 7, columns 4 and 5.

(6,5), (6,6): row 6, columns 5 and 6.

(7,7), (8,7): row 7 and 8, column 7.

And head at (8,6).

So when moving LEFT from (8,6) to (7,6), is that position occupied?

Looking at the body cells: (6,6) is in the body. So moving to (7,6) would be adjacent to (6,6). Is (7,6) part of any segment? Let me check:

The body cells are [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6)].

So (7,6) is not in the list. So it's safe to move LEFT.

Therefore, this path works: RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN. After that, the snake can still move.

Alternatively, let me check another possible path:

Option 2: Instead of moving RIGHT twice and then DOWN, what if we move UP or DOWN after first move?

Wait, but initial direction is UP; moving UP again would take us to (6,7), which is where the head was before. That might cause collision with body.

No, wait: if we move UP from (6,7), we'd stay at same position? Or no.

Wait, moving in any direction changes the position unless it's a self-collision. But moving UP from (6,7) would take us to (6,8), which is outside the grid? Wait, assuming the grid is such that y increases upwards or downwards?

Assuming y increases downward, so moving UP decreases y, DOWN increases y.

So initial head at (6,7). Moving UP would go to (6,6).

But wait, perhaps I should clarify the coordinate system. Let's assume it's standard Cartesian coordinates where x increases right and y increases up.

Wait, but that might vary. Alternatively, in grid terms, moving UP could mean decreasing row number if rows are numbered from top.

This is unclear, so perhaps better to consider movement in terms of direction vectors:

- LEFT: (x-1, y)
- RIGHT: (x+1, y)
- UP: (x, y-1)
- DOWN: (x, y+1)

Assuming that the grid's origin is at top-left corner.

But regardless, moving from (6,7) in any direction:

- Moving LEFT would take us to (5,7).
- Moving RIGHT to (7,7).
- Moving UP to (6,6).
- Moving DOWN to (6,8).

Assuming the grid has boundaries; perhaps it's a torus or wraps around. But likely, movement is bounded, and moving beyond edges results in collision.

But since we don't have info on grid size, let's assume that moving outside would result in game over, but for our problem, as long as within bounds, movement is allowed.

So back to initial move options:

After first move RIGHT to (7,7), can we proceed differently?

Move 2: DOWN to (7,6). But is that possible? Let me see.

Wait, current direction after Move 1 was RIGHT. So for Move 2, the next direction can't be LEFT, but it can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

So if I move DOWN from (7,7) to (7,8), assuming y increases downward, that's outside initial grid? Or perhaps within bounds.

But since we don't have grid size info, let's assume movement is allowed as long as within the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps better to focus on the problem: what's the shortest path?

From (6,7) to (8,6): requires moving 2 steps right and 1 step down. So minimal moves are RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN.

Which seems to be a valid path without self-collision.

But let me verify:

Move 1: RIGHT to (7,7). Body after this move is [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7)].

Is (7,7) in the body? No. So it's safe.

Move 2: RIGHT again to (8,7). Body after this move is [(7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,7)].

Is (8,7) in the body? No. Safe.

Move 3: DOWN to (8,6). Now at apple's position.

So this path works.

But wait, after Move 2, when we are at (8,7), what is the direction? It was RIGHT for both moves, so next move can't be LEFT. So moving DOWN from (8,7) is allowed.

Yes.

Alternatively, another possible path:

Move 1: UP to (6,6). Then Move 2: RIGHT twice and DOWN once.

Wait, let's see.

Initial position: (6,7), direction UP. Can we move UP? Let's check if that causes collision.

Moving UP from (6,7) would take us to (6,6). The body cells after moving would be [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)] -> new head at (6,6).

But since we moved UP, the direction is now UP. Then, the next move can't be DOWN.

Wait, but moving to (6,6): is that position already occupied by body?

Yes, because the body includes (6,5), (6,6) after initial move? Wait no:

Original body: [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)].

Wait, no: wait, the initial body is given as [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)], which are all cells except the head at (6,7).

So when moving UP to (6,6), that's adding a new head at (6,6). But since (6,6) is already in the body list, this would cause collision. So it's invalid.

Therefore, can't move UP as first move.

Similarly, trying other initial moves:

Move 1: LEFT to (5,7). Is that safe?

After moving LEFT, new head at (5,7). Body becomes [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,7)].

But since we didn't eat apple, the last body cell is removed. So new body is [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,7)].

Is (5,7) in this new body? No, because it's just added and hasn't been processed yet. Wait no: the body after moving LEFT would be [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,7)]. So (5,7) is now part of the body.

But since we moved to (5,7), which was not in the previous body except for the head. But after moving, it's added as a new cell. Wait, no: when you move LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7), that position wasn't occupied by any body cells before.

Because original body is [(6,3), (7,3), etc. So (5,7) is new and safe.

So moving LEFT first may be an option.

But let's see where it leads:

After Move 1: LEFT to (5,7). Direction now LEFT.

Next move can't be RIGHT.

From (5,7), need to reach (8,6). How?

Perhaps move DOWN a few times and then RIGHT.

But moving directionally is limited by the previous move's direction.

Wait, no. Each move can be any direction except the opposite of the last one.

So from LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT, but can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again? Wait, no: typically in such games, you can't reverse direction immediately. So after moving LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT, but can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again (if allowed by grid boundaries).

But perhaps it's better to consider that each turn must be at least 90 degrees, i.e., can't go back the way you came.

Assuming that, after moving LEFT, next moves can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again? Or is it only orthogonal directions?

I think in such problems, you can change direction freely except that you can't reverse direction immediately. So for example, if you move LEFT, your next move can't be RIGHT, but can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But this depends on the specific rules of the game. Since it's not specified, perhaps we can assume that movement is allowed in any direction except the opposite one.

Therefore, from (5,7), after moving LEFT, we can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT again.

But let's see:

From (5,7):

Option 1: Move DOWN to (5,8). Then maybe RIGHT thrice and DOWN once?

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a longer path but avoids collision.

But the minimal moves would be better.

Alternatively, moving from (5,7) to (5,6), then RIGHT thrice to reach x=8, y=6.

Let me try:

Move 1: LEFT to (5,7).

Move 2: DOWN to (5,6). Now at (5,6). Direction is DOWN.

Next move can't be UP.

So Move 3: RIGHT to (6,6). Check if safe.

Body after Move 2 was [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,7)] and moved DOWN to (5,6), so new head at (5,6).

But (5,6) is not in the body list except for the previous step.

Wait, no: after moving LEFT then DOWN, the body would be:

Original body after Move 1: [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,7)].

Moving DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). So new head at (5,6).

Body becomes [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,7)] -> after moving, the last cell is removed and new head added. Wait, no: when you move, the snake's body follows.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this:

Each time you move, the head moves in the chosen direction, and the tail follows by removing the previous head position unless you eat food (which grows the snake).

In our case, we are moving towards the apple at (8,6), which is food. So when we reach it, the snake grows.

But until then, each move shifts the snake's body forward, with the tail following.

So let's model this:

Initial state: head at (6,7), body cells [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)].

Move 1: LEFT to (5,7). Now, the new head is (5,7), and the tail cell (6,7) is removed. So body becomes [(5,7), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5)].

Wait no: actually, when you move, each segment follows the previous one. So perhaps it's better to represent the snake as a list where the first element is the head and the rest are body segments in order.

So initial snake: [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3)].

Wait, perhaps I should clarify how the body follows. Each move shifts all body segments to follow the head.

But regardless, after each move, the snake's body is updated by removing the last segment and adding a new head in the direction moved.

So for Move 1: LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7).

Snake becomes [(5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)].

Wait, no. The tail is removed when moving, unless food is eaten.

But since we haven't eaten the apple yet, each move just shifts the snake forward without growing.

So initial length is 7 segments: head at (6,7), then body cells [(6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3)].

After moving LEFT:

Head becomes (5,7). Tail is removed (the last cell is gone).

So new snake: [(5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)].

Wait, no. When moving, the head moves, and each body segment takes the position of the previous one. So:

Previous positions:

Head: (6,7)

Body: [ (6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3) ]

After moving LEFT to (5,7):

New head: (5,7)

Old body segments move forward:

So new body becomes [ (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) ]

But the tail at (6,3) is removed.

Therefore, snake after Move 1: [(5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)].

Now, check for collision: head is at (5,7). The body cells are from (6,7) down. So no collision with itself.

Move 2: DOWN from (5,7) to (5,8). Now new head is (5,8).

Snake becomes [(5,8), (5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4)].

Check collision: no.

Move 3: RIGHT from (5,8) to (6,8). Snake updates.

But wait, direction after Move 2 was DOWN, so next move can't be UP. But can it be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again?

Assuming that you can change direction except reversing.

So after moving DOWN, next move can't be UP.

So from DOWN, next directions allowed: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.

But in this case, to reach (8,6), perhaps better to go right.

So Move 3: RIGHT to (6,8).

Snake becomes [(6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (7,5)].

No collision.

Move 4: RIGHT again to (7,8). Snake updates.

Move 5: RIGHT again to (8,8). But target is at (8,6).

This seems like a longer path. Alternatively, perhaps after some rights and downs.

But this might not be optimal. The minimal moves seem to be 3 steps as in the first approach.

Therefore, probably the shortest path is moving RIGHT twice and DOWN once.

So the directions would be RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN.

Thus, the answer is \boxed{R R D}
</think>

The problem involves navigating a snake from its initial position to an apple located at (8, 6) on a grid. The snake starts at position (6, 7) and must move without colliding with itself. The goal is to find the shortest path.

1. **Initial Analysis**: The snake needs to move right twice and down once to reach the target efficiently.
2. **Movement Constraints**: Each move can be in any direction except the opposite of the previous move.
3. **Path Determination**:
   - Move 1: RIGHT from (6, 7) to (7, 7).
   - Move 2: RIGHT from (7, 7) to (8, 7).
   - Move 3: DOWN from (8, 7) to (8, 6).

This path ensures the snake does not collide with itself and reaches the target in the minimal number of moves.

### Final Answer
The shortest path is \boxed{R R D}

- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
