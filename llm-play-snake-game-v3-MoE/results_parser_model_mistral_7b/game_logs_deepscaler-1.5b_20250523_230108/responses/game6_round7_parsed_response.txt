{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP"], "reasoning": "The main objective of this path planning is to navigate a snake from (2, 2) towards (7, 9). The solution involves moving in directions that avoid immediate reversals and ensure each new head position is valid. Here, we first move right until near the y-coordinate of the target (x=7), then adjust direction to face upwards. The path ensures the snake approaches efficiently without hitting obstacles or body segments except when eating the apple."}
