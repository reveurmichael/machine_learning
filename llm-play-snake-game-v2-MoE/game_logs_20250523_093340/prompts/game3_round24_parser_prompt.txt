<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (7,0), and the apple is at (8,0). The current direction is RIGHT. The body is at (5,0) and (6,0). So the snake is currently moving to the right. The next step is to get to the apple, which is just one step to the right. But wait, the body is in the way. Let me think about the positions.

The head is at (7,0), and the body is at (5,0) and (6,0). So if the snake moves right, the next head position would be (8,0), which is where the apple is. But then, the body would be moving as well. Let me check the movement rules. When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. Since the apple is at (8,0), if the snake moves there, it would eat the apple, so the tail doesn't shrink. Let me simulate this.

Current body is [(5,0), (6,0)]. Head is (7,0). If the snake moves RIGHT, the new head is (8,0). The body would then become [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)]? Wait, no. Wait, the body is updated by adding the new head and removing the tail. Wait, the original body is [(5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (7,0). When moving right, the new head is (8,0). Then, the body would be the previous head (7,0) added to the body, and the tail (5,0) is removed? No, because the body list is [(5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (7,0). So the body is the segments after the head. So when moving, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten.

So, when moving to (8,0), which is the apple's position, the snake eats the apple. Therefore, the body should not remove the tail. So the body would become [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)]? Wait, no. Wait, the body list is the positions of the body segments excluding the head. So the original body is [(5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (7,0). So the full snake is head (7,0) followed by body segments (5,0) and (6,0)? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because normally, the body follows the head. So if the head is at (7,0), then the next body segment would be (6,0), then (5,0). So the body list is [(5,0), (6,0)], which is the segments after the head. So when the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten.

So, moving right to (8,0) would make the new head (8,0). Since the apple is eaten, the tail is not removed. Therefore, the body becomes [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)]. Wait, but the original body was [(5,0), (6,0)], and the head was (7,0). So after moving, the new head is (8,0), and the body becomes the previous head (7,0) and the original body (5,0), (6,0). So the body is [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)]? That seems correct. But then, after eating the apple, the snake's length increases by one. Wait, the problem says that eating the apple increases the body by one segment. So the body would have one more segment. So the body would be [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)]? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me recheck. The movement rule says: when the apple is eaten, the tail doesn't shrink on the next move. So normally, when moving, the tail is removed. But if the apple is eaten, the tail remains. So the body length increases by one. So in this case, moving to the apple's position would mean that the tail is not removed. So the body list would be the previous head (7,0) and the original body [(5,0), (6,0)], making the new body [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (8,0). So the snake's body now has three segments.

But the problem is that when the snake moves to (8,0), which is the apple's position, the head is at (8,0). However, the next step after eating the apple, the snake's body would be [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)], and the head is at (8,0). So the next move would need to be safe. But the user's requirement says that after eating the apple, we need to ensure that there's at least one legal move afterward. Let me check.

So if the snake moves to (8,0), which is the apple, then the body is [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)]. Now, the head is at (8,0). The next move can't be LEFT because that would take the head to (7,0), which is part of the body. So the snake would die. Therefore, moving directly to the apple would result in the next move being impossible. Hence, this path is not safe.

So the initial idea of moving directly to the apple is not safe, because after eating it, the next move would be blocked by the body. Therefore, the snake needs to find a path that allows it to reach the apple, but also have a way to move after that.

So, what's the alternative? The snake is at (7,0), direction is RIGHT. The apple is at (8,0). Let's see: moving right would take the head to (8,0), but then the body would be (7,0), (5,0), (6,0). The next move can't be left (as that would collide with the body at (7,0)), but maybe up or down. But the snake is at (8,0), which is on the bottom row (y=0). So moving down would take it to y=-1, which is out of bounds. So the only possible move after that is up. But is that possible?

Wait, the head is at (8,0). The body is [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)]. So the next move can be UP (to (8,1)), which is valid. So in that case, moving right to eat the apple, then moving up would be possible. So maybe that's okay.

Wait, but the problem says that after eating the apple, we need to ensure there's at least one legal move. So if the snake moves to (8,0), then the body is [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)], and the next move can be UP. That's allowed. So maybe that's acceptable.

But wait, the initial movement is allowed. Let me confirm. The movement to (8,0) is valid because the head is moving to (8,0), which is not part of the body. The body is at (5,0), (6,0), and the head was at (7,0). So moving to (8,0) would not collide with the body. Because the body is (5,0), (6,0), and the new head is (8,0). So that's okay. Then, after eating the apple, the body is [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (8,0). So the next move can be up, which is valid. So maybe that's okay.

But why is the initial thought that moving directly to the apple is not safe? Because after eating, the next move is possible. So maybe that's acceptable.

Wait, but the problem says that the snake must avoid traps after eating the apple. So in this case, after moving to (8,0) and eating the apple, the next move can be up. So that's safe. So the initial plan is to move right once. But let me check the movement rules again.

The current direction is RIGHT. So the first move can't be LEFT (because that's the reverse direction). But the first move is RIGHT, which is allowed.

So the moves would be ["RIGHT"], and the reasoning is that moving right takes the head to the apple, which is safe, and after that, the snake can move up.

But wait, the body after moving right is [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (8,0). So the next move is up to (8,1), which is valid. So that's acceptable.

But then, why is this a problem? Because the initial thought was that the next move might be blocked, but in reality, it's not. So maybe the correct answer is to move right once.

But wait, what if the body is in the way when moving right? Let me check again. The current head is at (7,0). The body is [(5,0), (6,0)]. Moving right to (8,0) would not collide with the body. The body is at (5,0) and (6,0), which are to the left of the head. So the new head is (8,0), which is not in the body. So that's safe.

So the move is valid. Therefore, the answer is ["RIGHT"], and the reasoning is that moving right directly to the apple is safe, and after eating, the snake can move up.

But why did I think there was a problem before? Maybe I confused the body positions. Let me recheck. The original body is [(5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (7,0). So the body is behind the head. So when moving right, the head moves to (8,0), which is not in the body. So that's valid. Then, after eating the apple, the body is [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (8,0). So the next move can be up or down. Down is invalid (y=-1), but up is valid. So that's okay.

So the correct answer is to move right once. Therefore, the JSON should be:

{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving directly right to the apple at (8,0) is safe. After eating, the snake can move up to avoid collision."
}

But wait, the problem says that the snake's body is [(5,0), (6,0)], and the head is (7,0). So the body is behind the head. So moving right to (8,0) would not collide with the body. But when the snake moves, the body segments shift. So after moving, the body becomes [(7,0), (5,0), (6,0)], which is correct. So that's safe.

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is simply to move right once.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 0) and whose body cells are in list format [(5, 0), (6, 0)], to eat the apple at (8, 0).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 contains the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
