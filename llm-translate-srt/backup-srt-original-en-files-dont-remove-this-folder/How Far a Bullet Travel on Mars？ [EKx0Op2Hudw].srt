If you brought a pistol with you to
Mars, what would happen if you fired it?

00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
Mars, what would happen if you fired it?
 

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,470
Mars, what would happen if you fired it?
Because Mars' gravity is 1/3 of Earth's,

00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
Because Mars' gravity is 1/3 of Earth's,
 

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,030
Because Mars' gravity is 1/3 of Earth's,
the bullet would travel much farther.

8
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
the bullet would travel much farther.
 

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,950
the bullet would travel much farther.
But just how much farther are we talking

But just how much farther are we talking

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,110
But just how much farther are we talking
about here? While the thin atmosphere

about here? While the thin atmosphere
 

13
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,590
about here? While the thin atmosphere
would create some resistance, the bullet

14
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600
would create some resistance, the bullet
 

15
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,269
would create some resistance, the bullet
could travel up to 12 m or 20 km before
