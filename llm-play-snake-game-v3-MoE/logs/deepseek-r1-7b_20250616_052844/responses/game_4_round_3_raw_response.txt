========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to help the snake get from its current position (2,8) to the apple at (4,4). Let me go through this step by step.

First, let's note down all the given information:

- Head is at (2,8).
- Current direction is "LEFT".
- Body cells are [(3,8), (4,8)]. So from the head, the next segment is (3,8), then (4,8). The apple is at (4,4).

The snake's movement depends on its current direction and whether it can move without colliding. Since the current direction is LEFT, moving left would decrease the x-coordinate by 1 each time.

Wait, but if the head is at (2,8) and direction is LEFT, then the next position when moving would be (1,8). But that might not be towards the apple. Maybe I should consider changing direction to move towards the apple instead.

Hmm, let's calculate the difference between the head's current position and the apple. The x-coordinate goes from 2 to 4: so right by 2 units. The y-coordinate goes from 8 down to 4: so down by 4 units. So overall, we need to move RIGHT twice and DOWN four times.

But moving straight without turning might lead into the body or itself. Let me check if that's possible.

Right now, the head is at (2,8), body at (3,8) and (4,8). The apple is at (4,4). So from (2,8), moving RIGHT would take it to (3,8), but that's already occupied by a body segment. Oh wait, because when we move, the new head is inserted at the front of the body list. So the first move might actually not have an immediate collision.

Wait no: The movement rules say that in step 2, the new head position must not coincide with any BODYi except if it's about to eat the apple and grow.

So for the initial move from (2,8) LEFT would go to (1,8). That seems safe because the body is at higher x-coordinates. But maybe moving LEFT isn't helpful towards getting to (4,4).

Alternatively, if I try to turn direction when possible without reversing immediately after a non-start move.

Wait, according to PATH-PLANNING GUIDELINES: Must not reverse direction on the first move. So since this is the initial move, we can choose either LEFT or maybe another direction if it's safe and towards the apple.

But let me think about turning up or down instead of left initially.

Alternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT twice to get closer in x-coordinate, then move DOWN multiple times.

Wait, but starting at (2,8), moving right once would take us to (3,8) which is a body cell. That's bad because the next step after that would insert the head there, making it collide with the tail? Or wait: when you move right, the old head is inserted in front of the body.

So if current direction is LEFT and we decide to turn RIGHT instead, maybe that's possible?

Wait no, directions can't be reversed on first move. Since current direction is LEFT, moving RIGHT would involve reversing, which isn't allowed until after more moves.

Hmm, this complicates things. So initial moves must not reverse from LEFT.

So perhaps the first step should be to move in a different direction towards getting closer to the apple without hitting the body or walls.

Wait: (2,8) is the current head position with direction LEFT. So moving left is possible as long as it doesn't cause collision. But if I try to move RIGHT instead on first step, that's allowed since we haven't reversed yet?

No, wait PATH-PLANNING GUIDELINES say "Must not reverse": so perhaps after a non-start move, you can reverse direction.

Wait no: according to the problem statement, movement update rule 2 says cannot reverse. So if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be DOWN or RIGHT? Or maybe it's referring to immediate reversal from LEFT to RIGHT as in two steps?

I think I need to clarify this.

In the initial step, since the snake hasn't moved yet, choosing a different direction than LEFT would require not being a reverse. But according to rule 2: Cannot reverse direction on the first move; if current is LEFT, next cannot be RIGHT or DOWN? Or maybe it's only immediate reversal that's prohibited?

Wait, problem statement says:

"CANNOT REVERSE": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"â†”"RIGHT". So if current is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. Similarly, from RIGHT, next cannot be LEFT.

So in our case, starting with direction LEFT, we cannot move RIGHT on first step. So options are UP or DOWN.

Wait, but moving UP would take head to (2,9), which is outside grid bounds because y must be <10. But wait coordinates range up to 9. So (2,8) + UP would be (2,9). Oh no, that's beyond the grid since x and y are from 0 to 9 inclusive? Wait: The problem statement says coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. So (x,y) can be up to (9,9), meaning y=8 is near the top.

So moving UP from (2,8) would take it to (2,9), which is outside grid bounds. So that's invalid.

Moving DOWN would take head to (2,7). That seems valid and moves closer towards apple at (4,4).

Wait: So initial move options after being in LEFT direction are limited. We can only move UP or DOWN on first step, but moving UP may cause it to go out of bounds because (2,9) is beyond the grid as per coordinates up to 9.

So actually, moving UP from (2,8): y becomes 9, which is allowed since maximum y is 9. Wait wait: The problem statement says "coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right." So both x and y can be up to 9.

Wait no, the initial position is given as (2,8). So moving UP would take it to (2,9), which is within grid. Moving DOWN: (2,7).

So for first move options:

- Move UP: new head at (2,9)
But then check if that's safe.

Is (2,9) occupied by any body cell? Body cells are [(3,8), (4,8)], so no. So moving UP would be possible as long as after movement, the new head doesn't collide with body.

Wait: in step 2 of movement rules:

Check for collisions using state before body shifts.

So when considering moving to (2,9):

The current body is [(3,8), (4,8)] and tail will move if not eaten. So check if (2,9) is in the current body list. It's at (3,8), no. So it would be safe.

Then in step 3:

Update body positions: insert old head (2,8) at front of body => new body is [(2,8), (3,8), (4,8)]. Then if apple isn't eaten (we moved UP to (2,9)), then remove the tail. So new body becomes [(2,8), (3,8)].

So new state would be head at (2,9), body [(2,8), (3,8)].

That seems okay.

But moving UP may not be ideal because we're moving away from the apple in terms of x-coordinate; apple is at 4. So after this move, to get closer in x, maybe a right turn is needed later.

Alternatively, if I can't move UP due to some other issue? Wait (2,9) is valid as it's within grid.

So moving UP seems possible. Then from there, perhaps change direction towards RIGHT and DOWN.

Wait: Alternatively, moving DOWN first would get us closer in x-coordinate while staying on y=7 or something else.

Let me consider both options:

Option 1: Move UP to (2,9) as initial move.

But that might not help reach the apple at (4,4). So perhaps better to find a path towards it.

Alternatively, Option 2: Can we reverse direction? Since current is LEFT, next cannot be RIGHT. But if after some moves, could we turn RIGHT?

Wait, according to the CANNOT REVERSE rule, from LEFT you can't go RIGHT on immediate next move. So first step options are UP or DOWN only.

So moving DOWN seems better as it brings us closer in x-coordinate towards 4.

Moving down: new head is (2,7). Now check for collisions:

- The current body cells after movement would be [(3,8), (4,8)] before the move. Wait no: when you insert the old head at front of body and then remove tail if not eating apple.

Wait actually, in step 3a: Insert old head to front of body.

So after moving DOWN:

New body is [(2,7), (3,8), (4,8)]. Then since we didn't eat the apple, remove the last element. So new body becomes [(2,7), (3,8)].

Check for collisions between new head and current body: (2,7) isn't in [(3,8), (4,8)], so safe.

Now position is (2,7). Next move should be towards increasing x to reach 4. So RIGHT direction would take us to (1,7)? No, because moving RIGHT from (2,7) decreases x by 1, which takes it to (3,7).

Wait: Wait current head is at (2,7), and direction was DOWN earlier.

If we decide to turn RIGHT now, can we?

But the current direction is DOWN. Moving RIGHT would change x-coordinate but doesn't reverse direction as from LEFT; moving RIGHT isn't prohibited unless you are in LEFT direction.

So if previous direction was DOWN, next moves can be LEFT or RIGHT without restriction (as long as not reversing from UP/Down).

Wait no: CANNOT REVERSE refers to specific directions. For example, from LEFT, cannot move RIGHT because that's immediate reversal; but moving from LEFT to another non-right direction is allowed.

So now, current head at (2,7), body [(3,8), (4,8)] after first step if we had moved UP or DOWN?

Wait no: in the initial step of moving DOWN:

- New head is (2,7)
- Old head was (2,8); inserted into front of body [(3,8), (4,8)], so new body becomes [(2,8), (3,8), (4,8)]. But since not eating apple, remove tail. So new body is [(2,8), (3,8)].

So now, with head at (2,7) and body [(3,8), (4,8)], what can we do next?

If current direction was DOWN but after moving, the direction isn't maintained? Or does movement update rule change based on previous step?

Wait no: The current direction is kept unless changed by a new move.

So perhaps to proceed towards the apple at (4,4), from (2,7):

We need x to increase by 2 and y to decrease by 3. So moving RIGHT twice and DOWN three times.

But let's plan this:

From (2,8) direction LEFT: can't reverse unless after some steps.

Option: First move UP is possible but may not be optimal. Let me try Option of first moving DOWN, then RIGHT multiple times.

So initial movement: DOWN to (2,7). Next step:

Move RIGHT: new head would be (3,7). Check if that's in current body [(3,8), (4,8)].

No collision except the new position. So safe.

Then, next move can we change direction again? Let me see.

After moving to (3,7):

Body becomes [(2,7), (3,8), (4,8)] but wait: when you insert old head at front and remove tail:

- Inserting (2,8) in front of body [(3,8), (4,8)], making new body [(2,8), (3,8), (4,8)]. Then since not eating apple, remove last element.

So after moving RIGHT to (3,7), the new body is [(2,8), (3,8)] again. Wait no: Because previous step's body was [(3,8), (4,8)], inserting (2,8) makes it [(2,8), 3,8, 4,8], then removing last element to get [(2,8), (3,8)].

So from there, if next move is UP: would take us back to where we were before moving DOWN first. Hmm that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps from (3,7), the direction could be changed to another movement towards apple.

Wait, but this seems like a loop or maybe getting stuck in cycles.

Perhaps trying a different initial step.

Option 1: Move DOWN to (2,7). Then next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse? Or is it allowed?

No, from direction DOWN, the next can be any except reversal which isn't possible as moving LEFT doesn't reverse. So yes, movement after being in DOWN allows moving LEFT or RIGHT.

So perhaps now, with head at (3,7), body [(2,8), (3,8)], and current direction is RIGHT? Or maybe changing direction to something else.

Wait no: Wait when we moved from (2,8) to (3,7), the movement was RIGHT. So the new direction remains RIGHT unless changed by another move.

Alternatively, maybe I can adjust the path so that after some moves, the body doesn't block my way.

This is getting complex; perhaps trying a different approach: visualizing the current snake positions and planning a path.

Current head position: (2,8), with body at [(3,8), (4,8)]. So:

Positions along the snake are:
- Head: (2,8)
- Body 1: (3,8)
- Body 2: (4,8)

The apple is at (4,4). The tail isn't given but probably depends on previous moves.

So from head's position, to reach the apple:

Need to move x from 2â†’4 and y from 8â†’4.

Possible path:

Move DOWN multiple times to decrease y. But moving DOWN would make snake longer in that direction until it can turn RIGHT or LEFT towards increasing x.

Alternatively, perhaps move down twice: (2,6), but then adjust with turns.

But let me try a possible sequence of moves:

1. Move DOWN from (2,8) â†’ (2,7)
   - New body becomes [(2,8), (3,8)] after step 3.
   
2. From (2,7): move RIGHT to (3,7). Check for collision: current body is [(3,8), (4,8)], so yes, (3,7) isn't in the body.

   - New head at (3,7)
   - Body becomes [insert old head (2,7)] + existing body â†’ [(2,7), (3,8), (4,8)]. Since not eating apple, remove tail: [(2,7), (3,8)]
   
3. From (3,7): move RIGHT again to (4,7). Check collision:

   - New head at (4,7)
   - Body before movement was [(2,7), (3,8)]. After inserting old head (3,7) â†’ [(3,7), (2,7), (3,8)]. Remove tail: [(3,7), (2,7)]
   
Wait that seems off. Alternatively:

No, after step 3, moving from (3,7):

- Insert old head at front of body [(2,7), (3,8)] â†’ new body becomes [(3,7), (2,7), (3,8)]. Then remove last element because not eating apple: so it's [(3,7), (2,7)]
   
Wait that would make the snake have two segments? That can't be right.

I think I'm getting confused with how the body is updated. Let me re-examine:

When moving in a certain direction:
- Insert old head at front of current body.
- If new position isn't apple: remove last element (tail).

So after step 1, movement to (2,7) and body becomes [(2,8), (3,8)].

Step 2: Move RIGHT from (2,7) â†’ (3,7). Insert old head at front of current body [(2,8), (3,8)]. So new body is [(3,7), (2,8), (3,8)]. Since not eating apple, remove tail: now body becomes [(3,7), (2,8)].

Wait that's different. So after moving to (3,7):

- The snake has head at (3,7), and the body is [(2,8), (3,8)].
   
No, wait:

Old head was (2,7). When you move RIGHT from there, new position is (3,7). Then before movement: the current body cells were [(2,8), (3,8)]. So after moving to (3,7):

- Insert old head at front of body â†’ [ (2,7) ] + existing body. Wait no:

Old head was (2,7)? No, wait: initial head position is before movement.

Wait in step 1, we moved from (2,8) to (2,7). So new head is (2,7), old head would be (2,8).

Ah yes, so moving from (2,7):

- Insert old head which was at (2,8).
So body after movement: [ (2,8) ] + current body [(3,8)] â†’ [ (2,8), (3,8) ]. Then remove tail if not eating apple. So new body is [ (2,8), (3,8) ].
   
Wait no:

Wait the initial step was moving to (2,7). Current head is now (2,7).

But in movement update rule 3: Insert old head into front of current body.

So before this move, the snake's body after step 1 would be [ (2,8), (3,8) ].

Wait no:

After moving to (2,7), the steps are:

- Insert old head at front â†’ insert (2,8) in front of [(3,8)].
So new body is [ (2,8), (3,8) ].
   
Then remove tail only if didn't eat apple. So since we moved to (2,7) which isn't the apple location (4,4), so tail is removed.

Wait no: in step 3:

- If not eating apple, remove last element of body before adding new head.

So after inserting old head at front and getting [ (2,8), (3,8) ] as temporary list, then since we didn't eat apple, we need to get rid of the tail.

The current body is [(2,8), (3,8)] â†’ removing last element gives us [(2,8)].

So after moving from (2,7):

- The new head is (3,7)
- Current body was [ (2,8) ]

Wait no: Let me clarify:

After movement to (3,7):

1. Insert old head into front of current body. Old head at that step was (2,7). Current body before this move was [(3,8)].

So inserting (2,7) â†’ new temporary list is [ (2,7), (3,8) ]

But since we didn't eat apple, remove tail: so the new body becomes [ (2,7) ].

Wait no:

No. Wait the initial step after moving to (2,7):

- Body was [(2,8), (3,8)].
   
When you move RIGHT from (2,7) â†’ (3,7). Insert old head which is (2,7) at front of body? Or wait: I'm getting mixed up.

No:

In the initial step when moving to (2,7):

- The new head was inserted into front of current body [(3,8)], but actually no. Wait after first movement:

Step 1:

Start with snake's body as [(3,8),4,8]. Move DOWN from head at (2,8) â†’ position is (2,7).

So insert old head (2,8) into front of current body: which was [(3,8)] â†’ new temporary list becomes [ (2,8), (3,8) ].

Since not eating apple, remove tail â†’ resulting in body being [ (2,8) ]

Wait this is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach would be to think about the snake's position and possible moves without tracking each step precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps trying an alternative initial move: moving RIGHT or LEFT but that seems counterintuitive given current direction is LEFT.

But in any case, the goal is to reach (4,4) from (2,8). So with two steps to go on y-axis, and four steps needed for x. So 6 moves in total?

Wait:

From (2,8):

- Move DOWN twice: 8â†’7â†’6
But then need to move RIGHT four times.
   
Alternatively, perhaps it's better to not limit ourselves by movement constraints.

Maybe moving right once would take us from (2,8) â†’(3,8), which is the first body segment. So that would be collision if we try again.

So probably can't do that.

Alternative plan:

1. Move DOWN: (2,7)
   
2. Then RIGHT: to (4,8). But wait current head at (2,7); moving right once gets us to (3,7), then two times more to (5,7) which is beyond the apple's x of 4.

Wait this seems problematic.

Alternatively:

1. Move DOWN three times: from (2,8)â†’(2,7)â†’(2,6)â†’(2,5)
   
But that may not be efficient.

Alternatively:

Perhaps trying a spiral-like movement towards the target.

Alternatively, perhaps using a U-turn approach.

From initial position:

- Move down to (2,7), then right multiple times.

Wait:

1. Move DOWN â†’ (2,7) without collision
2. Then move RIGHT as much as possible until head can turn back UP or something else.

But this is too vague.

Alternatively: Maybe trying a right-turning spiral.

Another approach could be to consider the snake's body and avoid blocking itself.

Given that the current body after first step when moving down would have only one segment (head at 2,8) followed by (3,8),4,8. Wait no:

Wait initial positions: head is (2,8). Body segments are [(3,8), (4,8)].

So if I move DOWN to (2,7):

- The new body would be [ (2,7) inserted at front of existing body ] â†’ but wait the insertion step and removal of tail makes it complicated.

Wait perhaps the key is that moving towards lower y (DOWN) will allow us to adjust x later. But due to current position's body blocking some directions.

Alternatively:

Perhaps if we move right twice while maintaining a path down.

But I'm getting stuck here, maybe trying to think in terms of grid and possible moves step by step without getting tangled in the exact snake body steps.

So from (2,8), with direction LEFT, first options are to either move DOWN or RIGHT. But moving RIGHT would make head towards 3,7 which is in a different row but same column as another part of body. Wait no: because the initial body is at (3,8) and (4,8).

So from (2,8):

Move right once â†’ position (3,8). But that's already occupied by the first segment? Or not?

Wait initial positions:

- Head: 2,8

- Body segments: 3,8; 4,8.

So moving RIGHT to 3,8 would collide with the body, so that is prohibited. Hence cannot move right immediately as it will hit itself.

Thus, only possible first move from (2,8) is DOWN â†’ since left movement would be towards head and cause collision.

Wait is that true? Wait no: Direction was given as LEFT in initial conditions; but moving LEFT again may not be allowed if that's a reversal. But according to the rules, previous direction doesn't prevent you from moving the same direction unless it causes body collision. So perhaps moving left again (if possible) might be prohibited due to self-collision.

But since head is at 2,8 and body starts at 3,8,4,8; if we move LEFT from 2,8: new position would be 1,8 which isn't occupied by any body segments. So no collision?

Wait that's an important point!

So perhaps I was wrong earlier to assume movement left is prohibited because it doesn't reverse direction.

Wait:

If the current direction is LEFT (from initial step), moving LEFT again wouldn't reverse direction; rather it would continue in same direction, which may not be possible if head would move into body.

But with initial position at 2,8 and body segments at 3,8 and 4,8: moving LEFT from 2,8 would take the snake to 1,8. Since there's no one there, it's allowed.

So perhaps step 0 is:

Current head: (2,8), direction left

Step 1 options:
- Move LEFT â†’ (1,8)
- Move DOWN â†’(2,7)

But moving RIGHT from here isn't possible because the next position would be 3,8 which is already in body.

Thus, better to move down first.

Let me try this plan:

Move down twice and then turn right as needed. Let's see step by step:

1. Move DOWN: (2,7)
   - Insert old head (2,8) into front of current body [(3,8),4,8], so new body becomes [2,8; 3,8]
   Wait I'm getting confused again.

Wait better to consider each movement carefully step by step:

Current state:
- Head: (2,7)
- Body: [(3,8), (4,8)]
- Direction: LEFT

Step 1: Move DOWN from (2,7) â†’ y decreases by 1. So new head at (2,6).

Is this position in current body? Current body is [3,8;4,8]. No collision except for the body.

So movement allowed:

- Insert old head (2,7) into front of body [(3,8),4,8] â†’ new temporary list: [ (2,7), 3,8], then remove tail since not eating apple. So new body is [2,7].

Wait no: Wait after moving to (2,6):

- Insert old head at front â†’ (2,7) inserted into [(3,8);4,8] â†’ temporary list becomes [2,7; 3,8;4,8]. Since not eating apple, remove last element. So body is now [2,7].

Thus after this movement:

- Head: (2,6)
- Body: [2,7]

Wait that seems like the snake has only one segment? That can't be right because normally the body is built from previous segments.

Hmm maybe I'm misunderstanding how the insertion and deletion works.

Alternate approach to think about it: each time we move, insert the old head into front of current body, then remove last element if not eating apple. So:

Step 1 after moving down once:
- Old head was (2,7). Inserted at front â†’ [2,7;3,8]
- Since didn't eat apple, removed last element â†’ new body is [2,7]

So now the snake has only one segment: from head to tail. So this might complicate movement.

Therefore, perhaps not moving down immediately isn't better because it would cause the snake's body to collapse into a single segment after first move.

Alternatively, maybe that indicates you can't do certain movements because of self-collisions later on.

Wait but if we have:

After step 1: head at (2,6), body is [2,7]

Then next movement options are based on new position and direction. The snake's direction was DOWN in this case.

But with only a single segment now, moving in any direction would be possible except collision.

Wait no, but if the snake has only one segment after first move, it can't turn directions because that might cause itself to hit body segments?

This is getting too confusing without accurate tracking. Maybe it's better to find an alternative strategy or model this problem as a graph traversal with state (head position and direction) and possible moves.

But since I'm trying to do this manually, perhaps another approach: think about the minimal path from current head to apple, considering that snake can't cross its own body.

Given the initial positions:

- Head at 2,8
- Body parts:3,8;4,8

The goal is (4,4). So need to get x from 2â†’4 and y from 8â†’4. So movement pattern needs to decrease both x and y appropriately.

Perhaps moving down twice first then right four times? But that would cause self-collisions because when you start moving right after some downs, the head might land on existing body segments.

Wait:

1. Move DOWN three times:2,8 â†’2,7â†’2,6â†’2,5

But from 2,5, can we move RIGHT four times? Let's see step by step:

- After three downs:
   - Head at (2,5)
   - Body is now [3,8;4,8] because each time moving down added the previous head to front and removed tail.

Wait no: After first movement down from 2,8â†’2,7:

Body becomes [(2,7)], as we saw earlier. Then second down would make it (2,6), but with body again only [2,6;2,7], then removing tail? So again only one segment.

This seems problematic because the snake is only a single segment after three downs, which might allow us to maneuver more freely.

Wait perhaps:

After moving down thrice, head at 2,5 and body being [(2,8), (3,8);4,8], but each movement down removes previous tail. So actually the body would be [2,7;3,8] after first move, then becomes [2,6;3,8] after second, etc.

Wait no: Each time we move down:

- Insert old head into front â†’ new list is current body + old head?
Wait perhaps not.

Actually this is getting too complicated to model step by step manually. Maybe it's better to accept that without proper tracking of each movement and the resulting snake body segments, determining a path is difficult.

Alternatively, think about what needs to be done: decrease y from 8â†’4 (i.e., move down four times), and increase x from2â†’4 (move right two times). But due to initial positions, moving right when at position (2,y) would lead into the body since one of the segments is at (3,y).

Thus, need a way to first turn around.

Wait, perhaps by moving DOWN several steps until reaching 2,5; then moving RIGHT twice without collision.

But from (2,5), can we move RIGHT two times?

From position:

- Current head:2,5

After moving right onceâ†’3,5. Is this in the body? The current body is [3,8;4,8], so noâ€”unless it's a previous segment.

Wait the initial segments are 3,8 and 4,8, which are in different rows than 3,5.

So from (2,5), moving right to 3,5: not occupied. So allowed.

Then again move rightâ†’4,5.

Now at position 4,5 with body:

After movement steps:

- Each time moved down and then right, the snake would have added a new head each step without affecting previous segments because they are in different rows or columns.

Thus, after moving from (2,8) down thrice to (2,5), then right twice to (4,5):

Total moves: 3+2=5.

But wait current position is at (4,5). Need to go further down two more times to reach y=4. So:

6. Move downâ†’(4,4)

7. Check for collision: no, because body is [3,8;4,8], so 4,4 is not in it.

Thus total of 5 moves? Wait movement sequence seems:

1. DOWN (2,8)â†’(2,7)
2. DOWN â†’(2,6)
3. DOWN â†’(2,5)
4. RIGHT â†’(3,5)
5. RIGHT â†’(4,5)
6. DOWN â†’(4,4)

But wait step 6 would require moving down from (4,5)â†’(4,4), which is the target.

So total of six moves?

Wait but in this plan:

- After three downs: head at (2,5); body segments are [3,8;4,8]. So when moving right twice after that, inserting old heads each time into front and removing tailâ€”probably no collisions. Then finally move down once.

Thus total number of moves is 6.

But wait in the initial step-by-step movement I considered:

After three downs: head at (2,5). Each of these steps added a single segment because snake body was collapsing due to self-insertion each time.

But perhaps that's not accurateâ€”each time moving down adds new head and removes tail, so when starting with two-body segments, after first down movement, the snake becomes three segments? Or is it only one?

Wait:

Each time you move in same direction (from initial LEFT), but insert old head into front each step.

Initial body: [3,8;4,8]

Step 1: Move down â†’ Insert (2,7) at front. New temporary list: [(2,7);3,8;4,8]. Then remove tail because not eating appleâ†’ new body is [(2,7)].

Thus after first move, the snake has only one segmentâ€”(2,7).

Second movement: Move down again â†’ Insert (2,6) at front. New temp list: [2,6; 2,7]. Since didn't eat apple, remove last elementâ†’ new body is [(2,6)].

Wait now it's a single segment. So moving right from here would mean inserting head into front of empty list?

No, perhaps when the snake has only one segment (i.e., no previous segments), then movement can be done without collision because there are no prior body parts to hit.

Thus, starting with:

1. Move down three times: each time reduces y by 1 and the snake's body is a single head.

After third move:
- Head at (2,5)
- Body as [(2,8);3,8;4,8] â†’ Wait no, initial movement steps may have different effects based on how body insertion works. Maybe after first down, the body only has one segment because self-insertion and deletion causes that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each movement step accurately:

Each time you move in same direction (left or right), you insert old head into front of current body, then remove last element if not eating apple.

So starting at (2,8):

Current head: 2,8

Body segments:3,8;4,8

Direction is LEFT.

Step 1:
- Move left â†’ new head at 1,8.
   - Insert old head (2,8) into front of current body [3,8;4,8] â†’ temp list becomes [2,8;3,8;4,8]
   - Since not eating apple, remove last element: new body is [2,8; 3,8]

But wait this seems inconsistentâ€”because after inserting head at front and removing tail (last), but the original body was two segments. So now with three segments:

[2,8;3,8]?

Wait no: Wait current movement results in new temporary list of length increased by one because we're adding a new segment.

So when you insert old head into front, then remove last element only if not eating apple, so:

- The body's length remains the same as it was before plus 1 (new inserted head) minus 0 (since no eating). So body grows? Or is this an illusion?

Wait perhaps snake's body consists of all the previous segments and the new head. When you move a step, inserting into front adds a segment, then removing tail may or may not change length.

Thus:

- Insert old head at front: increases body by one.
- Then remove last element (if no apple): decreases body by one.

So net effect is same as initial movement steps without changing the number of segments.

But in reality, this must be wrong because if you have a snake with N segments and move direction same, it would require that head moves into previous tail, but since they are moving forward, perhaps each step increases or decreases body size?

Wait now I'm confused again. Maybe another way: each movement appends the new head at front of list.

But after first move:

Old head is inserted into front of current body and then if not eating apple, last element (tail) is removed.

Thus, the net effect can be either same length or increase/decrease depending on operations.

Wait perhaps in this problem, moving in a direction without turning causes the snake to grow? Or no?

But since I'm stuck with tracking each step's exact body segments, maybe it's better to approach from another angle: planning the moves and assuming that self-collision won't happen due to direction changes.

Given all these complexities, perhaps the most straightforward answer is six moves:

1. DOWN

2. DOWN

3. DOWN â†’ now at (2,5)

4. RIGHT

5. RIGHT â†’ now facing east towards (4,5)

6. DOWN once more to reach 4,4 without collision.

But since this seems plausible but I'm unsure of the exact number, perhaps it's best to accept that the minimal path is six steps.
</think>

The apple is located at (4,4), which requires moving down from y=8 to y=4 and right from x=2 to x=4. Starting with two body parts in the same column, moving down four times allows the snake to navigate around its own body, then turning right twice, followed by another down move brings the head directly to (4,4). 

This results in a total of six moves.

$\boxed{6}$
