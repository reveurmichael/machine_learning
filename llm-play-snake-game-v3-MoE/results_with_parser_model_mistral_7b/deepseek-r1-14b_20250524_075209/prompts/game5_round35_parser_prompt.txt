<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get the snake from (5,0) to eat the apple at (4,1). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (5,0), and it's currently moving DOWN. The body cells are [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]. So the snake is a vertical line from (5,0) down to (5,6). Wait, no—actually, the head is at (5,0), and the body follows behind. The body list starts with (5,1), which is directly below the head. Then it goes up to (5,6), so the snake is actually extending upwards from the head. So the full snake is [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]. That's a pretty long snake.

The apple is at (4,1). So it's to the left of the head and one unit up. Let me visualize this:

- The grid is 10x10, with (0,0) being bottom-left and (9,9) top-right.
- Head is at (5,0), which is the fifth column from the left, first row (bottom).
- Apple is at (4,1), so one column to the left of the head and one row up.

The current direction is DOWN. So if the snake continues moving DOWN, it would go beyond the grid because y=0 is already the bottom. But that's a collision; it can't move DOWN anymore without dying.

I need to plan a path from (5,0) to (4,1). The Manhattan distance is |5-4| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2. So ideally, two moves: one LEFT and one UP. But I have to make sure that the snake can move without colliding with its body.

First, let's see if moving LEFT from (5,0) is possible. The current direction is DOWN, so the next move cannot be UP because of the no reverse rule. Wait, no—the current direction is DOWN, so the previous move was probably DOWN, but the next move can't be UP because it's reversing. So for the first move, since the current direction is DOWN, I can choose any direction except UP? Or wait, no—no, according to the movement rules, you cannot reverse. If current direction is "DOWN", you may not choose "UP" next. Similarly for LEFT/RIGHT.

Wait, the movement rules say: Cannot reverse—if current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN". So since the current direction is DOWN, I can't choose UP next. Wait, no—wait, the rule says that if the current direction is "UP", you cannot choose "DOWN" next. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So if current direction is DOWN, you cannot choose UP next.

Wait, let me check: Movement rules point 2 says:

"CANNOT REVERSE: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed."

So if the current direction is DOWN, then you cannot choose UP. So the next move can be LEFT or RIGHT, but not UP.

Wait, no—current direction is DOWN, so choosing UP would be a reverse. Because if you're moving down, then up is opposite.

Yes. So the snake is currently facing DOWN, so it cannot turn to UP in the next move. So from (5,0), possible first moves are LEFT or RIGHT or continue DOWN? Wait no—current direction is DOWN, meaning the last movement was downward. The next move can't be the reverse of that. So if current direction is DOWN, you can't choose UP.

Wait, but looking back at the example in Movement Update Rule 2: when moving from (4,4) with direction LEFT to new head (3,4). That suggests that movement continues in a certain direction until changed.

So in this case, since current direction is DOWN, and the first move cannot reverse. So first move can be any direction except UP. But wait, no—current direction is DOWN, so next move can't be UP.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about it more carefully. The initial movement direction is "DOWN", but if I choose a different direction, does that change the current direction for future moves?

Yes. For example, in the movement examples, when choosing LEFT from (4,4), the next head is (3,4) and the new direction would be LEFT.

So back to our case: current direction is DOWN. So for the first move, I can choose any direction except UP because that's reversing. Wait no—the rule says you cannot reverse on the same step. Wait, no—rule 2 says if current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next. Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT.

So in our case, current direction is DOWN, so we can't choose UP as the next move. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue moving DOWN?

Wait, wait—the movement rule says: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So for each pair of opposite directions, you can't switch between them. So if the snake is currently moving in a certain direction (e.g., DOWN), then the next move cannot be its reverse (UP).

So in this case, current direction is DOWN. So possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

Wait, but wait—what about continuing in the same direction? Because sometimes you can move straight ahead without changing direction. For example, if you're moving RIGHT and choose to continue moving RIGHT, that's allowed because it's not a reverse. But if you're moving RIGHT and then switch to LEFT, that's a reverse and not allowed.

So yes, for the next move, from DOWN, I can't choose UP. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN?

Wait no—because current direction is DOWN, so choosing to continue moving DOWN would mean moving in the same direction, which is allowed because it's not a reversal. But wait, how does that work with the grid? From (5,0), moving DOWN would take it to (5,-1), which is outside the grid and would cause death.

Wait no—the movement rules say: "If new_head is outside grid bounds [...] snake dies." So from (5,0), moving DOWN would be y= -1, which is invalid. So that's a collision and death. Therefore, moving DOWN is not an option because it leads to death. So the first move must be either LEFT or RIGHT.

So possible initial moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

Looking at the apple position (4,1), which is one unit left and one unit up from the head (5,0). So the ideal path would be to move LEFT then UP. But I need to check if that's safe.

But let's see: first move is LEFT to (4,0). Then next move is UP to (4,1), which is the apple.

So in two moves: LEFT then UP.

Now, I need to make sure this path doesn't cause any collisions with the body.

First, let's think about moving LEFT:

Current head is at (5,0). The body is [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]. So after moving LEFT to (4,0), the new head is (4,0).

But wait—the current direction is DOWN. So can I choose to move LEFT? Because according to movement rules, since current direction is DOWN, next move cannot be UP. But LEFT is allowed.

So first move: LEFT from (5,0) to (4,0). Now, check for collisions:

- New head is (4,0).
- Check if it's in any of the body cells except possibly the tail when moving.

The body cells are [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]. So none of these are at (4,0). Also, the new head is within grid bounds. So this move is safe.

After moving LEFT:

- The body updates by inserting the old head (5,0) at the front of the body list, making it [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), ..., (5,6)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, the tail is removed. So the new body becomes [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)].

So now, the snake's head is at (4,0), and the body is from (5,0) down to (5,5). The tail is at (5,5).

Next move: UP from (4,0) to (4,1). Let's check for collisions.

- New head would be (4,1).
- Check against body cells after first move. The new body is [(4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]. Wait no—the body is updated as follows:

Wait, the initial body list is [(5,1), ...]. After moving LEFT:

- The new head is (4,0). The old head was (5,0).

The update step after moving LEFT would be:

a. Insert old head (5,0) at front of body → body becomes [(5,0)] + [ (5,1), (5,2), ..., (5,6) ].

b. Since the new head is not at the apple position (which is 4,1), we didn't eat it, so remove the tail. The tail was (5,6) before moving, but after inserting old head and adding new head, the body is now [(5,0)] + original body except last element.

Wait no—let me think again.

Original body before first move: [ (5,1), (5,2), ..., (5,6) ].

After moving LEFT to (4,0):

a. Insert old head (5,0) at front → new body list is [(5,0)] + [ (5,1), (5,2), ..., (5,6) ] → but then, since we didn't eat the apple, remove the tail.

Wait no—step a and b are:

a. Insert old head into the front of the body list.

b. If not eating apple, remove last cell from the body.

So in this case, after moving LEFT to (4,0), the body becomes [(5,0)] + original body cells → but then since we didn't eat apple, we remove the last cell, which was (5,6).

Wait no—original body is [ (5,1), (5,2), ..., (5,6) ].

After inserting old head (5,0), the new list is [(5,0)] + [ (5,1), (5,2), ..., (5,6) ] → length 7.

Then, since we didn't eat apple, we remove last cell: so body becomes [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)].

So the body after first move is from (5,0) to (5,5).

Now, moving UP from (4,0) to (4,1):

Check if new head (4,1) collides with any body cell except possibly the tail when moving.

The body cells are [(5,0), (5,1), ..., (5,5)]. None of these are at (4,1). Also, apple is at (4,1), so we eat it. So after this move:

- New head is (4,1).

- Update body: insert old head (4,0) into front → [(4,0)] + [ (5,0), (5,1), ..., (5,5) ].

- Since we ate the apple, we don't remove any cells. So new body becomes [(4,0), (5,0), (5,1), ..., (5,5)], which is length 7 now.

So no collision occurs because none of the body cells are at (4,1).

Thus, moving LEFT then UP would allow the snake to reach the apple without colliding with its own body.

But wait—what about the next move after eating the apple? The direction changes to UP. Then, is there any risk in future moves?

Well, the problem only asks for the path from (5,0) to (4,1), so perhaps that's sufficient.

Therefore, the sequence would be:

First move: LEFT → (4,0).

Second move: UP → (4,1), eating the apple.

This seems safe.

But wait—after moving LEFT and then UP, what is the new direction? After moving LEFT, the direction becomes LEFT. Then, moving UP would change the direction to UP. So that's allowed because each move changes the direction unless you continue in the same direction.

Wait, no—the movement direction only changes if you choose a different direction; otherwise, it stays the same.

So after first move LEFT from DOWN (direction changes to LEFT), next move is UP, which is a change of direction. Since current direction was LEFT, moving to UP is allowed because LEFT and UP are not reverses.

Yes, that's fine.

But let me make sure there's no collision in the second move:

After first move, head is at (4,0). The body is [(5,0), (5,1), ..., (5,5)].

When moving UP from (4,0) to (4,1):

- New head is (4,1).

- Check against body cells after first move: [ (5,0), (5,1), ..., (5,5) ] → none are at (4,1).

Thus, no collision.

Therefore, the path of LEFT then UP would work.

But wait—another consideration: when moving to (4,0), which is directly left of (5,0), and considering that the body was previously in a vertical line from (5,0) down. So after moving LEFT, the body becomes [(5,0)] followed by [ (5,1), ..., (5,5) ].

So no part of the body is at (4,0) except possibly if there's any overlapping.

Wait, but in the first move, the new head is (4,0). The old head was (5,0), which becomes the next cell in the body. So after moving LEFT, the body starts with (5,0), then comes (5,1), etc., none of which are at (4,0).

Thus, no collision.

Therefore, the two moves: LEFT and UP would successfully allow the snake to reach the apple without dying.

Alternatively, could there be another path? For example, moving DOWN is invalid as it causes death. Moving RIGHT would take the head further away from the apple, so that's not efficient. So LEFT then UP seems optimal.

Another consideration: when eating the apple, the body length increases by one. Wait no—when you eat the apple, you don't remove the tail, so the snake grows longer.

Wait, in the update rule:

- After moving, insert old head into front of body list.

- If new head is on an apple (i.e., at (4,1)), do not remove last cell. So body length increases by one.

Thus, after eating the apple, the body becomes longer.

But since we only have to reach the apple once, it's okay. No need to worry about future moves as per the problem statement.

So conclusion: The snake can move LEFT then UP to reach the apple without colliding with its own body.
</think>

The snake should first move LEFT from (5,0) to (4,0), then move UP to (4,1). This path avoids collisions and allows it to eat the apple.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Current Position and Direction**: The snake's head is at (5,0), moving DOWN. Its body extends vertically from (5,1) upwards to (5,6).

2. **Possible First Moves**: From DOWN direction, cannot move UP next due to no-reverse rule. Thus, possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT.

3. **Optimal Path Choice**:
   - Moving LEFT to (4,0): This is the shortest path towards the apple at (4,1).
   
4. **First Move Execution**:
   - Move LEFT from (5,0) to (4,0).
   - Check for collision: No body cells are at (4,0). Safe.
   - Update body by inserting old head (5,0) and removing tail (since no apple eaten yet).

5. **Second Move Execution**:
   - From (4,0), move UP to (4,1).
   - Check for collision: No body cells are at (4,1). Safe.
   - Eat the apple; do not remove tail, so body length increases.

**Answer**: The snake should first move LEFT then UP. 

\boxed{LEFT \rightarrow UP}
