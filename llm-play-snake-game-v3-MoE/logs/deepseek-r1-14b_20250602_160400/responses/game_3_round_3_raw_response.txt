========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this Snake problem. So, the snake is at (4,7), and the apple is at (7,2). The current direction is "UP", which means if I don't change direction, the next move will be up. But wait, according to the rules, I can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is UP, I can't go DOWN next. So, my first move options are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue going UP.

Looking at the body cells: [(4,6), (4,5)]. The head is at (4,7). So, the snake's body goes from (4,6) to (4,5), meaning it's a vertical line downwards from the head. If I move UP, the new head would be (4,8), which is within bounds because y can go up to 9. But I need to check if moving UP is safe.

Wait, the current direction is UP, so if I choose UP again, that's allowed. Let me see where the snake is. The body after the head is at (4,6) and (4,5). So, from the head at (4,7), moving up would go to (4,8). Now, checking for collisions: the new head shouldn't collide with any body except possibly the tail when it moves.

But in this case, since I'm moving UP, the body will shift. The old head (4,7) becomes part of the body. So, after moving UP, the new body would be [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]. Then, if we didn't eat an apple, we'd remove the tail (4,5), so the body remains as [(4,7), (4,6)].

But wait, the apple is at (7,2), which is far away. So moving UP might not be the most direct path, but I have to consider the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT would be better because the apple is to the right and down. Let's see: if I move RIGHT from (4,7) to (5,7). But wait, the current direction is UP, so can I change direction? Yes, except for reversing. So LEFT or RIGHT are possible.

But let me think about the movement rules again. The snake cannot reverse its direction on the first move. Since the current direction is UP, I can't go DOWN next. So from UP, allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

Wait, no—actually, the "first move" refers to any initial change in direction after NONE, but in this case, the current direction isn't NONE. So, when you're currently moving in a direction, you can't reverse on the next move. So from UP, I can go LEFT or RIGHT, but not DOWN.

So for the first move, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue with UP.

If I choose to go RIGHT, then the head moves to (5,7). Now, checking for collisions: is this cell occupied by any body segments? The current body is [(4,6), (4,5)], so no. So that's safe.

After moving RIGHT, the new head is (5,7). Then, the old head (4,7) becomes part of the body. Now, since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (4,5), making the body [(4,6), (4,7)]. Wait no—body is updated by inserting the old head at the front, so the new body would be [old_head] + current_body. So after moving RIGHT, the body becomes [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5)] before removing the tail if we didn't eat an apple.

Wait, let me clarify the update steps:

After computing new_head and ensuring no collision, step 3 is to update the body:

a. Insert old head at front of BODY list.

b. If new_head == apple position, grow (don't remove tail). Otherwise, remove last element (tail) so length remains same.

So in this case, since we're not eating an apple, after moving RIGHT, the body becomes [old_head] + current_body = [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5)], and then we remove the tail (4,5), resulting in [(4,7), (4,6)].

So the new snake is head at (5,7), body at (4,7) and (4,6).

Now, I need to plan a path from (5,7) towards (7,2). The apple is two cells down and three to the right. But I have to manage the body so that it doesn't block my way.

Alternatively, maybe moving UP first would be better. Let me see:

If I move UP, new head is (4,8). Body becomes [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5)], then remove tail if no apple eaten. So body becomes [(4,7), (4,6)].

From there, the next moves can be towards the apple.

But I'm not sure yet. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the Manhattan distance and see the required moves.

The head needs to move 3 units right and 5 units down. So total of 8 steps: 3 rights and 5 downs in some order.

Now, considering that each move can't reverse direction immediately.

Wait, but moving right from (4,7) would take me towards x=7, which is the apple's x-coordinate.

But I need to make sure that after each move, the body doesn't block my path. For example, if I move right, then down, etc., without getting trapped.

Another consideration: when eating the apple, the snake grows, so after eating, it must have at least one legal move next turn to avoid being trapped.

So let's outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT from (4,7) → (5,7). Check for collisions—safe.
2. Then, move DOWN to (5,6), then again DOWN to (5,5), and so on until reaching y=2.
3. But I have to make sure that the body doesn't block my path as it grows.

Alternatively, perhaps moving UP first to create space above, but since the apple is below, maybe not necessary.

Wait, let me think about possible collision points.

If I move right three times: (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). Then, from there, move down 5 steps to (7,2).

But I have to ensure that after each move, the new head doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail's position.

Wait, but when moving towards the apple, the body is following. So if I make a series of right moves and then down, I need to make sure that the body doesn't get in the way as it follows.

Alternatively, perhaps moving straight down would be better, but current direction is UP, so first move can't be DOWN. Wait, no—the current direction is UP, so on the first move, you can choose any direction except DOWN. So from (4,7), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

Wait, that's a key point. Since the current direction is UP, my next move cannot be DOWN. So I have to make sure that in my path planning, I don't require moving DOWN immediately after UP.

So for the first move, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or stay UP.

If I go RIGHT, then from (5,7), I could proceed to move DOWN towards (7,2).

But wait, from (5,7), if I move down, that would be against the previous direction of UP. Wait no—the current direction after moving RIGHT would change. Each move changes the direction.

Wait, in each step, the snake's direction is determined by the move chosen. So if I choose to move RIGHT, then my new direction becomes RIGHT for the next step.

So perhaps a path like:

1. Move RIGHT → (5,7), direction now RIGHT.
2. Then, check if moving DOWN is allowed next (since previous direction was RIGHT, so next can be UP or DOWN or LEFT, but not RIGHT again—wait no, you can't reverse directions, meaning that from RIGHT, you can go UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT?

Wait, the movement rules say: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is "UP", may not choose "DOWN". Similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So from RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT.

So after moving RIGHT once, next moves can't be LEFT; they can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

But in this case, we need to go DOWN towards the apple's y-coordinate (which is lower). So perhaps:

1. Move RIGHT → (5,7), direction: RIGHT.
2. Then move DOWN → (5,6), direction: DOWN.
3. Continue moving DOWN until reaching y=2.

Wait, but from (5,7) to (5,6) is safe as long as those cells aren't occupied by the body.

But after each move, the body shifts and may occupy previous positions.

Let me try to map this out step by step.

Initial state:

- Head: (4,7)
- Direction: UP
- Body: [(4,6), (4,5)]

First move options: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

Option 1: Move RIGHT to (5,7).

After moving:

- New head: (5,7)
- Body becomes [old_head=(4,7)] + current_body = [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]
- Since we didn't eat an apple, remove tail → body is [(4,7), (4,6)]

So the snake is now:

Head: (5,7)
Body: (4,7) and (4,6)

Next move options from direction RIGHT can be UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.

But wait, after moving RIGHT once, the new direction is RIGHT, so next moves cannot be LEFT.

Our target is (7,2), which requires moving right twice more (from 5 to 7) and down five times (from 7 to 2).

So perhaps:

1. Move RIGHT → (5,7)
2. Then move DOWN → (5,6)
3. Then move DOWN → (5,5)
4. Then move DOWN → (5,4)
5. Then move DOWN → (5,3)
6. Then move DOWN → (5,2)
7. Now we need to go right twice more.

Wait, but at step 6, head is at (5,2). From there, moving RIGHT would take us to (6,2), then (7,2).

But let's see if that's feasible without collision.

After each move, the body follows, so I have to make sure that the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body except possibly the tail when it moves.

Let me try to simulate this:

Move 1: RIGHT

Head: (5,7)
Body: [(4,7), (4,6)]

No collision.

Move 2: DOWN

Head: (5,6)
Body: [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)] → remove tail (4,6) since no apple eaten. So body is [(5,7), (4,7)].

Wait, but step 3a says insert old head at front of BODY list. Wait, in move 2, the previous head was (5,7). After moving DOWN to (5,6), the new body becomes [old_head=(5,7)] + current_body [(4,7), (4,6)] → so [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]. Then since no apple eaten, remove tail (4,6) → body is [(5,7), (4,7)].

So after move 2:

Head: (5,6)
Body: (5,7) and (4,7)

Move 3: DOWN to (5,5). Check collision—body segments are (5,7), (4,7). So new head is at (5,5), which isn't in the body except for (4,7) if we have a diagonal? No, it's straight down.

Wait, no, because the body is [(5,7), (4,7)], so from (5,6), moving DOWN to (5,5):

- New head: (5,5)
- Body becomes [old_head=(5,6)] + current_body = [(5,6), (4,7)]
- Remove tail (since no apple) → body is [(5,6), (4,7)]

So new snake:

Head: (5,5)
Body: (5,6) and (4,7)

Wait, this seems a bit scattered. Maybe moving in straight lines isn't the best approach because the body could end up blocking.

Alternatively, perhaps making a U-turn to face downward would be better, but given the movement constraints, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe first move UP once to create space above, then proceed right and down. Let me try that.

Move 1: UP → (4,8)

Body after:

- Insert old_head=(4,7) into body [(4,6), (4,5)] → becomes [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]
- Remove tail if no apple eaten → body is [(4,7), (4,6)]

So snake is:

Head: (4,8)
Body: (4,7) and (4,6)

Then, move RIGHT to (5,8). But wait, the current direction after moving UP is now UP. Wait no—each move changes the direction. So initial direction was UP; first move is UP again, so direction remains UP.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to simulate each possible first move and see which one leads to a collision-free path.

Alternatively, let's consider that moving RIGHT from (4,7) may be safer because the apple is in that general direction.

After move 1: RIGHT → (5,7), body becomes [(4,7), (4,6)]

Move 2: DOWN → (5,6). Body becomes [(5,7), (4,7)]

But wait, from (5,6), moving down to (5,5) would have the head at (5,5) and body at (5,7), (4,7). That seems okay.

Move 3: DOWN → (5,4)

Body becomes [(5,6), (4,7)]

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again about how the body updates.

After each move:

1. Move RIGHT to (5,7):

   - New head: (5,7)
   - Body after insertion: [old_head=(4,7)] + current_body = [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]
   - Remove tail → body is [(4,7), (4,6)]

2. Move DOWN to (5,6):

   - New head: (5,6)
   - Body after insertion: [old_head=(5,7)] + current_body = [(5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]
   - Remove tail → body is [(5,7), (4,7)]

3. Move DOWN to (5,5):

   - New head: (5,5)
   - Body after insertion: [old_head=(5,6)] + current_body = [(5,6), (4,7)]
   - Remove tail → body is [(5,6), (4,7)]

Now, the head is at (5,5), and the body is at (5,6) and (4,7). So when moving further down:

Move 4: DOWN to (5,4)

- New head: (5,4)
- Body after insertion: [old_head=(5,5)] + current_body = [(5,5), (5,6), (4,7)]
- Remove tail → body is [(5,5), (5,6)]

Move 5: DOWN to (5,3)

- New head: (5,3)
- Body after insertion: [old_head=(5,4)] + current_body = [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]
- Remove tail → body is [(5,4), (5,5)]

Move 6: DOWN to (5,2)

- New head: (5,2)
- Body after insertion: [old_head=(5,3)] + current_body = [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]
- Remove tail → body is [(5,3), (5,4)]

Now, from (5,2), we need to move right twice.

Move 7: RIGHT to (6,2)

- New head: (6,2)
- Body after insertion: [old_head=(5,2)] + current_body = [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]
- Remove tail → body is [(5,2), (5,3)]

Move 8: RIGHT to (7,2)

- New head: (7,2)
- Body after insertion: [old_head=(6,2)] + current_body = [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3)]
- Remove tail → body is [(6,2), (5,2)]

So in this path, the snake successfully reaches the apple at (7,2) without colliding with its own body. That seems feasible.

But I have to make sure that all intermediate steps are collision-free.

Wait, when moving from (5,5) to (5,4), is the head at (5,4) colliding with any part of the body? The body after move 3 was [(5,6), (4,7)]. So (5,4) isn't in the body. Similarly for other steps.

Yes, this path works.

So the moves would be:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN
7. RIGHT
8. RIGHT

Wait, but wait—after moving down from (5,7) to (5,6), then again to (5,5), etc., that's six moves down. Wait, from y=7 to y=2 is 5 steps down: 7→6→5→4→3→2.

So the sequence would be:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN
7. RIGHT
8. RIGHT

But that's eight moves in total, which makes sense because we need 3 rights and 5 downs, but since direction changes can't be reversed immediately, the path requires some maneuvering.

Wait no, actually, from (5,7) to (7,2), you need two rights and five downs. But arranging them without having to reverse directions may require additional steps because after moving right, you can't move left next.

But in this case, the first move is RIGHT, then six DOWNs, but that would only get us to (5,2). Then two more RIGHTS to reach (7,2).

Wait, but as I simulated earlier, yes, it works.

Alternatively, perhaps a shorter path exists. Let me think.

Another approach: after moving RIGHT once, move DOWN five times, then RIGHT twice.

But that requires making sure the body doesn't block the way.

From (5,7):

1. RIGHT → (5,7), body [(4,7), (4,6)]
2. DOWN → (5,6), body [(5,7), (4,7)]
3. DOWN → (5,5), body [(5,6), (4,7)]
4. DOWN → (5,4), body [(5,5), (5,6)]
5. DOWN → (5,3), body [(5,4), (5,5)]
6. DOWN → (5,2), body [(5,3), (5,4)]
Then move RIGHT twice.

So that's the same as before.

Therefore, the path is feasible without collision.

Thus, the answer would be to first move RIGHT, then DOWN five times, then RIGHT twice.

But wait, in terms of moves, each step is a single direction change. So after moving RIGHT once, you can't move LEFT next. But since we're only moving DOWN and RIGHT, that's okay.

So the sequence is:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN
6. DOWN
7. RIGHT
8. RIGHT

Thus, eight moves in total to reach (7,2).

But perhaps there's a shorter way by making a different initial move.

Alternatively, another possible first move is UP, then proceed right and down.

Let me try that.

Move 1: UP → (4,8), body [(4,7), (4,6)]

Then:

Move 2: RIGHT → (5,8), body [(4,8), (4,7)]

But wait, moving from (4,8) to (5,8):

- New head: (5,8)
- Body after insertion: [old_head=(4,8)] + current_body = [(4,8), (4,7)]
- Remove tail → body is [(4,8), (4,7)]

Now, moving down from (5,8) to (5,7):

Move 3: DOWN

But that would take us back towards the original position. It might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to go right first as in the previous plan.

Therefore, I think the optimal path is:

RIGHT → DOWN ×5 → RIGHT ×2

So eight moves in total.
</think>

The snake can reach the target by moving right once, then down five times, and finally right twice more without colliding with its body. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Move RIGHT**: The head moves from (4,7) to (5,7). The body updates to [(4,7), (4,6)].
2. **Move DOWN five times**:
   - From (5,7) → (5,6)
   - From (5,6) → (5,5)
   - From (5,5) → (5,4)
   - From (5,4) → (5,3)
   - From (5,3) → (5,2)
3. **Move RIGHT twice**:
   - From (5,2) → (6,2)
   - From (6,2) → (7,2)

Each move updates the body by inserting the new head position and removing the tail if no food is eaten.

Final answer: \boxed{\text{RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT}}
