========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem where I need to find a safe path for my snake in the classic Snake game so that it can eat an apple located at (2,2) starting from the head position (5,5). Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the given information and the requirements. The snake is on a 10x10 grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. The head position is (5,5), which means it's somewhere in the middle of the grid. The apple is at (2,2), which is closer to the origin.

The snake's body cells are given as an ordered list starting from behind the head to the tail. For example, if the body is [(4,4), (4,3), ...], each consecutive pair must be adjacent either horizontally or vertically. The movement rules are a bit complex, so I need to make sure I follow them correctly.

The main goal is to plan a sequence of moves that will get the snake's head from (5,5) to (2,2). The path must avoid collisions and ensure that after each move, the next position is valid. Also, if the snake eats the apple, it should not trap itself immediately in the next step.

Let me start by visualizing the grid. The head is at (5,5), which is near the top-right corner of the grid. The apple is at (2,2), which is closer to the bottom-left corner. So, perhaps moving towards reducing x and y coordinates from 5,5 would be a good strategy.

The snake's movement rules mention that the direction can't reverse on the first move if it's not "NONE". Wait, no—the rule says: "Valid directions: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed. Also, cannot reverse direction on the first move." Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify that.

Wait, maybe the rule means that if you choose a new direction after having moved in another direction (except NONE), you can't reverse. For example, if the snake was moving "UP" and now chooses "DOWN", it's not allowed unless it's the first move. Or perhaps it's about not reversing direction on subsequent moves.

But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's focus on the given steps and rules.

The movement update rule says that after computing the new head position, we need to check if it's outside bounds or collides with any body segment except the tail when moving. Also, if the new head is the same as the apple's position, then we grow the body by adding the new head without removing the tail.

I think a good approach is to model the snake's movement step by step, starting from the initial state and trying different directions until reaching (2,2).

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initial state: Head at (5,5), Body cells are given as an ordered list excluding head. Wait, but in the problem statement, the body cells are provided as a list, so perhaps I need to use them to determine possible moves.

Wait, no—the initial problem states that the snake's body is given as an ordered list of positions from behind the head to the tail. So perhaps for each step, we can model how the body changes based on direction and whether collisions are avoided.

But perhaps it's easier to start by considering the movement from (5,5) towards the apple at (2,2). Since moving left or up could bring us closer.

Let me think about possible directions. From (5,5), possible initial moves could be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But let's check which ones are valid without causing immediate collisions.

If I choose to move LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5). Then the new head is at (4,5). Now, we need to ensure that this position doesn't have any body segments except perhaps the tail when moving.

But wait, perhaps it's better to simulate each step carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible moves from the initial state and find the shortest path to the apple. However, since the problem requires us to output a specific JSON with the directions, perhaps we need to plan the steps manually.

But perhaps there's a more straightforward way. Let's consider that moving towards the apple as much as possible is the key. From (5,5) to (2,2), the movement would involve reducing x and y coordinates.

Let me calculate the required direction changes:

From (5,5) to (2,2):

Change in x: 5-2=3 steps left.
Change in y:5-2=3 steps down.

So perhaps moving diagonally isn't possible since each move is either horizontal or vertical. So we need a combination of moves that reduce both x and y by certain amounts.

But since the snake can only move one cell at a time, perhaps the path would involve moving left and up alternately or some other pattern.

Alternatively, let's consider the given example in movement rules where choosing "LEFT" from (5,5) results in new_head=(4,5). Then we check if that position is valid.

But perhaps I need to find a sequence of moves starting from (5,5) and moving towards (2,2).

Let me outline possible initial moves:

Option 1: Move Left to (4,5)
- Check if this is allowed. Since the snake's body doesn't include (4,5) as it's the new head.

But perhaps I need to consider the entire body structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for a path that reduces x and y coordinates each time, ensuring that we don't collide with any body segments.

Let me try moving in the direction that brings us closer to (2,2). Since (5,5) is further away from (2,2), perhaps moving towards decreasing x and y would be better.

But let's consider possible steps:

1. Start at (5,5).
2. Choose a direction that gets closer to (2,2).

Possible directions: LEFT or DOWN.

Let me try choosing "DOWN" first. Wait, but from (5,5), moving down would take us outside the grid if we go beyond y=9? No, because y starts at 0. So from (5,5) moving DOWN would take us to (5,-1), which is invalid. So perhaps that's not a good move.

Alternatively, moving LEFT or RIGHT could be better.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the given example where choosing "LEFT" from (4,4) leads to certain results. But in our case, starting from (5,5), maybe moving LEFT first would take us to (4,5). Then we can check if that's allowed.

But perhaps it's better to create a step-by-step plan:

1. From (5,5), choose a direction.
2. Compute new_head based on direction.
3. Check if new_head is outside grid or collides with any body segment except the tail when moving.
4. If not, proceed and update the body accordingly.

But perhaps this is getting too complex without seeing the exact initial body structure. Since the problem states that the body cells are given as an ordered list excluding the head, perhaps we can assume a certain pattern or find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the snake's body is such that each segment is adjacent, so perhaps moving in a straight line towards the apple would be possible if there's enough space.

But perhaps the key here is to realize that from (5,5) to (2,2), we need to move 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So maybe choosing directions that reduce x by one each time and y by one each time could work.

Let me outline a possible path:

Move Left: From (5,5) → (4,5)
Check if this is allowed. Since the body doesn't include (4,5) yet, perhaps it's okay.
Then move Left again to (3,5), but wait, that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a spiral or other pattern towards the apple.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to realize that from (5,5), we can move left three times and down three times, but considering the grid boundaries.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each step reduces either x or y by 1. So starting at (5,5):

Move Left → (4,5)
Then Move Right is not allowed since it would go beyond, so maybe move Down → (5,4), then Left again?

But perhaps this is getting too convoluted without the exact body structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal path involves moving towards the apple in a way that doesn't block itself immediately. Since after eating the apple, the snake must not trap itself.

Given that the problem requires us to output a JSON with the moves, perhaps we can assume that the movement is possible and find a sequence of directions.

Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. From (5,5), move LEFT three times to reach x=2, y=5.
But wait, let's see: starting at (5,5).

Move Left → (4,5)
Check if this is allowed. Since the body doesn't include (4,5) yet.

Then again Move Left → (3,5)
Again, same.

After three Moves LEFT, we reach x=2, y=5.

But then from there, moving DOWN to reach y=2 would take us closer.

So perhaps:

From (2,5), move DOWN → (2,4)
Check if this is allowed. The new head at (2,4) should not be in the body segments except when that tail moves.

But perhaps this is getting too detailed without seeing the exact initial body structure.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to realize that from (5,5), moving DOWN three times would take us to y=2, but we need to adjust x as well.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that each step reduces either x or y by 1 until reaching (2,2).

But given the complexity, perhaps I should look for a pattern where the snake moves in such a way that after eating the apple, it doesn't trap itself.

Alternatively, perhaps moving towards decreasing x and y coordinates as much as possible is the way to go.

Given all this, perhaps the optimal path involves moving LEFT three times and DOWN three times. But considering the initial position at (5,5), let's try:

Move LEFT → (4,5)
Check if this is allowed. If body doesn't include it yet, proceed.
Then again LEFT → (3,5)
Again LEFT → (2,5)

Now, from (2,5), move DOWN → (2,4)
But perhaps we need to adjust x as well.

Alternatively, perhaps moving diagonally isn't possible since each move is either horizontal or vertical. So maybe a better approach is to consider that the path requires certain moves.

Given that the problem requires us to output the directions, perhaps I can assume that the movement is possible and find a sequence of three LEFT and three DOWN moves, but adjusted for direction.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to realize that from (5,5), moving LEFT twice and then DOWN once would take us closer. But without knowing the exact body structure, this is speculative.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to outline a possible sequence of moves and see if they can reach (2,2) without causing collisions or traps.

But perhaps in the context of the problem, it's better to realize that from (5,5), moving DOWN three times would take us down to y=2, but we need to adjust x as well. Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT and DOWN alternately.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that each step reduces either x or y by 1 until reaching (2,2). Thus, the path could be:

(5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (2,3) → (2,2)

But this would require moving DOWN from y=5 to y=2. However, perhaps each move needs to be checked for collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

(5,5) → (4,5) → (4,4) → ... but without knowing the body structure, it's hard to say.

Given that this problem requires a specific answer, perhaps I can consider that from (5,5), moving DOWN three times and LEFT three times would reach (2,2). But let's see:

From (5,5):

1. DOWN → (5,4)
Check if allowed.
Body doesn't include (5,4) yet.

2. DOWN → (5,3)
Again, check.

3. DOWN → (5,2)

But now x is still 5, which isn't getting us closer to y=2.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT first:

1. LEFT → (4,5)
Check.

2. LEFT → (3,5)

3. LEFT → (2,5)

Now from (2,5):

4. DOWN → (2,4)

Check if allowed.

5. DOWN → (2,3)

6. DOWN → (2,2) - success!

So the sequence would be: DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

But let's verify each step:

Starting at (5,5).

1. Choose DOWN to (5,4). Check for collisions: body doesn't include this segment yet, so it's allowed.
Body becomes [(5,4)] except wait—the initial body is given as a list excluding the head. So perhaps in this case, after moving DOWN from (5,5) to (5,4), we need to check if (5,4) is in any body segments.

But since the body starts with only (5,5), and then when we choose directions, each move adds a new segment except for the tail. Wait, perhaps this approach isn't correct without knowing the exact initial body structure.

Given that I'm stuck on the exact initial body cells, perhaps it's better to consider another approach.

Since the problem requires us to output a specific JSON with moves from (5,5) towards (2,2), perhaps we can assume that moving DOWN three times and LEFT three times would get us there. But let's see:

From (5,5):

1. Move DOWN → (5,4)
Check if this is allowed.

But perhaps the body doesn't include this position yet, so it's okay.

Then again DOWN to (5,3), then (5,2).

Now from x=5, moving left each time would take us to x=4, 3, etc., but we need to reach x=2. So that approach may not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is:

From (5,5):

1. Move LEFT → (4,5)
Check if allowed.

Then again LEFT → (3,5)

Again LEFT → (2,5)

Now from (2,5), move DOWN → (2,4)

Check for collisions: body doesn't have this yet.

Move DOWN to (2,3)

Move DOWN to (2,2) - success!

Thus, the sequence would be:

LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN.

But let's count the moves. That's five moves. But perhaps in reality, we can reach earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient path exists by moving DOWN three times first and then LEFT twice.

From (5,5):

1. DOWN → (5,4)
Check allowed.

2. DOWN → (5,3)

3. DOWN → (5,2)

Now from x=5, we need to move left twice:

4. LEFT → (4,2) - perhaps this is allowed?

But then check if that's on any body segments except when moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path requires fewer moves.

Given the complexity and without the exact initial body structure, it's challenging to determine the exact sequence of moves. However, based on typical snake movement patterns towards a target, I might infer that the solution involves moving DOWN three times and LEFT three times in some order.

But considering the problem statement again, perhaps the key is that from (5,5), moving DOWN three times would take us down to y=2 without affecting x. But then we need to adjust x.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to realize that each move towards reducing either x or y decreases by one until reaching the target.

Thus, perhaps the solution involves moving DOWN three times and LEFT three times in some order to reach (2,2). However, since I'm not certain about the exact body structure, this might be an educated guess.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps it's better to outline a possible sequence of moves based on typical snake movement strategies towards the target.

Thus, my tentative answer is:

The snake should move DOWN three times and LEFT three times in some order. For example:

Down, Down, Left, Down, Left, Left

But without knowing the exact body structure, this might not be accurate. However, perhaps the correct sequence involves moving DOWN to get closer to y=2 first.

Thus, I will proceed with writing a possible move sequence that could lead from (5,5) towards (2,2).
</think>

Now, let's formalize the thought process into a structured answer:

The problem requires determining the sequence of moves for the snake's head to travel from position (5,5) to (2,2). The movement must avoid collisions and ensure that after each move, the next position is valid. 

Given the initial position and target, the optimal strategy involves moving downwards first to reduce y-coordinate closer to 2, then leftwards to adjust x as needed.

The sequence of moves could be:

1. DOWN
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. LEFT
5. LEFT

This results in the head moving from (5,5) to (5,2), then further down and leftward towards (2,2).

However, without precise information about the snake's body structure, this may not be accurate. A more optimized path might involve combining DOWN and LEFT moves in a specific order.

Final Answer:
The snake should move DOWN three times followed by LEFT three times to reach the apple at (2,2). Thus, the sequence is:

\boxed{[ \text{DOWN}, \text{DOWN}, \text{DOWN}, \text{LEFT}, \text{LEFT} ]}

(Note: This assumes a specific body structure and path; actual moves may vary.)
