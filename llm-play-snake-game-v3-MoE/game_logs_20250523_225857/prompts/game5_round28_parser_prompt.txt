Okay, I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake needs to move from (3,6) to eat the apple at (7,2). Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (3,6), and the body segments are [(2,6), (2,5), (1,5)]. So the snake's body is extending from (3,6) through these points, making it a bit coiled.

The apple is at (7,2). To reach there, the head needs to move right 4 times and down 4 times. But I also need to ensure that the snake doesn't collide with itself or go out of bounds.

Looking at the current direction, it's "RIGHT". That means initially, the next move should be either "RIGHT", "DOWN", or any if it's the first move, but since direction is set, we can only choose directions allowed by the movement rules. Since the current direction is "RIGHT", the snake cannot reverse and choose "LEFT" next.

Now, considering Manhattan distance, the shortest path would involve moving right and down, but I have to make sure that each move doesn't cause a collision. The body segments are currently at (2,6), (2,5), (1,5). So if the snake moves right again, it will go from (3,6) to (4,6). That's safe because there's no body segment there yet.

Next, I need to plan a path that avoids these body segments and the walls. Each move should keep the head within the grid and not overlap with any body part except possibly when growing after eating the apple.

I think starting by moving right as much as possible is a good idea because the apple is to the right of the current position. So, moving right from (3,6) to (4,6), then to (5,6), and so on until reaching (7,6). But I need to check if that's feasible without colliding with the body.

Wait, but when the snake moves, each body segment follows the head. So after moving right a few times, the body will start shifting accordingly. I also need to ensure that the tail doesn't get stuck or cause a collision.

Another consideration is eating the apple. When the head reaches (7,2), it should check if that's where the apple is. If so, the snake grows by one segment, which means the tail stays in place, and the body length increases. This allows the snake to keep moving forward more easily.

I should also avoid reversing direction without a valid reason. Since the initial direction is "RIGHT", I can't immediately turn left unless it's necessary for avoiding collisions or getting to the apple safely.

Looking at the current body segments, they are positioned from (3,6) down and left. So if I keep moving right, the body will shift accordingly, and I need to make sure that each step is safe.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT: (4,6)
2. Move DOWN: (4,5)
3. Then perhaps continue moving down or right again, but ensuring that each move doesn't cause a collision with the body or walls.

Wait, maybe I should consider moving right first to get closer to the apple's x-coordinate. The apple is at (7,2), which requires 4 moves to the right from (3,6). So the initial steps should focus on moving right as much as possible.

But moving right too much early on might cause the snake to get stuck if it can't turn down later without reversing direction. So perhaps a balanced approach is needed.

I also need to ensure that after each move, the body segments don't overlap with any part of the snake's current position or future positions. For example, when moving right, the new head at (4,6) should not coincide with any body segment except possibly the tail if it's about to move.

Wait, no, because the body segments are behind the head, so as long as the head moves into an empty space, it should be okay. The collision check is for the new_head coinciding with any BODYi except when the tail is moving.

So, after each move, I need to check if the new_head is within bounds and not overlapping with any body segment except possibly the tail's current cell when that tail will move.

Let me try mapping out a potential path:

1. Move RIGHT to (4,6). This is safe because the body is at (2,6), (2,5), (1,5). The new_head is (4,6), which isn't occupied by any body segment.
2. Next, move RIGHT again to (5,6). Still safe as the body hasn't caught up yet.
3. Continue moving right: (6,6) and then (7,6). But wait, the apple is at (7,2). So from (7,6), moving down would get closer to (7,2).

However, moving down from (7,6) would require the snake to start descending. Let's see:

4. Move DOWN to (7,5)
5. Then move DOWN again to (7,4)
6. Then move DOWN again to (7,3)
7. Finally, move DOWN to (7,2), which is the apple.

But I need to make sure that after each move, the body segments don't collide with anything. Let's check:

After step 1: head at (4,6). Body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. Next move right to (5,6). Safe.
Step 2: head at (5,6). Body becomes [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)].
Step 3: head at (6,6). Body shifts to include (5,6) and so on. Still safe.
Step 4: head at (7,6). Now, the apple is at (7,2). So the next move would be down.

But moving down from (7,6) is possible as long as it's within bounds. Let's say we do that:

5. Move DOWN to (7,5). Check if this is safe. The body segments are now [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. So (7,5) isn't occupied by any of them.
6. Move DOWN to (7,4). Similarly safe.
7. Move DOWN to (7,3). Still okay.
8. Finally, move DOWN to (7,2), which is the apple.

But wait, after step 1-4, moving right four times gets us to (7,6). Then moving down four times gets us to (7,2).

However, each time we move, the body segments shift forward, so the tail could potentially overlap with the new_head's previous position if not careful.

Wait no, because after each move, the body is updated by inserting the old head at the front and removing the tail unless eating the apple. So as long as the new_head doesn't coincide with any body segment except the tail when it's about to move, it should be safe.

In this case, moving right four times from (3,6) to (7,6), then down four times would result in the head reaching (7,2). However, each time we move, the body segments are shifting forward, so by the time we reach (7,6), the tail is at (1,5). Then moving down from there should not cause any collisions because the body is still behind.

But I need to make sure that after all moves, the snake doesn't get stuck. For example, if the tail is at a position that blocks further movement, but in this case, since we're growing by eating the apple, the tail remains and allows movement forward.

Wait, when the head reaches (7,2), it will eat the apple, so the body grows by one segment. That means the tail doesn't move that turn, which could help in avoiding getting stuck.

Another consideration is the initial direction. Since the snake starts moving right, the first move must be either right or down, but I think starting with as many rights as possible makes sense because the apple's x-coordinate is higher.

But let me think about another aspect: after moving right four times and then down four times, the total moves would be 8. But maybe there's a more efficient path that allows the snake to navigate without getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps moving right three times, then down twice, then right again, but I need to ensure that each move is valid and doesn't cause collisions.

Wait, another idea: from (3,6), moving right to (4,6), then right to (5,6), then down to (5,5). Then continue moving down or right in a way that approaches the apple without colliding with the body.

But I need to map this carefully. Let's try planning step by step:

1. Move RIGHT: (4,6)
2. Move RIGHT: (5,6)
3. Move DOWN: (5,5)
4. Move DOWN: (5,4)
5. Move DOWN: (5,3)
6. Move LEFT: (4,3) â€“ but wait, can't reverse direction if current is DOWN.
Wait, after the initial direction is RIGHT, the first move must be either RIGHT or DOWN. So moving down from (5,6) to (5,5) is allowed.

Then, from (5,5), I can choose directions that don't reverse. Since the last move was DOWN, next moves can be DOWN again or LEFT or RIGHT if possible without reversing.

But after moving right and then down, perhaps a better path would involve moving in a spiral or diagonal to reach the apple without colliding with body segments.

Alternatively, maybe moving right first, then down, then right, etc., while avoiding the body.

Wait, I think the initial plan of moving right four times and then down four times is feasible. Let's check:

After 4 rights: (7,6). Then 4 downs: (7,2).

Each move in between would shift the body segments forward, but since the tail is at (1,5), and the head moves to (4,6) etc., no collisions should occur.

But I need to make sure that after each move, the new_head doesn't overlap with any body segment. Let's simulate:

After first right: (4,6). Body is [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. No collision.
Second right: (5,6). Body becomes [(4,6), (3,6), ...]. Still no collision.
Third right: (6,6). Body shifts again. Safe.
Fourth right: (7,6). Body is now [(6,6), ..., (2,5)]. Safe.

Now, moving down from (7,6):

Fifth move: DOWN to (7,5). Is this safe? The body's tail is at (1,5) and the rest are at higher y-coordinates. So yes, (7,5) is empty.
Sixth move: DOWN to (7,4). Still okay.
Seventh move: DOWN to (7,3). Fine.
Eighth move: DOWN to (7,2), which is the apple.

So this seems like a valid path of 8 moves. But maybe there's a shorter way or a way that doesn't require moving all the way to y=6 first.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving right twice, we can start moving down and then continue.

But I think sticking with the initial plan is safe and ensures the head reaches (7,2) without colliding.

Another consideration: when the snake grows by eating the apple at (7,2), it adds another segment. So the tail remains at its current position, which in this case would be after several moves.

But wait, during each move, the tail shifts forward. So if we have a path where the tail is moving towards (1,5) and then further as the snake grows, but when we reach the apple, the tail stays, so it might cause issues later on. However, since the goal is to reach the apple, that's acceptable.

In summary, the proposed path is:

1. Move RIGHT four times from (3,6) to (7,6).
2. Then move DOWN four times from (7,6) to (7,2).

This results in a total of 8 moves: 4 right and 4 down.

Each step must be checked for safety regarding body segments and bounds.

Yes, each step seems safe as per the initial analysis.
</think>

To reach the apple at (7,2), the snake should move right four times to (7,6) and then down four times to (7,2). Each move is valid and avoids collisions with body segments or walls.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move Right:** From (3,6) â†’ (4,6)
   - Safe as the body segments are at lower x-coordinates.
   
2. **Move Right:** From (4,6) â†’ (5,6)
   - The body shifts but doesn't collide with the new head position.
   
3. **Move Right:** From (5,6) â†’ (6,6)
   - Still safe as the body is yet to reach this point.
   
4. **Move Right:** From (6,6) â†’ (7,6)
   - Reached the maximum x-coordinate; now proceed downward.
   
5. **Move Down:** From (7,6) â†’ (7,5)
   - Safe as no body segment occupies this cell.
   
6. **Move Down:** From (7,5) â†’ (7,4)
   - Still within grid bounds and clear of body segments.
   
7. **Move Down:** From (7,4) â†’ (7,3)
   - No collision issues here either.
   
8. **Move Down:** From (7,3) â†’ (7,2)
   - Reached the apple; the snake grows by one segment without moving the tail.

**Final Answer:**

The snake should move right four times and then down four times to safely reach the apple at (7,2). The path is as follows:

1. Right â†’ (4,6)
2. Right â†’ (5,6)
3. Right â†’ (6,6)
4. Right â†’ (7,6)
5. Down â†’ (7,5)
6. Down â†’ (7,4)
7. Down â†’ (7,3)
8. Down â†’ (7,2)

Each move is valid and ensures the snake avoids collisions and stays within the grid boundaries.

**Answer:** The snake should move right four times and then down four times: Right, Right, Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down.

So, the final sequence of moves is: $\boxed{\text{Right, Right, Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down}}$
