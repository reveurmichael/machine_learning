BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>We are given inputs: 
- Head position: (8,7)
- Current direction: LEFT (which means previous movement was left) so snake is coming from right relative to head? Actually current direction is LEFT.
- Body cells: [(9,8), (9,7)] - these are body segments after the head. They represent positions on grid that have been visited by snake's body, excluding head. So currently snake occupies positions (head: (8,7) and then next segment (body): (9,8)? Actually check: given "Body cells: [(9,8), (9,7)]", but note order? But they said list of cells occupied by snake's body (excluding the head). That means these are segments behind. But wait, if current direction is left, then the snake came from right? Wait, let's consider that the snake's head is at (8, 7) and its body includes (9,8), (9,7). Let me check coordinates: (8,7) to apple (9,6)? Possibly not.

We need to plan a safe path for head to reach the apple. Apple position: (9,6).

Let's re-read instructions:
- grid 10x10 from bottom left coordinate (0,0) to top right (9,9).
- snake head is at (8,7). Its current direction is LEFT meaning that its last move was left? Actually "current direction" means the one it will follow if we don't change? But then rule: The snake cannot reverse direction. That means if the snake's current direction is LEFT, then you can't immediately go RIGHT because that would be a reversal.

Wait check rules: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If current direction is "NONE", any move allowed, but here current direction is left so not none. So must plan moves such that the first move does not reverse current direction. That means we can't choose RIGHT because it's exactly opposite to LEFT.

Wait let me check: if snake is going left, then reversal would be right? Yes.

So possible safe moves: From head (8,7) and body segments at positions (9,8), (9,7). But caution: Actually given coordinates must re-check:
- Head position: (8,7).
- Body cells: [(9,8), (9,7)].
But wait a minute: There's potential collision possibility if we choose move that would cause head to become one of these body segments? Let's check grid boundaries.

We want the snake to eventually reach apple at (9,6). The difference in coordinates:
- x offset: apple x=9, head x=8 so must have more RIGHT moves than left by 1. Specifically right - left = 1.
- y offset: apple y=6, head y=7 so need to do down move relative count such that DOWN moves - UP moves equals (7 - 6) equals 1.

But note "final position check" says: The number of RIGHT moves minus the number of LEFT moves should equal (9-8)=1 and the number of DOWN moves minus the number of UP moves should equal (7-6)=1. That means we want one net right move, and one net down move. But note our snake is currently going left? So current direction is left.

So possible moves: The apple is to the right and down relative to head's current position? Let me compute:
Head at (8,7), Apple at (9,6). Vector from head to apple = (1, -1). That means you need one move RIGHT and one move DOWN. But wait what about constraint "The snake cannot reverse direction"? If the snake is going left currently, then a potential reversal would be right if we try to go RIGHT immediately. So must not choose RIGHT as first move because that's opposite of left.

So initial possible moves: We can either go UP or DOWN or continue LEFT? Let's check:
- Continue LEFT: That means move from (8,7) to (7,7). But apple is at (9,6), so then route would be going further away. But could be safe as detour if necessary. But careful: body segments are in positions? The snake's body occupies (9,8) and (9,7). If we continue left, from (8,7) to (7,7) is free, but check grid boundaries: It's within bounds because 7 between 0 and 9 for x. But then how would the snake reach apple? Possibly we can detour later.
- Could choose DOWN: That means move head from (8,7) to (8,6). But note if the snake goes down, that is not reversal of left? Left's opposite is right; down is not opposite left, so it's allowed.

Wait but check potential collision with body segments: The snake's body segments are at (9,8) and (9,7) which means they are behind head in direction? Actually if snake is going left, its tail was coming from the right. But then what positions are safe to move into? Let me simulate possible moves:

We have snake:
Head: (8,7)
Body segments: first segment: (9,8), second segment: (9,7).

So, in grid coordinates: (x,y) where x increases to right and y increases upward. So which cells are adjacent to head? They are:
- Up: (8,8) but then check if any body cell is (8,8)? None of them.
- Down: (8,6) safe? But we need to check body segments? The body segments are at (9,7) and (9,8). None conflict with (8,6).
- Left: (7,7)
- Right: (9,7)

Wait, note the head's neighbor RIGHT is (9,7), but that's occupied by a body segment. So cannot go right.

So valid immediate moves from (8,7) are up, down, left.
But current direction is LEFT so we cannot choose opposite of left which is RIGHT anyway, so that's consistent.

Now think: The apple at (9,6). We need to get there eventually with safe path. Also consider constraints: "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." But for our planning, it doesn't matter if we plan a minimal sequence of moves because we just need a safe route from head position to apple and then ensure that after reaching apple, not stuck.
We can plan path in two parts: first going from (8,7) to apple at (9,6). The simplest vector is one right and one down. But note initial move cannot be right because snake's current direction is left, so cannot reverse direction? Actually check constraint "Must not reverse direction on the first move" means if current direction is LEFT then going RIGHT is a reversal since opposite of left is right.
So can't do immediate right.

What are possible sequences? We want to achieve net: 1 more right than left and net down difference of 1. The moves must sum up to that vector.
Possible sequence could be:
If starting with DOWN move from (8,7) -> (8,6). Then we want a right move eventually to reach apple's x coordinate =9? Actually after that, if head is at (8,6), then apple is at (9,6). So need a right move. But can we do a right move next? Let's check: Current direction is left, so first move was down, but second move is now going to be right. That would be allowed because "Must not reverse current direction on the first move", but after that, no such constraint? Actually wait re-read rule: "The snake cannot reverse direction" means you are not allowed to go in exactly opposite direction of what it came from last turn? But does it apply only for the first move or every move? The text says "The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next)." That implies that each new move must not be the exact opposite. It doesn't say after the second move reversal is allowed unless it would result in reversing last move's direction.
But then rule "Must not reverse direction on the first move" means that if current direction is left, you cannot choose right as your immediate move. But for subsequent moves, does that constraint apply? The problem statement only says "The snake cannot reverse direction", so I assume it applies every time: i.e., each new move must not be opposite to previous direction. So if we do first move down (which is allowed since it's not reversal of left because left's reverse is right), then second move can't be the reverse of down, which would be up. So going right is allowed because that's not a reversal of down. But wait: check constraint "cannot reverse direction on the first move" might only apply to the immediate move after current direction? It says "if going UP, cannot move DOWN next" etc. So if you are currently moving LEFT, then your next move cannot be RIGHT since that is opposite left. But for subsequent moves, the rule remains: The snake can't reverse its previous move. So if we go down first, then next move must not be up. And right is fine because it's not up.

So sequence possibility:
Move 1: DOWN from (8,7) to (8,6).
Now head becomes at (8,6), direction last move was DOWN.
Then Move 2: RIGHT from (8,6) to (9,6). That arrives at apple at (9,6).

Check if safe: After the first move, head is now at (8,6). Check collision with body segments? Body segments were originally [(9,8), (9,7)].
Let's simulate snake movement: The snake has head (8,7) then its body. But after moving down:
- The new head becomes (8,6).
- The old head (8,7) becomes the first segment of the body? But wait careful simulation: In typical snake game, when snake moves, the tail is removed unless apple eaten. So the previous positions update as follows: Before move, snake positions: Head = (8,7), Body segments = (9,8) then (9,7). After moving down:
New head becomes (8,6).
Then body segments become previous head (8,7) and then previous second segment? Wait but the instructions "Snake movement update" says:
"Head becomes body segment", tail is removed unless apple eaten. So after move 1, snake positions: Head becomes (8,6), and then the old head becomes a body cell, so body = [(8,7)] appended to what remains from previous? But wait careful simulation: Let's simulate step by step:

Initial snake:
Segment order:
Head at (8,7)
Body segments in order [body1 = (9,8), body2 = (9,7)].
After move:
New head = old head + direction vector.
Tail removed if apple not eaten.

For first move down: New head becomes (8,7) + (0,-1) = (8,6).
Then snake's new positions become:
- Head: (8,6)
- Body: becomes previous head (8,7) and then the rest of body? But wait, snake moves like: New snake = [head'] followed by old snake excluding tail.
The old snake was 3 segments: [(8,7), (9,8), (9,7)].
Tail removal means remove last element. So new snake becomes:
Head: (8,6)
Body: then add previous head? Actually typical algorithm: snake = [new head] + snake[0:len(snake)-1]. So that yields: new snake = [(8,6), (8,7), (9,8)].
But check: original body segments were given as list of positions excluding the head. But for simulation, I'll consider entire snake as ordered list with head first, then others in sequence behind it. But we must note that the last element is removed because tail is not eaten apple? Actually since no apple is eaten yet, the tail is removed.
So after first move:
New snake becomes: [head new = (8,6), body = [(8,7), (9,8)]]. And (9,7) gets dropped from the snake because it was tail.
So then second move right:
From head at (8,6) going right gives new head = (8,6)+(1,0) = (9,6).
After moving: update snake becomes:
New head becomes (9,6)
The old head (8,6) becomes body segment,
And the rest of snake from previous move is [ (8,7), (9,8)].
So new snake positions become: [(9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (9,8)].
Check collision with apple? Now at head (9,6) that's where apple was. After eating apple, tail remains and score increases but snake grows by one segment, so presumably now the snake becomes 4 segments: The apple is eaten and then the snake does not remove tail.
So after move 2, snake becomes:
[(9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (9,8)] with new head at (9,6) which matches apple location. But we must check if there's potential collision after eating apple? Check constraint: "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." That means the snake should not be trapped in a space where it cannot move safely.
Now from new head (9,6) and body positions as above, is there at least one free cell for next move?
Let's simulate possible moves after eating apple. The snake's body now: Head = (9,6), Body segments in order [ (8,6), (8,7), (9,8)]. Let's list them: 
Segment 1: (9,6) - head.
Segment 2: (8,6)
Segment 3: (8,7)
Segment 4: (9,8)

Which cells are adjacent to new head (9,6)? They are:
- Up: (9,7). Is it free? But check snake positions: we have segment at (9,8) but not (9,7), body segments are (8,6), (8,7), and (9,8). So (9,7) is not in snake.
- Down: (9,5).
- Left: (8,6) which is occupied by second segment.
- Right: (10,6), but grid? We assume grid boundaries? Possibly if grid is infinite or sufficiently large. Not sure if we need to worry about boundaries.
Assuming board is sufficiently big and no immediate trap exists because there are at least 3 moves available? Let's check: But wait, potential traps might exist if snake body is surrounding head. The new head (9,6) with adjacent body segments: left blocked by body segment (8,6), but up, down, right are free? So it seems safe.

Let me double-check potential alternative route: What if we started with move 1: DOWN then move 2: RIGHT? That yields net vector (0,-1)+(1,0) = (1, -1). But required is apple at (9,6) which from starting position (8,7) difference is (1,-1)? Because (8,7) to (9,6) equals (1, -1) yes.
So that sequence works and meets vector sum.

Now check potential collision:
After first move, snake becomes: head = (8,6), body = old head becomes (8,7), then previous second segment (9,8). And tail removed was (9,7). But wait a moment. Check potential conflict after first move:
The new head (8,6) is not occupied by any body segments because old snake had (8,7) and (9,8) and (9,7)? Actually, the simulation should be: initial snake order: [H1=(8,7), B1=(9,8), B2=(9,7)]. Then after move 1 down:
New head = H1 + (0,-1) = (8,6).
Then new body = old snake without tail. The tail is last element: so remove B2 = (9,7). So then new snake order becomes: [head = (8,6), then old head (8,7), then remaining body segment from before? Wait, we need to be careful. There are 3 segments total initially.
Snake positions:
Segment indices: 
1: head: (8,7)
2: next: (9,8)
3: tail: (9,7)

After moving: new snake becomes: [New head = old head + move, then the rest of the body except last segment].
So that's: New snake = [(8,6), (8,7), (9,8)].
So after first move, snake segments:
Head: (8,6)
Segment 2: (8,7)
Segment 3: (9,8).

Now check collisions: The new head is at (8,6) which is not equal to any of the others. And if we consider board boundaries, assume it's safe.

Then move 2 right:
New head = old head + (1,0). So new head becomes (8,6)+(1,0) = (9,6).
Then snake update: Remove tail from previous snake (which was segment3 previously which is now removed because no apple eaten? But then if apple is eaten now, we do not remove tail. Wait careful:
At move 2, the apple location is exactly the new head position, so apple is eaten. The instructions "after eating apple, tail remains" i.e., snake grows by one segment.
So simulation for move 2 right: 
Before move 2, snake = [(8,6), (8,7), (9,8)].
Move vector RIGHT: new head becomes (8,6)+(1,0) = (9,6).
Now because apple is at (9,6) and is eaten, the tail does not get removed. So new snake order becomes:
New snake = [new head (9,6), then old head from previous move become body segment, then remaining segments]. That means: 
Segment list becomes: [(9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (9,8)].
Check collisions: Head at (9,6) is not in the rest. So that's safe.

Then check legal moves after eating apple from new head (9,6): Adjacent cells:
Up: (9,7) free because snake body occupies? It does not match any of these coordinates.
Down: (9,5) free,
Left: (8,6) is occupied by second segment,
Right: (10,6) presumably free if grid is large. So at least two moves exist so it's not trapped.

So that sequence seems safe.

But also check the condition "Ensure there's at least one legal move afterward" which is satisfied here.
However, we must consider potential collisions with the snake's body on future moves? The problem states: "After eating apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." I need to ensure that after reaching apple, the snake isn't trapped. But since board is sufficiently open and we only simulate two moves, it should be fine.

Thus sequence of 2 moves:
Move1: DOWN
Move2: RIGHT

Double-check the net displacement from (8,7) -> (9,6): first move gives (0,-1), second gives (1,0). Sum equals (1,-1). That exactly matches apple position.

Also check if it violates any rules about reversal? The snake's previous direction was LEFT. So the first move is DOWN which is not left's reverse (left's reverse would be RIGHT) so that's allowed.
Then for second move, previous direction becomes DOWN and then next move is RIGHT, which is not opposite to down because opposite of down is up, so it's allowed.

So answer: "DOWN, RIGHT" as moves sequence? But wait the problem statement: "Plan your path using 2 commands: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L) or Right (R)." So output should be a list or sequence of letters that correspond to these directions. And possibly also include some reasoning about ensuring a safe move after apple is eaten?

Maybe I need to mention if there are alternative sequences? The problem text "Plan your path" might imply that the intended solution is 2 moves: first D then R.

But wait, one more possibility: Could we choose left first then right then down? That would be three moves. But minimal move sequence is 2 moves, which satisfies net displacement of (1,-1). But note that if we choose DOWN first then RIGHT second, the snake's new direction will change from LEFT to DOWN and then to RIGHT. But does this cause reversal issues with consecutive moves? Let’s check: Initially current direction = left. So allowed first move is any except right because that would be reversal of left. Down is fine.
Then on second move, previous direction is now down so cannot choose up, but right is fine.

Thus answer sequence "D, R" seems valid and minimal.

I need to double-check collision with body segments after each move:

Initial snake: head (8,7), body segments (9,8) and (9,7).

If first move is DOWN:
New head becomes (8,6). Check if any of new snake's positions become colliding? The old snake segments that remain are (8,7) from head and then the segment previously at (9,8) from body. So they are not equal to (8,6), so it's safe.

After second move (R):
New head becomes (8,6)+(1,0) = (9,6). Then snake update: new snake order becomes:
- Head: (9,6)
- Then previous head (8,6) and then the rest of body segments from before.
So that's [ (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (9,8) ].
Check if any collisions? None because (9,6) is new head and no other segment equals it. Also check boundaries: (9,6) is within the board assuming 0-indexed coordinates. It might be edge though but we assume it's safe.

After apple eaten, snake grows by one segment. But then ensure next move safety:
Check possible moves from head at (9,6). Adjacent cells: up is (9,7), down is (9,5), left is (8,6) which is occupied, right is (10,6).
But wait, check if (9,7) would be safe? It's not equal to any snake body cell currently. So there are at least 3 legal moves. But caution: (9,7) might eventually cause collision with the growing tail if it remains static but we only need one safe move for now.

I must also check potential issue: "After eating apple, avoid traps." Might be a constraint that sometimes the snake is trapped because its head touches boundaries or body segments cover nearly all adjacent cells. But here it's not. 

Maybe I want to consider if there's any alternative route that might cause issues with reversal? Possibly not.

Thus answer sequence is: 
Step 1: Down
Step 2: Right

I can now produce final answer accordingly.

However, let me check if the intended solution may be "DR" (D then R) or maybe "RU"? Let's recalc: initial coordinates of head are (8,7), apple at (9,6). To get to apple, you need x +1 and y -1. So either do D first then R, or R first then D? But wait if we try R first then D:
- Starting with left as current direction, allowed move is not right because that's reversal of left. So can't choose right first.
Thus the only possibility is DOWN then RIGHT.

I must check if any other sequence such as a simultaneous "diagonal" move exists? But snake moves are only orthogonal commands.

Therefore answer: Down then Right.

Now I'll produce final answer with explanation. Possibly also mention that after eating apple, you have legal moves available, and the body does not trap you.

I need to be careful if board boundaries matter: The head is at (8,7) and apple at (9,6). It means that the apple is one step to right and one step down relative to current position. But wait, 9,6 means x coordinate increased by 1? Wait let me check: initial head: (8,7). Apple: (9,6). The difference in coordinates: (9-8, 6-7) = (1, -1). So if you go down, then right, that sums to (0,-1)+(1,0) = (1,-1). If you try right then down, that would be (1,0)+(0,-1) but check reversal rule: Current direction is left so allowed moves are not right because that's reversal? But wait, if we go from left to right in one move, that is a reversal. So must choose Down first.

Thus answer "D R".

I'll now produce final answer. I'll also provide explanation along with commands maybe in plain text.

I'll now produce answer accordingly.

----

I'll produce final answer: The moves are "Down" then "Right." I'll produce answer as: D, R. Possibly list them and explain that after these moves the apple is eaten and there will be legal moves available, etc.

I'll now produce final answer.</think>We start with the snake’s head at (8,7) while the apple is at (9,6). Notice that to go from (8,7) to (9,6) you must move one step to the right (+1 in x) and one step down (–1 in y).

However, there’s an extra twist: the snake’s current direction is Left. This means that on its very first move it cannot reverse direction—that is, it cannot go Right immediately.

A simple way to achieve the required net movement without reversing too soon is as follows:

Step 1 – Move Down:
 • The head goes from (8,7) to (8,6).  
 • This change does not conflict with the snake’s body because after this move the snake’s segments are updated (the old head becomes a body segment, and the tail is removed).

Step 2 – Move Right:
 • Now the head goes from (8,6) to (9,6), which exactly lands on the apple.
 • Since the previous move was Down, moving Right now does not reverse the prior direction.

After these two moves the snake has reached the apple. Moreover, when the apple is eaten the snake grows by one segment and there will still be at least one free adjacent cell (for example, Up to (9,7) or further right) available for a subsequent move, ensuring that the snake isn’t trapped.

Thus, the optimal sequence of commands is:
 Down, then Right.
```
