========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

 {
    "moves": ["RIGHT"],
    "reasoning": "The snake is currently at (8,2) and the apple is located at (7,3). Since we cannot reverse direction on the first move, we choose to move right once to reach (9,2), which is a safe position as it's within the grid bounds. This initial move keeps the Manhattan distance between the head and the apple decreasing while avoiding immediate self-collision."
