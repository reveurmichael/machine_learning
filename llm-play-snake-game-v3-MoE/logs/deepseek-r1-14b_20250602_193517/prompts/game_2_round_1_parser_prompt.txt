<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to the apple at (2,7). The current direction is NONE, so I can choose any direction for the first move. 

First, looking at the coordinates: the head is at (5,5), and the apple is at (2,7). So, the x-coordinate needs to decrease by 3, and the y-coordinate needs to increase by 2. That means I'll need more LEFT moves than RIGHT, and more UP moves than DOWN.

Since the current direction is NONE, the first move can be any direction except reversing. Reversing isn't an issue here since it's NONE, so all directions are allowed.

Let me sketch a possible path:

1. The apple is to the northwest of the head. So, moving LEFT and then UP seems logical.

But wait, the body cells are empty, so there's no immediate collision risk from the body. However, I need to plan for future moves where the body might block the way.

If I start by moving LEFT once, that would take me to (4,5). Then, perhaps move UP to (4,6), then another UP to (4,7). But wait, the apple is at (2,7), so I need to go further left from there. Let's see:

After each move, I'll add a new head position and manage the body.

First move: LEFT to (4,5).
Second move: UP to (4,6).
Third move: UP to (4,7).
Fourth move: LEFT to (3,7).
Fifth move: LEFT to (2,7), which is where the apple is.

But wait, after each move, I have to check if the new head position doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the tail. Since initially, the body is empty, that's fine.

However, when moving towards (2,7), I need to ensure that after eating the apple, the snake isn't trapped. After eating, the body grows by one, so the tail remains in its position. Then, on the next move, there should be at least one valid direction.

Let me count the moves needed: from (5,5) to (2,7), we need 3 LEFTs and 2 UPs. But the order matters because moving straight towards the apple might block us if the body grows in a way that creates a loop or blocks movement.

Alternatively, another path could be:

1. DOWN (to 5,4)
2. LEFT (4,4)
3. LEFT (3,4)
4. UP (3,5)
5. UP (3,6)
6. UP (3,7)
7. LEFT (2,7)

But that's more moves and might not be necessary.

Wait, maybe the shortest path is better: 3 LEFTs and 2 UPs in some order. Let's try:

Move 1: LEFT to (4,5)
Move 2: UP to (4,6)
Move 3: UP to (4,7)
Move 4: LEFT to (3,7)
Move 5: LEFT to (2,7)

This is five moves. But does this path cause any issues?

Wait, after each move, the body grows only when eating the apple. So in these first four moves before reaching the apple, the snake's length remains the same because it's not eating anything yet.

After the fifth move, it eats the apple and grows by one. Then, on the next move, the tail doesn't get removed, so the body is longer. But we have to ensure that after growing, there's at least one valid direction left.

In this case, after reaching (2,7), the head is now at the apple's position. The body would be extended, but as long as I don't move into any of the previous body cells except possibly the tail, it should be fine.

Wait, but let me check the movement rules again. When moving, if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn, the snake dies.

So in the fifth move, after eating the apple, the body becomes longer by one segment. So when planning moves beyond that, I need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with any body segments except possibly the new tail.

But since we're only asked for the path up to eating the apple, maybe just providing the initial moves is sufficient.

Wait, no—the problem says to plan a safe path where after each move, the snake doesn't die. So I need to make sure that in each step, including the final one, there's no collision.

Let me try another approach:

Start at (5,5). The apple is at (2,7), which is three steps left and two up.

So, possible directions could be LEFT thrice and UP twice. Let's arrange them in a way that doesn't cause the snake to reverse direction or collide with its body.

Since the initial direction is NONE, first move can be any. Let's choose LEFT.

Move 1: LEFT → (4,5)
Now, head is at (4,5), body is [ (5,5) ] since we added the old head.

Next move: UP to (4,6). Body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5) ]? Wait, no—after each move, the old head is inserted into the front of the body. So after moving LEFT, the body was [ (5,5) ] because we added the old head.

Wait, no—the initial body is empty. After first move:

- New head: (4,5)
- Body becomes [ (5,5) ]

Second move: UP → new head (4,6)
Body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5) ]
Because we insert the old head into front.

Third move: UP again → new head (4,7)
Body becomes [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]

Fourth move: LEFT → (3,7)
Body becomes [ (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]

Fifth move: LEFT → (2,7). At this point, new_head is the apple's position. So we check for collision.

Before moving, the body is [ (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]? Wait no—each move adds the old head to the front and then possibly removes the tail unless eating an apple.

Wait, let's step through each move carefully:

Initial state: Head at (5,5), body is empty. Direction is NONE.

Move 1: LEFT → new_head = (4,5)
- Check collision: no body segments except old head, which is added to front of body.
- Body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Update head to (4,5). So full snake is [(4,5), (5,5)]

Move 2: UP → new_head = (4,6)
- Check collision: body is [(5,5)], which is not same as new_head.
- Insert old head (4,5) into front of body → body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (5,5). So body is [ (4,5) ]
- Head updated to (4,6). Full snake: [(4,6), (4,5)]

Move 3: UP → new_head = (4,7)
- Check collision: body is [(4,5)], which doesn't conflict.
- Insert old head (4,6) into front of body → [ (4,6), (4,5) ]
- Remove tail (4,5). Body becomes [ (4,6) ]
- Head updated to (4,7). Full snake: [(4,7), (4,6)]

Move 4: LEFT → new_head = (3,7)
- Check collision: body is [(4,6)], which doesn't conflict.
- Insert old head (4,7) into front of body → [ (4,7), (4,6) ]
- Remove tail (4,6). Body becomes [ (4,7) ]
- Head updated to (3,7). Full snake: [(3,7), (4,7)]

Move 5: LEFT → new_head = (2,7)
- Check collision: body is [(4,7)], which doesn't conflict.
- Insert old head (3,7) into front of body → [ (3,7), (4,7) ]
- Since new_head == apple position, grow the snake: do not remove tail. So body becomes [ (3,7), (4,7) ] + new head (2,7)? Wait, no—the insertion is before checking.

Wait, in step 5:

After choosing LEFT again, new_head is (2,7). This is the apple's position.

- Insert old head (3,7) into front of body → [ (3,7), (4,7) ]
- Since new_head == apple, we don't remove tail. So body becomes [ (3,7), (4,7), (2,7) ]? Wait no—the body list after inserting is [ (3,7), (4,7) ], and then since it's eating the apple, the tail remains. So the new body is [ (3,7), (4,7), (2,7) ]?

Wait, I'm getting confused here.

The movement update rule says:

a. Insert old head position at front of BODY → so after step 4, body was [ (4,7) ]. When moving LEFT in step 5, the old head is (3,7). So inserting that into front makes the body [ (3,7), (4,7) ].

Then, since it's eating the apple, we don't remove the tail. So the new body after this move would be [ (3,7), (4,7) ], and then when moving again in the next step, if any, we have to manage accordingly.

But actually, in this case, after the fifth move, the snake's head is at (2,7). The body before inserting was [ (3,7) ] because in step 4, after moving LEFT, the body was [ (4,7) ], and then when moving again in step 5, the old head is added to front.

Wait no—step by step:

After move 1:
- Head: (4,5)
- Body: [ (5,5) ]

Move 2:
- Head: (4,6)
- Body after inserting old head: [ (4,5), (5,5) ]
- Remove tail: body becomes [ (4,5) ]

Move 3:
- Head: (4,7)
- Insert old head: [ (4,6), (4,5) ]
- Remove tail: body becomes [ (4,6) ]

Wait no—no, in move 2, after inserting the old head (4,5), the body is [ (4,5), (5,5) ]. Then since it's not eating apple, remove tail → body becomes [ (4,5) ].

Move 3: UP to (4,7)
- Insert old head (4,6) → body becomes [ (4,6), (4,5) ]
- Remove tail (4,5) → body is [ (4,6) ]

Wait this seems inconsistent. Let me try to track the body correctly.

Each move:

1. After move 1: head at (4,5). Body is empty except for old head added after moving.
   - So when you move, the new head is computed, then old head is inserted into front of body, then if not apple, remove tail.

So step by step:

Move 1:
- Current head: (5,5)
- Move LEFT → new_head = (4,5)
- Insert old head (5,5) into front of empty body → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Since no apple eaten, remove tail (5,5). Body is now empty.
- So after move 1: head at (4,5), body is empty.

Wait that doesn't make sense. Wait the rule says:

a. Insert old head position at front of BODY → so old head is added to front

b. If not eating apple, remove tail.

So in move 1:

- Old head: (5,5)
- new_head: (4,5)
- insert (5,5) into front → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- since not eating apple, remove tail → body is empty again.
Wait that would mean the body remains empty after each move unless we eat an apple.

But that can't be right because then the snake wouldn't grow in length when it's supposed to. Hmm.

Wait no—wait, the initial state is head at (5,5), body is empty.

Move 1: LEFT → new_head = (4,5)
- Insert old head into front of body → [ (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail → which would be the first element, but the body is now [ (5,5) ], so removing tail makes it empty.

So after move 1: head at (4,5), body remains empty. That doesn't make sense because when you move, the old head becomes part of the body.

I think I'm misunderstanding the rules. Let me re-examine:

The movement update rule says:

a. Insert old head position at front of BODY

b. If it's not an apple eating move, remove tail (last element) from the body.

So in each move, after moving, you add the previous head to the front, then if not growing, remove the last element.

Therefore, after first move:

- new_head = (4,5)
- insert old head (5,5) into front → [ (5,5) ]
- since it's a normal move, remove tail → body becomes empty again.

Wait that would mean the snake remains with only the head each time until it eats an apple. That seems wrong because when you move, the body should follow.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is:

Each time, after moving, the new head is at the front, and the old head is added to the body, which could grow unless eating.

But I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently.

When the snake moves, it leaves a trail behind except when it eats food (apple in this case). So each move adds the previous head to the body, and if not eating, removes the last segment from the body.

Therefore:

Move 1: Head at (5,5), move LEFT → new_head = (4,5)
- Add old head (5,5) to front of body → [ (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (which is nothing in empty case?), so body remains [ (5,5) ]

Wait no—if the body was empty before moving, inserting the old head into front makes it [ (5,5) ], then removing tail would leave it as [ ] because you can't have a body longer than one? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the body is empty, after adding the old head and not eating, the body remains with that segment. So:

Move 1: Head at (4,5), body becomes [ (5,5) ]

But then on next move, moving again would add another segment to front.

Wait I think I need a better way to model this.

Perhaps it's best to simulate each move step by step correctly.

Let me try again:

Initial state:
- Head: (5,5)
- Body: []
- Direction: NONE

Move 1: LEFT
- New_head = (4,5)
- Insert old head into front of body → body becomes [ (5,5) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (last element). But since the body is now [ (5,5) ], removing tail would result in empty. So body remains [ (5,5) ]?
Wait no—if you add to front and then remove from end, it's like a queue.

So after inserting old head into front, the body becomes [ (5,5) ]. Then, since not eating apple, remove last element → which is (5,5), making body empty again. That can't be right because that would mean the snake has no body segments.

I think perhaps I'm misapplying the rules. Maybe when you insert into front, it's added and then if not growing, you remove the last element only if the body length exceeds some limit.

But according to the problem statement, the movement update rule is:

a. Insert old head position at front of BODY

b. If it's not an apple eating move, remove tail (last) from BODY.

So regardless of current length, each non-apple move adds one and removes one.

Therefore, the body length remains constant except when eating an apple.

Given that the initial body is empty:

Move 1: LEFT
- Insert old head into front → [ (5,5) ]
- Remove tail → body becomes empty again.
So after first move, body is empty. That seems odd because in reality, moving a snake adds to its body.

Wait perhaps I'm misapplying the rules.

Alternatively, maybe the rule is:

When you move, add old head to front of body, and if not eating apple, remove the last segment (the tail). So with initial empty body, after first move:

- Add old head → [ (5,5) ]
- Remove tail (which doesn't exist), so body remains [ (5,5) ]

So after move 1: head at (4,5), body is [ (5,5) ]

Move 2: UP
- new_head = (4,6)
- insert old head (4,5) into front → [ (4,5), (5,5) ]
- remove tail (5,5) → body becomes [ (4,5) ]

So after move 2: head at (4,6), body is [ (4,5) ]

Move 3: UP
- new_head = (4,7)
- insert old head (4,6) into front → [ (4,6), (4,5) ]
- remove tail (4,5) → body becomes [ (4,6) ]

After move 3: head at (4,7), body is [ (4,6) ]

Move 4: LEFT
- new_head = (3,7)
- insert old head (4,7) into front → [ (4,7), (4,6) ]
- remove tail (4,6) → body becomes [ (4,7) ]

After move 4: head at (3,7), body is [ (4,7) ]

Move 5: LEFT
- new_head = (2,7)
- insert old head (3,7) into front → [ (3,7), (4,7) ]
- since new_head == apple, do not remove tail. So body becomes [ (3,7), (4,7) ]

So after move 5, the snake is at (2,7), with body segments at (3,7) and (4,7). This makes sense because it's eaten an apple, so the body grows by one segment.

Therefore, in this scenario, the snake successfully moves from (5,5) to (2,7) without overlapping itself, as each move only keeps the previous segment unless it eats an apple. So the path is:

(5,5) → (4,5) [body now has (5,5), but after moving and removing tail, body is empty]

Wait no—this simulation seems conflicting.

Actually, perhaps the initial step-by-step was correct up to move 5, with the body segments correctly following. So in each move, except when eating an apple, the snake's body length remains the same by adding one segment at front and losing one at tail.

Therefore, after five moves (all non-apple), the snake has a body of two segments: [ (3,7), (4,7) ], head at (2,7). So it hasn't overlapped itself because each move only keeps track of the necessary segments without revisiting previous positions except when eating.

Thus, in this case, moving five times from (5,5) to (2,7) with two body segments would not result in collision, as the path is linear and doesn't loop back on itself.

Therefore, the answer is that it's possible, and the final position is (2,7).
</think>

To determine whether the snake can move from (5,5) to (2,7) without overlapping itself, we simulate each move step by step, ensuring the body segments do not collide with themselves.

1. **Move 1**: LEFT
   - New head: (4,5)
   - Body after inserting old head: [(5,5)]
   - Remove tail: Body becomes empty.
   
2. **Move 2**: UP
   - New head: (4,6)
   - Body after inserting old head: [(4,5), (5,5)] → then remove tail → [(4,5)]

3. **Move 3**: UP
   - New head: (4,7)
   - Body after inserting old head: [(4,6), (4,5)] → then remove tail → [(4,6)]

4. **Move 4**: LEFT
   - New head: (3,7)
   - Body after inserting old head: [(4,7), (4,6)] → then remove tail → [(4,7)]

5. **Move 5**: LEFT
   - New head: (2,7)
   - Body after inserting old head: [(3,7), (4,7)]
   - Since it's eating an apple, do not remove tail.

After five moves, the snake successfully reaches (2,7) without overlapping its body.

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (2, 7). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
