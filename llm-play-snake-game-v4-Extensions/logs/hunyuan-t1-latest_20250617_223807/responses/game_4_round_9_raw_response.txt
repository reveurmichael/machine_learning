========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (9,5) with a body trailing down to (4,2). To reach the apple at (7,3), the snake needs to move left (2 units) and down (2 units). The first move LEFT avoids the body and grid bounds. Subsequent DOWN and LEFT moves navigate around the body, reaching (7,4). A final DOWN move to (7,3) (the apple) is safe as the apple isn't occupied by the body. After eating, the snake can still move legally (e.g., LEFT or DOWN), ensuring no immediate trapping."
