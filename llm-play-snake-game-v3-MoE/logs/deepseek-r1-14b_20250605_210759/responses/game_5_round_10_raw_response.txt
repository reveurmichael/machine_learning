========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (7,9) to eat the apple at (6,9). 

First, I'll look at the current state. The head is at (7,9), which is the top-right corner of the grid. The body cells are [(7,8), (7,7), ..., (7,1)], so the snake is a vertical line along x=7 from y=1 up to y=9. That's quite a long snake.

The current direction is "UP". So, the head can't move "DOWN" because that would be reversing direction. The possible initial moves are "LEFT", "RIGHT", or continue "UP".

The apple is at (6,9), which is directly to the left of the head. So, from (7,9), moving "LEFT" will take the head to (6,9) and eat the apple.

But I need to check for collisions. After moving "LEFT" to (6,9), does this new head position collide with any body cells except possibly the tail? The current body starts at (7,8), so no, because (6,9) is not in the body list. Also, after moving, since we ate the apple, the snake grows by one cell. So the body will now include the old head (7,9) and all previous body cells.

Wait, but when we move "LEFT", the new head is (6,9). The current body is [(7,8), ...], so the new head doesn't collide with any body segments because they are all along x=7. So it's safe to move left immediately.

However, I should also consider whether after eating, there's at least one legal move next turn. After eating, the snake grows, but since the apple was right next to the head, moving left is the only way. But then, what directions are possible? The direction after eating would be "LEFT", so next move can't reverse, meaning we can't go back to "RIGHT". So from (6,9), possible moves are "UP" or "DOWN" or "LEFT" again.

But since there's an apple at (6,9) and the snake is now longer, I think moving left is safe for the first step.

The snake can safely move LEFT to eat the apple without any collision risks. 

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) directly reaches the apple without any collision as no body part occupies that cell."
}
