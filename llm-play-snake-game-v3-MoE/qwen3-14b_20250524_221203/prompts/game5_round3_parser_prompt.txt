You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (6,4), and the apple is at (9,4). The current direction is DOWN, and the body has one segment at (6,5). So the snake is currently moving downward. Wait, the head is at (6,4), and the body is at (6,5). That means the snake is going down, right? Because the head is at (6,4), and the next body part is (6,5), which is directly above the head. So the snake is moving downward, and the body is following.

The apple is at (9,4), which is three units to the right of the head. Since the head is at (6,4), moving right three times would get to (9,4). But I need to make sure that the path is safe. Let's think about the current body positions.

The body is [(6,5)], so when the snake moves, the body will shift. Let's consider each step.

First, the current direction is DOWN. But the user can't reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP. So the first move can't be UP. The options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again? Wait, the current direction is DOWN, so the snake can't move UP next. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. But moving DOWN would take the head to (6,3). However, the body is at (6,5), so when moving down, the new head is (6,3). Then the body would shift. Let's check for collisions.

But the main goal is to reach the apple at (9,4). So moving right seems necessary. Let's see: the head is at (6,4). If the snake moves RIGHT, new head is (7,4). Then the body is updated. The original body was [(6,5)], so inserting the old head (6,4) at the front, making the body [(6,4), (6,5)]. Then since the new head is not on the apple, the tail is removed. Wait, no. Wait, the body list is [(6,5)] (from the input). So when moving, step 3a says insert the old head at the front. So the body becomes [old head, ...]. Wait, the original body is [(6,5)], which is the segment behind the head. So when moving, the new body is [old head (6,4), (6,5)], then if the snake doesn't eat the apple, the tail is removed. So the body becomes [(6,4)]. So after moving right, the body would be [(6,4)]. That's okay.

So moving right first step is possible. Let's check if moving right is allowed. Since the current direction is DOWN, moving right is allowed. So first move RIGHT.

Next, the head is at (7,4). The body is [(6,4)]. Now, the next move. The direction after first move is RIGHT. So the next move can't be LEFT. So possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But the apple is to the right, so moving right again. Let's check if that's possible.

Second move: RIGHT again. New head would be (8,4). Check for collisions. The body is [(6,4)]. So the new head (8,4) is not in the body. So that's okay. After this move, the body becomes [(7,4), (6,4)], then since the new head is not on apple, the tail is removed. So body becomes [(7,4)]. So the snake is now at (8,4) with body [(7,4)].

Third move: RIGHT again. New head is (9,4), which is the apple. Now, check collisions. The body is [(7,4)]. The new head (9,4) is not in the body. So that's safe. Then, since the head is on the apple, the body grows. So the body becomes [(8,4), (7,4)], and the tail doesn't move. So the new body is [(8,4), (7,4)], and the head is at (9,4). Now, after eating the apple, we need to make sure there's a legal move next. Let's think about that. After eating, the snake's head is at (9,4), body is [(8,4), (7,4)]. The next move can't be LEFT (since the previous direction was RIGHT). So possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. But the snake is at (9,4), which is on the right edge of the grid. Moving RIGHT would take it off the grid, so that's invalid. So possible directions: UP or DOWN. So the snake can move up or down. So that's okay. So the path is possible.

So the moves would be RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. Let's check each step again.

First move: RIGHT from (6,4) to (7,4). Body becomes [(6,4)]. No collision.

Second move: RIGHT to (8,4). Body becomes [(7,4)].

Third move: RIGHT to (9,4), which is the apple. Body becomes [(8,4), (7,4)]. Then, after eating, the next move can be UP or DOWN, which are valid.

But wait, what about the body positions during movement? Let me check each step for collision.

First step: moving right, new head (7,4). The body is [(6,4)]. The new head is not in the body. So okay.

Second step: moving right, new head (8,4). The body is [(7,4)]. No collision.

Third step: moving right, new head (9,4). The body is [(8,4)]. No collision. So that's safe.

But wait, the body after the first move is [(6,4)], which is the previous head. Then, when moving again, the body is [(7,4)].

So the path is valid. Therefore, the moves would be ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"].

But wait, the initial direction is DOWN. So when the first move is RIGHT, that's allowed because you can't reverse direction. Since the current direction is DOWN, the next move can't be UP, but RIGHT is allowed.

Yes. So this seems to work. But let me check if there's any collision when moving. For example, when moving right three times, the body is shifting, but none of the positions would overlap with the head during movement.

Another thing to consider: when the snake moves right three times, the body length increases by one when eating the apple. So after eating, the body has two segments. But that's okay.

So the answer is three RIGHT moves. The JSON would be:

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly to the right of the head. Moving right three times safely reaches the apple without collisions."
}

But wait, let me check if the first move is allowed. The current direction is DOWN, and the first move is RIGHT. Since the snake can't reverse direction, which would be UP. So RIGHT is allowed. Yes.

Yes, this seems correct.

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly to the right of the head. Moving right three times safely reaches the apple without collisions."
}

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 5)], to eat the apple at (9, 4).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
