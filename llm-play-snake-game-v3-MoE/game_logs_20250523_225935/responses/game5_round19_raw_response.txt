========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (8,3) to (1,4). The apple is at (1,4), which is 7 steps left and 1 step up from the head. That means I need to move left a lot more than right, and up slightly.

First, since the snake's direction is currently LEFT, but according to the path planning guidelines, I can't reverse on the first move. So my first move has to be something other than RIGHT or DOWN because that would mean reversing from LEFT? Wait no, the rule says if current direction is UP, you can't choose DOWN next and vice versa for LEFT and RIGHT. Since it's currently LEFT, I think moving in any of the four directions except perhaps RIGHT might not necessarily reverse, but maybe the first move after being LEFT could be anything else.

Wait, let me check the rules again: "Cannot reverse": if current direction is UP, can't choose DOWN next; similar for LEFT and RIGHT. So from LEFT, I cannot choose RIGHT as a direction? Or does it mean that if you're moving LEFT now, on your next move, you can't turn RIGHT because they are opposite directions?

Yes, the rule says: "Cannot reverse": If current direction is UP, you may not choose DOWN next; similarly for LEFT and RIGHT. So from LEFT, choosing RIGHT would be a reversal, so it's not allowed.

So my first possible moves are either UP, DOWN, or maybe NONE? Wait, no, NONE isn't an option if I'm moving towards the apple. Let me see: The initial direction is LEFT, but since NONE means not moving at all, which won't help. So from LEFT, can I choose any other direction except RIGHT?

So available moves for first step are UP, DOWN, or NONE? Wait no, because current direction is LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT.

Wait, the rule says: you may not reverse on your next move; so if current direction is LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT. But can I choose any other directions, including LEFT again?

Hmm, but moving left again would make it more towards the apple? Well, no, because (8,3) moving left goes to (7,3), which isn't directly towards (1,4). Maybe that's a detour.

But perhaps first move should be UP or DOWN. Let me think about how many steps I need: moving from x=8 to x=1 requires 7 steps to the LEFT. So maybe after each step, keep going LEFT as much as possible without causing collision with body parts.

Also, since the apple is at (1,4), which is one cell above and seven to the left, so perhaps a straight line path could work if there's space.

But let me look at the current snake state. The head is at (8,3), and the body cells are [(9,3)]. So the tail is at (9,3). The next move can't be into (7,3) because that would make the head collide with the tail? Wait no: The rules say that a collision happens if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when it moves. Since the snake will shift its body after moving.

Wait in this case, initial state:

Body is [(9,3)], which is behind the head (8,3). So current position: (8,3) followed by (9,3).

So if I move LEFT first to (7,3), then insert the head at the front of the body list. Then remove the tail (since not eating apple or after checking collision, but since it's just a regular move). Wait no: according to rule 2, step 2 checks for collision before updating.

So moving to (7,3): is this cell occupied by any BODYi except when the tail moves? Since the body is [(9,3)], which doesn't include (7,3), so it's safe. So after move, head becomes (7,3). Then the new body list would be [(8,3) as the second element], and then remove the last, which was (9,3). Wait no: step 3a says insert old head at front of body list, making the new body list [head (7,3), previous body1 (8,3)], but since we removed the tail only if not eating apple.

Wait in this case, it's a regular move, so after adding new_head to the front, which is inserting (7,3) before (9,3). So body becomes [(7,3), (8,3)]. Then remove the last element because no apple. Wait no: step 3a is "Insert old head at front of BODY ⇒ becomes BODY1". Then if not eating apple, step 3b says to move normally, which means removing tail.

Wait so initial body after inserting new_head (7,3) would be [(7,3), (8,3)]. But the original body was [(9,3)], so when you insert head at front: new body list is [head] + old body, which is [(7,3)] + [(8,3), ... , tail]. Wait no, initial body cells are [ (9,3) ] and it's ordered from behind the head. So when inserting new_head as first element of the body, then adding all previous body segments in order.

Wait no: according to point 2: "Body list is ordered from segment immediately behind the head." So the current body is [(9,3)]. When you insert old head (8,3) at front, the new body becomes [(8,3), (9,3)] before any removal. Then if it's a regular move, we remove the tail.

Wait no: step 2 says to check for collision using the state before body shifts. So in this case, inserting head as (7,3) and then inserting old head at front of current body [(9,3)], making [ (8,3), (9,3) ]? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait no: step 2 is just checking for collisions based on the current state before any movement. So moving to new_head = (7,3). Check if this is outside grid? It's within bounds. Then check if new_head coincides with any body cells except tail when it moves. Since after inserting head and removing tail, the new position would be [new_head] + old_body minus last element.

Wait I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to outline:

Current state:
- Head: (8,3)
- Body: [(9,3)]
So the snake is currently just two cells long: head at 8,3 and tail at 9,3.

When moving LEFT from (8,3) to (7,3):

1. Compute new_head = (7,3).

2. Check collision:
   - Is (7,3) outside grid? No.
   - Is (7,3) in the current body except for tail when it moves?
   The current body is [(9,3)], so no.

So no collision. Then:

3a: Insert old head (8,3) at front of BODY → new_body = [ (8,3), (9,3) ]?

Wait wait, step 2 is before any movement. So the check for collision only considers current body cells except when moving and removing tail.

But in this case, after inserting new_head into the front, if it's not eating apple, then we remove the last element of the body list (the old tail). So the new_body becomes [new_head] + previous_body minus last. Since previous_body was [(9,3)], which has length 1.

So when you insert new_head at front: [ (7,3) ] + [(9,3)] → then remove last element because no apple. So body becomes [(7,3)].

Wait that doesn't make sense for a two-segment snake. If the snake was originally head (8,3), body (9,3). After moving to left and not eating apple: insert new_head (7,3) at front of current body → [7,3], 8,3, then remove tail.

Wait no:

Original body is [(9,3)]. After step a: insert old head (8,3), making the new body list as [(8,3)] + [(9,3)], so two elements. Then since it's not eating apple, we have to remove the last element of the body in step 3b. So after moving, the body becomes [ (8,3) ].

Wait that would make the snake only one cell long? Because new_head is added as first, then old_body was [(9,3)], which when you insert and then pop back to one element?

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding step 3a. Maybe it's not adding to the front but creating a new list with new_head followed by all of the current body.

Wait no: according to rule 4:

Each move proceeds as follows:
- Compute new_head.
- Check for collision.
- Update body positions (assuming no collision and within bounds):
   - Insert old head at front → becomes BODY1
   - If not eating apple, remove last element → so the body is [new_head] + current_body minus last.

So with initial body [(9,3)], after moving left:

- new_head = 7,3.
- Insert into front of body: now new_body is [(8,3), (9,3)]?
Wait no. Wait step 3a says insert the old head at the front of the BODY list.

So current body before movement was [(9,3)]. So after inserting new_head (8,3) as first element, new_body becomes [ (8,3), (9,3) ].

Then if not eating apple, we remove the last element: so the new_body is [ (8,3) ].

Wait that would mean the snake's body only has head at 8,3 and no rest? That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body list works.

Alternatively, maybe step 3a says to insert old_head into the front of the body before any changes, then in step b if not eating apple, remove last element.

So initial body is [ (9,3) ] → length 1.

After inserting new_head at front: body becomes [ (8,3), (9,3) ] → length 2.

Then since it's a regular move, we have to remove the tail. So we pop the last element of current body, which is (9,3). So new body list after step 3b would be [ (8,3) ]? That seems like an inconsistency because you inserted two elements and then removed one.

Alternatively, maybe I should think that step 3a inserts the old head into the front, making it part of the body, but since we are not removing anything yet, the body becomes longer by one. Then in step 3b, if no apple, we remove last element (the tail). So:

Initial body: [9,3].

Step a: insert new_head =8,3 → body becomes [8,3,9,3].

Step b: since not eating apple, remove last → body is now [8,3].

So the snake's length goes from 2 to 1? That doesn't make sense. It should be moving forward and growing.

Wait maybe step a adds new_head at front of the current body list (so making it longer), then in step b, if not eating apple, we remove last element (the tail) which is still part of the snake's current position except for the head that was just moved. So after inserting 8,3 into [9,3], making [8,3,9,3], and then removing 9,3 because it's the previous tail.

So new body list would be [ (8,3) ]? That seems incorrect.

I'm getting confused here; maybe I should try to visualize this:

Current state:
- Head: A(8,3)
- Body: B(9,3)

After moving LEFT from A to C(7,3):

1. Compute new_head = C.
2. Check collision with any body cells except when tail moves.

Since current body is [B], which is (9,3). So as long as C != B's position, no collision.

Assuming that's okay, then:

- Insert A at front of current body → becomes [A,B].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → so new_body = [A].

So after movement, the snake would have head at (7,3) and no other segments? That can't be right because a snake needs to have multiple segments.

Wait maybe I'm missing something here. If step 3a is adding new_head as the first element of current body list, which was [B], so it becomes [A,B]. Then if not eating apple (step 3b), we remove last → [A].

But then when checking for collision in step 2: after moving to C, the position would be:

new_head =C(7,3)

body after inserting A is [A,B] and then removing B as tail.

So body becomes [A], which is head at (8,3). So the snake's new state is:

Head: C(7,3), Body: [A](8,3).

Wait that would make the snake go back to where it was before. That seems like a loop or something wrong with my understanding.

I think I'm getting tangled because I don't fully grasp how the body list works in each step.

Perhaps another approach is better. Let's consider moving towards (1,4) as much as possible without causing collision.

Since from head(8,3), we need to go left seven times to x=1 and up once to y=4.

But since we can't have the snake body overlapping itself or other parts except when necessary, perhaps a path that goes straight left as far as possible is feasible.

So initial direction is LEFT. But next move cannot be RIGHT because of rule 3 (can't reverse). So after first step:

Move to (7,3).

Check for collision: since the snake was at (8,3) and body [9,3], moving to (7,3) which isn't occupied by any body part.

Then update body list as follows:

- Insert old head(8,3) in front → new body is [(8,3), 9,3]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element: new body becomes [ (8,3) ]

But then the snake's head would be at (7,3), and body is [8,3]. So it seems like a loop.

Wait maybe that suggests my calculation is wrong. Maybe inserting 8,3 in front of current body list which was [9,3], making new body [(8,3), 9,3], then since not eating apple, we remove last element (9,3) → so the snake's body becomes [8,3].

But then when you move to (7,3), your next step would insert 7,3 at front of current body which is [8,3] → new body [(7,3), 8,3]. Then if not eating apple, remove last: so body becomes [7,3].

So the snake's head is now at (6,3). Hmm.

But maybe this isn't practical. Perhaps a better approach is to plan a path where each move extends the snake towards (1,4) without overlapping itself.

Alternatively, if we can make turns when necessary.

Wait but according to point 2 in movement rules: "If moving towards the apple will result in collision with one of its body segments after moving", then you have to choose another direction.

So perhaps I need to find a path where each step moves closer without causing future collisions.

Alternatively, maybe if I alternate directions slightly to avoid blocking myself.

Wait but with initial head at (8,3) and current snake having only two cells: [9,3], moving straight left as much as possible may cause overlapping when the snake's body grows. So perhaps it can't go all the way left without turning up or down.

Alternatively, maybe move in a serpentine pattern.

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should consider plotting each step and checking for collisions carefully.

Let me try to sketch out the first few steps:

Current state:
- Head: (8,3)
- Body: [(9,3)]

First move options (excluding NONE since it doesn't help):

UP: new_head =7,4

DOWN: new_head=9,4 → but 9 is within grid.

LEFT: 7,3

RIGHT: can't do because current direction is LEFT; so next move cannot be RIGHT.

So first possible moves are UP or DOWN or LEFT.

Let me see which of these would cause collision:

If I go UP to (7,4):

- Is this cell occupied in the body? Current body is [9,3], which doesn't include (7,4), and since we're moving before updating, it's safe.
- Then update: insert old head(8,3) at front of current body → new_body = [(8,3), 9,3]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → new body is [8,3].

So after this move:

Head:7,4

Body:[8,3]

But wait, the snake's head would be moving to (7,4). So in terms of the body list, it's as if the snake has moved forward one cell and shifted. But since its body was only [9,3], after inserting 8,3 at front, then removing last element becomes just [8,3].

This seems like the snake is getting shorter which isn't possible.

Wait that can't be right because the snake should have a consistent number of segments unless it's moving towards apple and growing. So perhaps when you eat an apple, the body grows by adding another segment before the head? Or maybe I've misunderstood how the body list works.

Alternatively, perhaps my approach to visualize this is flawed, and I need to think differently.

Let me try a different angle: since the snake can only move forward one cell at a time, always towards the apple when possible. But in order to do that without getting caught by its own body, we need to ensure each step does not cause collision with any part of itself except possibly the tail if it's about to be removed.

So from (8,3), moving left is safe because there are no other segments except [9,3]. So move LEFT to (7,3):

Check for collision: new_head =7,3. Current body after inserting old_head(8,3) would make the new_body as [(8,3), 9,3], then remove last → [8,3].

Wait but in reality, moving from head at 8,3 to tail at (9,3): so when you move LEFT, head becomes 7,3. The body was originally at 9,3 and next cell is nothing because it's the tail.

But according to rule step 2: when new_head =7,3:

Check if any of current body cells except when moving cause collision. Current body before movement is [ (9,3) ]. So inserting old head(8,3), so new_body before removing tail would be [(8,3), (9,3)]. Since it's not eating apple, we remove last → new_body = [8,3].

So now the snake has only one segment: from 7,3 to 8,3? That seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps this is an error in my reasoning because when you move into a cell, you are adding your body part there. So moving LEFT adds (7,3) as the new head, and since previous body was [9,3], which becomes one segment behind it.

Wait maybe step 2 is: after moving to new_head=7,3, check if any of the current body parts except tail would cause collision.

But in this case, current body only has (9,3). So as long as (7,3) != (9,3), which is true, so no collision. Then step 3a: insert old_head(8,3) into front → new_body = [ (8,3), (9,3) ]. Since not eating apple, step 3b removes last element → body becomes [ (8,3) ].

But now the snake is only one cell? That can't be because it was two cells before. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how inserting and removing works in terms of adding to the body list.

Wait maybe when you insert into front, the number increases by 1, then step b removes last → net change is zero? Or does step a add without increasing total length?

Alternatively, perhaps "inserting" just adds as if it's part of the body but only gets removed in step 3b. So each move would cause the snake to gain one segment when moving towards apple.

Wait let me re-examine steps:

After moving into new_head (without collision), step a: insert old_head at front, making new_body longer by one. Then if not eating apple, remove last element → net change is zero. So body length remains same as before the movement.

But that can't be because when you move towards apple and eat it, perhaps in future steps you'll have to grow more.

Wait maybe each time we move into a new cell without eating an apple, the snake doesn't grow; but if moving towards apple (eating), then the tail is added? Or something like that.

But from step 3 description: "If moving towards the apple will result in collision with one of its body segments after movement, it should not make that move."

Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each time you successfully move without eating an apple, your snake's length remains same because when you insert old_head and then remove last.

But if you eat an apple (which is moving into a new cell where there's an apple), then step 4 would add the apple to the body list?

Wait in any case, I think my confusion lies in how exactly the body list changes with each movement. It might be better to look for alternative resources or try to model this differently.

But given that, maybe it's best to proceed step by step carefully:

Current position: head (8,3), body [(9,3)].

First move options without apple: UP, DOWN, LEFT; RIGHT is prohibited due to current direction being LEFT and can't reverse next move.

So let me try moving UP first:

Move to (7,4):

Check collision with any of the current body parts except tail after movement. Current body before movement is [9,3], which doesn't include 7,4 → safe.

Insert old head(8,3) at front → new_body = [(8,3), 9,3].

Since not eating apple (no apple eaten yet), remove last element → body becomes [8,3].

So after this move:

Head:7,4

Body:[8,3]

This seems like the snake is now moving left and up? Wait that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps in terms of direction, moving UP makes head at (7,4), but body from 8,3. So effectively, the snake's next step would be towards apple?

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this again.

Perhaps it's better to try going straight LEFT without any turns first and see if it works:

First move: LEFT → (7,3)

Check collision: new_head is(7,3). Current body after movement before removing tail is [8,3,9,3]. Then remove last element because not eating apple. So snake becomes 7,3;8,3.

Wait now the body list is [(8,3)]? That seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps my approach to visualizing this is incorrect and I should instead focus on implementing a simple version of this movement where each step inserts the head at front and removes tail unless moving towards apple.

Given that, maybe it's best to follow a path directly towards (1,4) as much as possible:

From (8,3), trying to move left until x=1. So 7,3;6,3;5,3;4,3;3,3;2,3;1,3.

Then from each position, try moving up one step to y=4 at the respective x-coordinate.

So movement steps:

Move LEFT seven times to reach (1,3), then move UP once to (1,4).

But need to check if any of these moves would cause collision with body parts before updating.

Also, considering that after each LEFT move, the snake's body changes as per step 3a and 3b.

Alternatively, perhaps moving straight left until x=1 is possible without overlapping. Since during this time, the tail remains at (9,3) or wherever it was prior to movement.

Wait but if I'm moving from (8,3) to (7,3), the body becomes [8,3] after removal of 9,3? So when you move again to (6,3):

- Check collision: new_head=6,3. Current body is [(8,3)] → which doesn't include it.

So step a: insert old_head(7,3) at front → [7,3,8,3]

Then step b: since not eating apple, remove last element → [7,3].

Wait now the snake's head is moving to 6,3 and body becomes[7,3]. Hmm.

This seems like a problem because each LEFT move makes the snake lose one segment. If you start with two segments, after first LEFT, it becomes one; then next LEFT makes it zero? That can't be.

Therefore, my initial understanding must be wrong about how the body list is managed during movement.

Perhaps another approach: when moving in a direction that doesn't involve eating an apple, each move adds a segment at front and removes last. So net change is zero—so snake length remains same.

But from first step:

Start with head (8,3), body [(9,3)] → 2 segments

Move LEFT to (7,3):

Step a: insert old_head(8,3) into front → new_body = [8,3,9,3]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element→ body becomes[8,3].

So now the snake is two segments again.

Wait that makes more sense. So each move where you don't eat an apple just shifts the body list by one and doesn't change length.

Thus:

After moving LEFT from (8,3):

- New head:7,3

Body after step a: [8,3,9,3]

Step b: since not eating apple → remove last→ body becomes[8,3].

So now snake is two segments: 8,3 and previous front.

Wait but wait that's confusing. After moving left once:

Snake has head at7,3, and its body starts from 8,3? So the tail would be back to where it was?

Hmm... perhaps it's better not to get bogged down in this simulation since each movement seems like an oscillation.

Alternatively, maybe a different initial move. For instance, if first step is UP to (7,4):

Check collision: new_head=7,4; current body [9,3], which doesn't collide.

Step a: insert old_head(8,3) into front → body becomes [(8,3), 9,3]

Since not eating apple, remove last→ body becomes[8,3].

Then after this move:

Head is at7,4

Body is [8,3]

So the snake has two segments again.

This seems inconsistent. Maybe I need to proceed with code-like steps rather than visualizing each movement.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find an algorithm or strategy for navigating towards the apple without self-collision.

Given that, maybe I should try moving in a spiral pattern or making right-angle turns when necessary while ensuring no collisions occur.

But since time is limited and this might be too complex, perhaps it's best to outline steps where each movement is checked for collision with current body (excluding tail) after the move. If safe, proceed; else, change direction.

Thus, here are tentative step-by-step instructions:

1. From head at(8,3), check if moving in LEFT direction would result in a collision.

2. Since no other segments besides [9,3], moving LEFT is safe.

3. Perform LEFT move: new_head=7,3

4. Update body: insert old_head(8,3) into front of current body→ [(8,3), 9,3]

5. Remove last element since not eating apple → body becomes[8,3]

6. Now head is at7,3.

Repeat steps for next moves:

Move LEFT to6,3:

Check if collision: new_head=6,3; no current body segments except [8,3] (from step 5's body list). So safe.

Insert old_head(7,3) into front → [(7,3), 8,3]

Remove last→[7,3]

Now head at6,3.

Move LEFT to5,3:

Check collision: new_head=5,3; no conflict with current body [7,3].

Proceed:

Insert old_head(6,3) into front → [(6,3),7,3]

Remove last→[6,3]

Head now at5,3.

Continue this until x reaches1. Then adjust y accordingly.

But each time moving LEFT, the snake's body is adjusted to [old_head, ...].

Wait but as you move left multiple times, the head moves further left, and the body shifts accordingly. However, when you reach x=1, then perhaps moving up becomes necessary.

At position(1,3):

Move UP to (1,4).

Check collision: new_head=(1,4); current body after step a is [old_head, previous segments].

Assuming that each movement appends old_head and removes last:

After several LEFT moves, at x=1, head is1,3.

Then move UP.

Current body before moving to(1,4): [ (previous head), ... ]

Check collision: new position not on current body → safe.

Insert old_head into front→ [(new head 1,4), previous head]

Since moving towards apple, perhaps the snake needs to add an apple segment? Or is it sufficient to proceed?

Wait step after movement:

If moving to(1,4) and there's no collision, then new_body is [ (old head before move), ... ] but since we added new head at front.

But as per steps 3a-3b: insert old_head into front; if not eating apple, remove last. Since in this case, moving towards apple implies that perhaps the movement includes an apple? Or maybe it's necessary to add a segment only when you eat.

Alternatively, since (1,4) is where the apple is located, I guess moving there would be allowed without collision.

But given time constraints and complexity, the best way forward might be:

Move straight left from(8,3) to x=1, y=3, then move up once to reach (1,4). This should work assuming no self-collision occurs during these movements. Since each LEFT move shifts the body correctly without overlapping.

Therefore, step-by-step instructions are:

1. Move LEFT repeatedly until reaching column 1 at position(1,3).

2. From(1,3), move UP once to (1,4), where the apple is located.
</think>

To navigate from (8,3) to reach the apple at (1,4) without self-collision:

- **Move LEFT** seven times: each time shifting your position one column left and updating body segments by inserting the old head into front then removing the tail except when moving towards the apple.

- Once at (1,3), **move UP** once to reach (1,4).

Thus, the final step-by-step instructions are:

1. Move LEFT until reaching x=1.
2. Then move UP to y=4.

\boxed{(1,4)}
