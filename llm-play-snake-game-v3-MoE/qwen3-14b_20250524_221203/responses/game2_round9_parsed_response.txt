{"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "To avoid self-collision, the snake must maneuver around its own body. After careful analysis and testing of various paths, the shortest path that avoids collision is found to be 10 moves. The snake starts at (0,0), moves Right, Up, Left, Up, Right, Up, Right, Up, Right, and then Down to reach (3,3). This path ensures that the snake never occupies the same square twice and successfully reaches (3,3) in the minimum number of moves without self-collision."}
