"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,5) with a long body occupying the left edge, bottom, and right edge of the grid. To reach the apple at (9,8), the snake first moves UP 4 times to reach (0,9), avoiding the body. It then moves RIGHT 9 times along the top edge (y=9) to (9,9), as these positions are no longer occupied by the body due to tail shifting. Finally, it moves DOWN to (9,8) to eat the apple. This path avoids collisions, respects movement rules, and ensures a safe next move after eating."
