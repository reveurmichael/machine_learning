========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to plan a path for the snake to reach the apple safely. Let me start by understanding all the given information and constraints.

First, the initial state:
- The head is at (1,5).
- Current direction is "UP".
- The body cells are [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)], which means the snake's tail is at (1,2) right now.
- The apple is at (3,7).

I need to find a sequence of directions that will move the head from (1,5) to (3,7) without colliding with itself or the walls. Also, I have to make sure that each move doesn't cause an immediate trap and follows all movement rules.

Let me break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Understanding Movement Rules**

Each move consists of moving the head in one direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) based on the current direction. Then, I have to check for collisions and update the snake's body accordingly.

- **Direction Handling**: The next head position is calculated using the direction vector.
- **Collision Check**: Ensure the new head doesn't go out of bounds or collide with any part of the body except possibly where it will move in this step (if eating apple).
- **Body Update**: After calculating, if the snake eats the apple, the tail doesn't move; otherwise, the tail is removed.

**Step 2: Current State Analysis**

The current head position is (1,5), direction is UP. The body extends from (1,4) to (1,3) and then (1,2). So the snake's current path is a horizontal line at y=5-2? Wait no, let me see:

Wait, the body cells are given as [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)], so each subsequent cell is behind the previous. That means starting from head (1,5), then behind it is (1,4), then (1,3), and tail at (1,2). So the snake's body is a vertical line moving to the right along x=1.

Wait no: Actually, in the example given for movement, when direction was RIGHT, the head moved from (5,5) to (6,5), so it's moving in that direction. But in this case, current direction is UP, which would mean y increases by 1.

So head is at (1,5), direction UP: next position should be (1,6). Let me check if that causes a collision.

**Step 3: Checking Possible Moves**

First move options are limited because the snake cannot reverse immediately. Since current direction is UP, in this initial step, moving DOWN or LEFT or RIGHT might not be allowed? Wait no—rules say you can't reverse on the first move only for the opposite direction. For example, if current direction is UP, next move cannot be DOWN.

Wait rule 2 says: Cannot reverse. So from direction UP, cannot choose DOWN as next move immediately.

But wait, in this case, it's the initial step; I think movement can still proceed as per rules without immediate reversal because it's only for first move. Let me check:

The problem states that current direction is "UP". The rule says: Cannot reverse on the first move. So directions LEFT and RIGHT are allowed if not immediately reversing.

Wait, no—rules say you cannot reverse next turn. For example, moving UP means next step can't be DOWN. But for this initial movement, after choosing UP, next steps would have to avoid DOWN as immediate reversal.

So in this scenario, the first move's direction options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since from current direction UP, moving DOWN is forbidden).

But wait, no—first move could still go any direction except that you can't reverse on the next step. So for example, if I'm going UP now and then choose to go DOWN in the next step, it's allowed because it wasn't the immediate previous.

So back to initial state: current direction is UP; so first move can be UP, LEFT, RIGHT but not DOWN.

Let me evaluate moving UP:

Head moves from (1,5) to (1,6). Check if this is valid.

- Is new_head outside grid? 0<=x<10 and y=6 is within bounds.
- Is new_head on any body cells except the tail's current position?

Current body cells are [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. The new head is at (1,6). Since the snake is moving up along x=1, which was previously occupied by (1,5) as head. But in this case, after moving UP from (1,5) to (1,6), does any body cell block it? No—because body cells are behind; the tail will be at (1,2). So new_head is (1,6), which isn't occupied by any body segments except possibly if a body segment moves into this position. Wait no—the body hasn't shifted yet.

Wait, when moving UP from (1,5) to (1,6):

- The current body cells are [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)].
- new_head is at (1,6). Is this a collision? Since the snake's body is behind it—no. So no collision.

So moving UP seems safe.

If I move UP:

The new body becomes:
- Insert old head (1,5) to the front of the current body list: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)].
- Since it's not eating the apple, remove the tail. The current tail is at (1,2); so after removing, the new body becomes [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].

Wait no—the movement step says:

After moving:
a. Insert old head to front: new body starts with head.
b. If not eating apple, remove last element (tail).

So initial body is [head, body1, body2, body3] = [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)].

After moving UP:

- Insert (1,5) at front: new body starts with (1,5).
But the current head is already in this list. So then it's [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] but since we didn't eat apple, remove last element.

So new body becomes [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].

Wait no—it was previously at position (1,2). So after moving UP and inserting head as (1,5), then removing the tail which is at (1,2)—so yes, new body would be [head: (1,5), body1: (1,4), body2: (1,3)].

Wait no—that's not right. Let me think again:

After moving UP:
- New_head = (1,6)
- Insert old head (1,5) at front of body list: so the new body is [head: (1,5), followed by current body cells [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)].
- Then remove the last element because it's not eating apple. So the new body becomes [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].

So head is now at (1,6); and the rest of the snake is [ (1,4), (1,3) ] with tail at (1,3). Wait no—the tail would be after removing the last element. So body becomes [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]—so head is at (1,5) and the rest follows.

Wait that can't be right because when you move forward, the head moves to a new position, which was vacated by the old head.

So in this movement:

- Old body: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]
After moving UP:
- Insert (1,5) at front of body list → [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] becomes new_body.
But then remove the last element because not eating apple. So new_body is [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].

Wait but after inserting head at front, and removing tail, it's a loop? No—it depends on how movement works.

Actually, in each step:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check collision with body except possible tail.
3. Update body:
   a. Insert old head to front of current body list → this becomes the new body's first part (body segments).
   b. If not eating apple, remove last element (tail) from this new body.

So in step 1: after moving UP, the new_head is (1,6). The current body cells are [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] which excludes the old head (1,5).

Then movement steps:

a. Insert old head (1,5) at front of body list → [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ].
b. Since not eating apple, remove last element: becomes [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ].

Wait no—the current body is [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. When moving UP:

- The new_body after insertion would be [head=(1,5)] followed by the old body: so [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ].
- Then remove last element if not eating apple. So it becomes [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ].

Thus after moving UP:

Head is at (1,6); body cells are [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].

Is that correct? It seems the snake has grown by one segment because it's moving forward. Wait no—the initial body was 3 segments: [head, B1, B2], with tail at B2.

After moving UP:

- Inserting head gives new_body as [head, old B1, old B2].
But then removing last element (tail) since not eating apple—so it becomes [head, old B1].

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the process again.

The snake's body is represented by a list of segments starting from head to tail: current body cells are [(x,y), ... , (tail_x, tail_y)]. Each move:

- Compute new_head.
- Check collision.
- If not eating apple:
   - New body becomes [new_head] + old_body[:-1]
Wait no—it's more like inserting the old head at front and then removing the last element.

In code terms: movement steps would be:

new_body = [new_head] + current_body.copy()

if not eaten:
   new_body.pop()  # remove tail

Thus, for moving UP in initial state:

current_body is [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]
new_head after move is (1,6)
new_body becomes [(1,6)] + [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] → [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]
then remove last element: new_body = [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]

So now the snake's head is at (1,6), body cells are [(1,4), (1,3)], and tail is at (1,3).

Wait no—the movement process:

After inserting old_head into front of current_body, then if not eating apple, remove last element.

Yes, that makes sense. So in the initial move UP from (1,5) to (1,6):

- new_body = [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] → but we have to remove tail if not eating apple.
So after removing last element: [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)].

Therefore, the body is now:

Head at (1,6), then (1,4), (1,3). So when the snake moves again, it will extend forward by one segment each time unless it's growing. Wait no—wait, actually, in this case, because we're moving forward and not eating apple, the body is just shifted.

So after first move UP:

Head: (1,6)
Body cells: [ (1,4), (1,3) ]
Wait but when you insert head at front of current_body which was [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)], so new_body becomes [ (1,5) moved to (1,6?) No, wait—the old head is being moved.

Wait maybe I'm making a mistake in considering the insertion. Let me think again:

The movement step after computing new_head is as follows:

- The current body cells are [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ..., (xn,yn)].
- Inserting the new_head at front: [new_head] + current_body → this becomes the new list of segments including the new head and previous body in order.

If not eating apple:
   Remove last element (tail) from that new list.

So for first move:

current_body = [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]
new_head = (1,6)
Inserting to front: [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]
Then remove last element because not eating apple → becomes [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]

So the new body is [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)].

Therefore, when moving again, the next head position will be based on this new body. So for example, if direction remains UP or changes.

Now, I need to see what's possible after each move regarding not colliding with self and ensuring movement leads towards apple.

Let me try to plot a path from (1,5) to (3,7). The straight line is northeast but the current body is in front. So maybe moving RIGHT first?

Wait, the snake's body is currently at y=2 to 4, x=1, so if I move right towards higher x, that would be away from apple which is at (3,7), so probably not ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps a combination of moves to navigate around the current body and head towards the apple.

Let me try moving UP first as calculated. Let's see:

After first move UP: head at (1,6); body cells [(1,4), (1,3)].

Wait no—after inserting new_head into front and then removing tail if not eating apple, it becomes [new_head] + current_body[:-1]. So in this case, after moving up from (1,5) to (1,6):

current_body is [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. Then:

new_body = [ (1,6) ] + [ (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ][:-1] → [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]

So the new body is [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)].

Thus, next movement would start from head at (1,6); body cells are (1,4) and (1,3). So I can now move UP again? Let's check:

Head: (1,6)
Direction: RIGHT

Wait no—current direction after first move is still UP. Because the initial direction was UP.

So when moving again in direction UP from (1,6), new_head would be (1,7).

Check collision with body cells [(1,4), (1,3)]. No conflict as (1,7) isn't occupied by any of them.

Then movement:

- Insert old head (1,6) at front: [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]
Wait no—it's more accurate to say new_body is [new_head] + current_body[:-1].

Current body before this move was [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)]. After moving UP:

- Insert old head at front: so new_body becomes [ (1,7) ] + [(1,4), (1,3)] → Wait no—current_body is [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)], but after first move.

Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me think step by step.

After initial movement UP:

- Body cells are [ (1,6) ], then the rest of the snake behind it: so body is [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]?

No—the way it works is that after moving forward, you insert your old head into the front of the body list and remove the tail if not eating.

So for first movement:

Current body was [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)].
After moving UP to (1,6):
- new_body = [new_head] + current_body → which is [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]
Then remove last element because not eating apple: becomes [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)].

So after first move:

Body cells are [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]

Thus, the head is at (1,6), body segments behind it at (1,4), then (1,3). So when moving next step in same direction UP:

new_head = (1,7)
Check if any part of current_body blocks this position.

Current_body cells are [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)] → none is at (1,7).

So no collision. Therefore, movement is safe.

Proceeding to move UP again:

After moving to (1,7):

new_body = [ (1,7) ] + current_body[:-1] → [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]

But since we are not eating apple, remove last element: becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4) ]

Wait no—current_body before moving was [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)]. After moving UP:

new_body = [ (1,7) ] + current_body → [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]
Then remove last element: becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4) ]

So now the body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,4)]

Wait no—it's actually:

After moving UP from (1,6):

new_body = [ new_head ] + current_body[:-1]

Which was: [ (1,7) ] + [ (1,6) ]

So the body becomes [(1,7), (1,6)], but wait that can't be right because initial body had three elements before.

Wait no—current_body is a list of segments from head to tail. When you move forward, you insert new_head at front and remove last element if not eating apple.

Thus:

Initial current_body after first UP: [(1,4), (1,3)]
Wait wait—this can't be right because initially the body was [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] → when moving to (1,6):

new_body = [ (1,6) ] + [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)][:-1] → [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ]

So after first UP: body is [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)]

After moving again UP to (1,7):

new_body = [ (1,7) ] + current_body[:-1] → current_body was [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)] → without last element: [ (1,6), (1,4) ]

So new_body is [ (1,7) , (1,6), (1,4) ]

Wait that's three segments.

Yes, because current_body[:-1] for [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)] is [(1,6), (1,4)], so adding new_head gives [ (1,7) ] + [(1,6), (1,4)] → which becomes the new_body.

Then since not eating apple, remove last element? Wait no—only when you are not growing. Because if you're moving forward and not eating, you just shift; but if you eat, you add a segment.

Wait in this case, we are moving to (1,7) without eating, so the body is [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4) ]?

But then the tail was at (1,3). So when inserting new_head at front and removing last element: perhaps it's:

new_body = [new_head] + current_body[:-1]

Which for current_body being [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)] becomes [ (1,7) ] + [(1,6), (1,4)] → resulting in [(1,7), (1,6), (1,4)]

So after moving UP again to (1,7):

Head is at (1,7); body cells are [ (1,6), (1,4) ]

Wait that's only two segments? Or three?

No—when you have:

- current_body before move: [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)]
- after moving to (1,7):
   new_body = [ (1,7) ] + [ (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) ][:-1] → which is [ (1,7) ] + [ (1,6), (1,4) ]
So new_body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,4)]

Thus the body has three segments: head at (1,7), then 6 and 4.

Wait but that would mean after moving UP from (1,6):

- The snake's body is now longer? Or same length?

No—it’s just shifting. Because when you move forward without eating, the tail moves as well.

So in this case:

After first UP: [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)]
After second UP: [ (1,7) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [ (1,7) ] + [(1,6), (1,4)] → so body becomes [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4) ]

So the tail moves from (1,3) to (1,4). So body segments are head at 7, followed by 6 and then 4.

Therefore, when moving UP again, we can check:

new_head would be (1,8)

Check if any of current_body blocks it: which is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,4)]. None are at (1,8) → safe to move.

Proceeding to move UP again:

body before moving was [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4) ]

new_head = (1,8)

new_body becomes [ (1,8) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [(1,8)] + [ (1,7), (1,6) ]

So new_body: [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6) ]

After moving UP again:

Now head at (1,8); body cells are [(1,7), (1,6)]

Wait but that can't be—it's supposed to have three segments. Hmm.

Wait no—current_body before move was [ (1,7), (1,6), (1,4) ]

When moving UP:

new_head = (1,8)

new_body is: [ (1,8) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [(1,8)] + [ (1,7), (1,6) ] → so new_body becomes [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6) ]

Thus after moving UP again:

Head at (1,8); body cells are [ (1,7), (1,6) ]

Wait but that's two segments. That can't be right because the snake has a certain number of segments.

This suggests that perhaps I'm making an error in calculating how many segments there are after each move.

Alternatively, maybe this approach is not working towards the apple and leads to collision later on.

Perhaps moving UP multiple times isn't ideal as it restricts movement.

Let me consider another direction. Maybe turning RIGHT first would help change the snake's orientation so that it can navigate around its current body.

So initial position: head at (1,5), body cells [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]

If I turn RIGHT from UP:

new_head = (2,5)

Check if any part of body is blocking this cell. Current_body cells are [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] → none at (2,5). So safe.

Then movement after moving RIGHT to (2,5):

body becomes [ new_head ] + current_body[:-1] → but since not eating apple:

current_body was [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]

After inserting new_head (2,5) into front and removing last element because not eating:

new_body = [ (2,5) ] + [(1,4), (1,3)] → which is [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

So body after moving RIGHT: head at (2,5); behind it are (1,4) and (1,3). So that's a total of three segments.

Now the snake can move in different directions. Let's see if this helps towards apple.

Apple is at (3,7), so we need to go further right from here.

But current body blocks moving straight down because it has cell at (2,5) and then 4, 3 are above that.

Alternatively, maybe turning DOWN or LEFT?

Wait let me plan the path.

Current direction: RIGHT; head is at (2,5); body cells [(1,4), (1,3)]

So from here:

Option 1: Move UP towards apple's row. But current_head is at y=5, and apple is at y=7.

But movement in UP would take us to (2,6). Check if that's safe.

Body after previous move was [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Check for collision with new head position:

Is any body segment blocking (2,6)?

Current_body cells: [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

None are at (2,6); so moving UP is safe.

Move UP to (2,6):

new_body becomes [ (2,6) ] + current_body[:-1] → [ (2,6) , (1,4), (1,3) ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element: becomes [(2,6), (1,4)]

Wait that can't be right—it's a two-segment body.

Alternatively:

current_body before moving was [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

After inserting new_head at front and removing last element:

new_body = [ (2,6) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,4) ]

Wait no—that doesn't make sense because body is from head to tail.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better represented as new_body being a list where each step of movement shifts the body forward by one segment. So moving UP:

current_body is [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

new_head = (2,6)

insert into front: [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element → becomes [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,4) ]

So body is now [(2,6), (2,5), (1,4)]

Thus, moving UP to (2,6).

Now the snake's direction can be changed.

Perhaps after this, turning LEFT or RIGHT could help navigate around its current position.

But let me check if there are any possible paths towards the apple at (3,7) from here.

Current position:

Head: (2,6)

Body cells: [ (1,4), (1,3) ]

Wait that can't be right because body is [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)] after moving UP. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the new_body.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to approach this problem by thinking about how the snake's body structure and movement can help reach the apple without hitting its own body.

Another thought: The snake has a certain number of segments; if we can move in such a way that each segment moves forward without overlapping previous ones, perhaps we can progress towards the apple.

Alternatively, maybe the snake is currently positioned with head at (2,5), and body above it, so moving further UP would not block, but as y increases, it's approaching the apple.

Wait apple is at (3,7). So if I move to higher y positions:

From (2,6) moving UP: (2,7)

Then from there, perhaps RIGHT towards x=3.

But let me try mapping out this path step by step.

1. Start position after initial right turn:
   - Head: (2,5)
   - Body cells: [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Wait no—after the first move to RIGHT:

- new_head was at (2,5); body becomes [ (2,5) ] + previous_body[:-1] → which is [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

So after moving RIGHT once.

Now let's plan steps from here towards apple at (3,7).

Step 1: Move UP to (2,6)

new_head = (2,6)
new_body becomes:
[ (2,6) ] + [(2,5), (1,4)] → [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,4) ]
But since we're not eating, remove last element: so body is [(2,6), (2,5), (1,4)]

Wait that doesn't make sense because then the third segment should be at 1, which is a different column.

Alternatively, perhaps my approach to calculating new_body is incorrect. Maybe when moving forward without eating, only one segment is added, but in this case, it's not necessary because the snake isn't growing. So body remains the same length except shifting front.

Wait no—the problem says that if you move and don't eat, your position shifts; but since there are three segments after first movement (from initial three), perhaps each move adds one segment or removes?

This is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach would be to model the snake as a list of coordinates in order from head to tail.

Each time it moves forward without eating apple, the new_head is added to the front and last element is removed; thus keeping the same number of segments but shifting each body part accordingly.

So initial position after first UP:

Head at (1,6), body cells: [ (1,4), (1,3) ]

Wait no—initial move was UP from (1,5) to (1,6), and then new_body is [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)]

So when moving further, each step adds one segment at front and removes last.

So moving RIGHT: (2,5), body becomes [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

Then moving UP to (2,6):

new_body = [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,4) ] ?

Wait that would be three segments.

But then from here:

Moving RIGHT again: new_head at (3,6)

Check if any body segment blocks it. Body is [(2,6), (2,5), (1,4)] → no blocking.

Move to (3,6):

new_body becomes [ (3,6) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [ (3,6) , (2,6), (2,5) ]

Then remove last element if not eating apple: so body becomes [(3,6), (2,6)]

Wait but that's two segments. That can't be right.

I'm getting stuck here; perhaps I need to try a different approach.

Alternative plan:

Perhaps the snake is currently positioned with head at (1,5); after moving UP twice, it reaches (1,7). At this point, its body is [(1,6), (1,4), (1,3)], which seems too spread out and may cause collision later on. So maybe moving to the right first would position the snake better.

After initial move RIGHT:

Head at (2,5); body cells [ (1,4), (1,3) ]

Wait no—the previous step after moving RIGHT from (1,5) should have head at (2,5), and body as [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Now perhaps turning LEFT or DOWN could help.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can turn around and use its body to navigate towards the apple by wrapping around itself.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to sketch out each possible move step-by-step, considering direction changes and ensuring no collision with previous body parts.

Another idea: The snake needs to reach (3,7). Since current head is at (2,5), moving UP three times would take us to y=8, which is beyond the apple's y-coordinate of 7. So perhaps we should move RIGHT first to x=3 before going further up in y.

But from (2,5):

Moving RIGHT again:

new_head = (3,5)

Check if any body part blocks it: current_body after initial RIGHT was [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)] → none at (3,5). So safe.

Move to (3,5):

body becomes [ (3,5) ] + [(2,5), (1,4)] → since not eating apple, remove last element: body is [ (3,5), (2,5), (1,4) ]

Now head at (3,5); body cells are [ (2,5), (1,4) ]

Hmm, now from here:

Maybe move UP towards the apple. From y=5 to 6.

new_head = (3,6)

Check body: current_body is [(3,5), (2,5), (1,4)] → none at (3,6). Safe.

Move to (3,6):

body becomes [ (3,6) ] + [(3,5), (2,5)] → remove last element since not eating apple: body becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5)]

Now head is at (3,6); body cells are [ (3,5), (2,5) ]

Next move: UP to (3,7)

Check body for collision: none. So safe.

Move to (3,7):

apple is located here → success!

So the steps would be:

1. Initial position: head at (1,5); body [(1,4), (1,3)]
2. Move RIGHT once:
   - Head at (2,5); body [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]
3. Then move RIGHT again:
   - Wait no—it was moved to (2,5) with body [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]
   But moving right would be increasing x by 1 each time.

Wait from step 2: head at (2,5); body cells [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Then step 3: move RIGHT to (3,5)
- new_head = (3,5)
- body becomes [ (3,5) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [ (3,5), (2,5), (1,4) ]
- remove last element if not eating apple: so [(3,5), (2,5)]
Wait that can't be right because the length changes. Maybe I need to correct my understanding.

Each time you move forward without eating, the body is shifted such that:

new_body = [ new_head ] + current_body[:-1]

Thus, from step 2: current_body after moving RIGHT once was [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

After second RIGHT movement:

new_head = (3,5)

current_body before move: [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

so new_body is [ (3,5) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [ (3,5), (2,5), (1,4) ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element:

new_body = [ (3,5), (2,5) ]

So body now has two segments: head at 3,5; then tail at 2,5.

But that's only two segments. Then when moving to (3,6):

- new_head is (3,6)
- current_body was [(3,5), (2,5)]
- so new_body becomes [ (3,6) ] + [(3,5)] → since not eating apple.
Wait no—if you have a two-segment body:

new_body = [ new_head ] + rest of the body except last segment.

So from previous step: current_body is [ (3,5), (2,5) ]

When moving to (3,6):

new_body becomes:
[ (3,6) ] + [(3,5)] → so now it's two segments again? That can't be right because the length would vary.

Wait I think my confusion arises from how the body is managed when not eating. Perhaps each move without eating results in adding one segment to the front and removing the last segment, keeping the total number of segments constant except for when you eat (which adds a new segment at the end).

So initial after first RIGHT movement:

- head: 2,5
- body: [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)] → three segments

After moving RIGHT again to 3,5:

new_head = 3,5; current_body is [ (2,5), (1,4) ]

Wait no—that would be because from the previous step, body had [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)], and after removing last element when moving without eating, it becomes two segments.

So now:

Step 1: initial at (1,5); body [ (1,4), (1,3) ]

Move RIGHT once to (2,5): new_body = [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Move RIGHT again to (3,5):

new_head is 3,5.

current_body after first move was [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)] → remove last element when moving: becomes [ (2,5), (1,4) ]

so new_body after second move is:

[ (3,5) ] + current_body[:-1] = [ (3,5) , (2,5) ]

Now from here:

current_body is [(3,5), (2,5)]

Next step: moving UP to 3,6.

new_head is 3,6

current_body before move: [(3,5), (2,5)]

so new_body becomes [ (3,6) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [ (3,6), (3,5) ]

since not eating apple.

Now body has two segments: head at 3,6; tail at 3,5.

Next step: move UP to 3,7

new_head is (3,7)

current_body before move: [(3,6), (3,5)]

so new_body becomes [ (3,7) ] + current_body[:-1] → which is [ (3,7), (3,6) ]

Now the apple is at (3,7). So when moving to 3,7, does that mean the snake's head reaches the apple?

Yes.

But wait: when you move into a cell that contains food, do you eat it? Or do you just reach it without eating?

In the problem statement, I think reaching the apple is sufficient—perhaps they don't require eating it to solve the problem. So in this case, moving to (3,7) would position the head at the apple.

Thus, steps are:

1. Start: head (1,5); body [(1,4), (1,3)]
2. Move RIGHT once → (2,5); body [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]
3. Move RIGHT again → (3,5); body becomes [(3,5), (2,5), (1,4)] and then remove last to become [(3,5), (2,5)]
   Wait no—each move adds one segment at front and removes last if not eating.

Wait I think my earlier steps had an error. Let me recount:

Step 1: initial position as given.

Move RIGHT once:
- new_head is (2,5)
- current_body was [ (1,4), (1,3) ]
- new_body becomes [ (2,5) ] + current_body[:-1] → [ (2,5), (1,4) ]

Because when you move without eating, the body length remains same? Or does it change?

Wait perhaps each movement adds one segment but removes one if not eating.

So from initial:

After first RIGHT: head at 2,5; body cells [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

Because moving once adds a segment to front and the last is removed? Or does it add without removal?

Alternatively, perhaps when you move forward without eating, each step involves adding one new segment in front but not removing any unless you eat.

In this case:

Initial body after first RIGHT: [ (2,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]

Now moving to second RIGHT movement:

new_head at 3,5
current_body is [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]
so new_body becomes:
[ (3,5) ] + current_body → which would be four segments? That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe I should model the snake's body as a list where each move adds one segment at front and appends to tail unless it's an eating move, in which case it only adds one new segment without removal.

But given the problem statement says:

"Move your head in some direction."

"If you go into a cell with food, you eat it. Otherwise, you just move normally."

So when not eating, moving is simply shifting forward; hence each movement shifts all body parts by +1 in the direction of movement.

Thus, if the snake has N segments, each move will cause the head to move one step and the rest of the body follows.

Wait no—wait the problem says:

"When you move normally without eating apple, your entire body moves forward."

So it's a matter of the entire body moving in the direction chosen. So from any position, when moving, all body parts shift in that direction by 1 cell.

In this case, each movement is one step in a direction for the entire snake.

Wait but if so, then how does turning affect the path?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it; maybe the problem can be solved by considering the relative positions and ensuring that when moving towards a new position, none of the body cells are occupied except those ahead.

But given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to try to map out the minimal steps needed for the snake's head to reach (3,7) without colliding with its own body.

Based on earlier thought process, it seems that moving RIGHT twice and then UP thrice can get us there:

1. Move RIGHT once → 2,5
   - Body: [2,5], 1,4), (1,3)]
Wait no—after initial move to 2,5 with body cells [(2,5), (1,4), (1,3)]

Then moving RIGHT again → 3,5.

- current_body is [2,5; 1,4; 1,3]
new_head = 3,5
body becomes: [3,5], followed by the first two segments minus last? Or just all previous except last?

Alternatively, maybe each movement adds one segment to front and removes last if not eating.

Thus:

After moving RIGHT twice:

- Body is [(3,5), (2,5), (1,4)]

Then move UP once → 3,6.

- body becomes [ (3,6), (3,5) ]

Move again to 3,7: success.

But the problem is that when we are at 3,5 as head and body cells [(3,5), (2,5)], moving up would require new_head (3,6). current_body is [ (3,5), (2,5) ]

Thus:

new_body = [ (3,6) ] + [ (3,5) ] → which becomes two segments again.

Then from 3,6 to 3,7: same way, body cells are [(3,7), (3,6)]

But apple is at 3,7. So when moving into that cell, whether the snake's head reaches it without collision?

Yes, because in each step:

1. Move RIGHT → position at 2,5
   - body: [2,5; 1,4]
2. Move RIGHT again → 3,5
   - body: [3,5; 2,5; 1,4] but then remove last if not eating: so becomes [3,5; 2,5]
Wait no—maybe with each move, the snake's body is adjusted by adding one segment in front and removing none unless it eats.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step-by-step movement is as follows:

Start:
- Head: (1,5)
- Body cells: [(1,4), (1,3)]

Move RIGHT once → head at 2,5
   - body becomes [2,5; 1,4]
       Because adding one segment in front and removing last if not eating.

Wait but initial length was two segments after first move? I think this is getting too confusing. Maybe it's better to accept that with the initial right moves and then moving up thrice can get us to apple without collision.
</think>

The snake can be navigated by first turning RIGHT twice, positioning its head at (3,5), followed by three UP movements to reach (3,7) where the apple is located.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head starts at (1,5), with body segments [(1,4), (1,3)].
2. **First Move RIGHT**: The head moves to (2,5). The body updates to include this new position in front and removes the last segment behind if not eating food. So, the body becomes [(2,5), (1,4)].
3. **Second Move RIGHT**: The head moves to (3,5). The body is now [(3,5), (2,5)] after adding the new segment without removing any since no food was eaten yet.
4. **First Move UP**: The head moves to (3,6). The body updates to include this position in front and removes the last segment if not eating. So, it becomes [(3,6), (3,5)].
5. **Second Move UP**: The head moves to (3,7) where the apple is located. Since moving into a cell with food might allow the snake to reach it without collision.

Thus, after these steps, the snake's head reaches the position of the apple at (3,7). 

$\boxed{(3,7)}$
