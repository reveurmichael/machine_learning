 {
      "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
      "reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,5) and the apple is located at (3,8). To reach the apple safely, we move right to avoid the adjacent cell occupied by our own body. Then, we proceed in a straight line upwards as there are no obstacles. This path avoids collisions, maintains continuity of the snake's body, and ensures that there is at least one legal move after eating the apple."
