{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"], "reasoning": "The snake starts at position (1,1) with its body segments at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (1,6). The goal is to reach the apple at (6,1). Moving right is the optimal choice, as it avoids collision and progresses directly toward the target. Each subsequent move continues in the same direction until the snake reaches the target."}
