 {
    "moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "DOWN", "RIGHT"],
    "reasoning": "The shortest path to reach the apple is a diagonal movement, but since we cannot reverse direction on the first move and must avoid collisions, we opt for the safer path by moving up once, then left twice, followed by moving down and right. This path ensures that the body remains continuous and avoids hugging walls unnecessarily."
