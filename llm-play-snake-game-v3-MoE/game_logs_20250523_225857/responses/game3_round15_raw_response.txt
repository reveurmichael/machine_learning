========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out a safe path for the snake to eat the apple without dying. Let's start by understanding the current state.

The snake's head is at (7,5), and it's moving to the right because the direction is "RIGHT". The body cells are [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], so the snake is in a straight line going left from the head. The apple is at (4,2), which is quite a bit below and to the left of the head.

First, I should visualize this grid. The head is near the top-right corner, moving right would take it further along x-axis, but since the snake can't reverse direction on the first move, the initial move must be "RIGHT" as given. Wait, no—the problem says the current direction is "RIGHT", so that's the initial move.

Wait, actually, the problem states the direction is currently "RIGHT", so the snake can't change direction immediately. So the first move has to be "RIGHT". But moving right from (7,5) would take it to (8,5). Let me check if that's a valid move.

Looking at the body, the tail is at (3,5), and after the head moves to (8,5), I need to update the body. Since the new head isn't the apple, the snake can't grow, so the tail will move from (3,5) to (2,5). So the body becomes [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], then after moving, it's [(8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. Wait, no—when the head moves right, the old head becomes the first body cell. So the new body is [old_head, ...rest of body except last]. Since we didn't eat the apple, we remove the tail.

But wait, after moving to (8,5), is there an apple at (4,2)? No, so no growth. The snake's body shortens by one segment because the tail moves.

Hmm, but this seems like a long way around. Maybe I should look for a shorter path. Let me think about the Manhattan distance. From (7,5) to (4,2), the horizontal distance is 3 units left and vertical is 3 units down. So total of 6 steps if moving directly. But given the initial direction is "RIGHT", the snake can't turn immediately.

Wait, no—the first move has to be "RIGHT" because that's the current direction. So after the first move to (8,5), the next moves can change direction, but not reverse. Since we started with "RIGHT", the next move could be "DOWN" or continue "RIGHT". But moving further right isn't helpful as it takes us away from the apple.

Alternatively, maybe after moving right once, the snake can start turning down towards (4,2). Let me map out a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT to (8,5).
2. Then move DOWN twice: to (8,4), then (8,3).
3. Then move LEFT three times: to (7,3), (6,3), (5,3).
4. Now at (5,3), check if we can go further down? But wait, the apple is at (4,2). So maybe from (5,3), move left again to (4,3), then down to (4,2).

But I need to make sure that none of these moves cause the head to collide with the body. Also, after eating the apple, we must ensure there's a way to move next turn.

Wait, let me check each step:

After first move: (8,5). Body is [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. Then, moving down from (8,5) to (8,4): safe, as body is at y=5. Next, (8,3): still below the body which is at y=5 and higher.

Then, moving left: (7,3). Now, the body is [(8,5), (7,5), etc.] but after each move, the head is added to the front of the body. So when we get to (5,3), let's see:

At (5,3), check if this is a valid position. The tail was at (4,3) before moving? Wait, no—the tail moves after the head moves.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to simulate each step carefully.

Initial state:
Head: (7,5)
Body: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]
Direction: "RIGHT"

Move 1: RIGHT
New_head = (8,5). Check collisions: it's within grid and not in body except tail. Since the tail is at (3,5) and moving to (2,5), but new head is (8,5), which isn't occupied by any body cell.

So update:
Head becomes (8,5).
Body becomes [ (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]
Since didn't eat apple, remove tail: so new body is [ (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]

Move 2: change direction to DOWN. Since current direction is RIGHT, can we turn? Yes, because the next move isn't reversing. So from RIGHT, you can go DOWN or continue RIGHT.

But moving further right doesn't help. Let's choose DOWN.

New_head = (8,4). Check if this is occupied by any body segment except possibly tail after move.

Current body: [ (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]
So y=4 isn't in the body, so safe.

Update:
Head becomes (8,4).
Body becomes [ (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ] (insert old head)
Since didn't eat apple, remove tail: new body is [ (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) ]

Move 3: DOWN again.
New_head = (8,3). Check if safe. y=3 isn't in body.

Update:
Head becomes (8,3).
Body becomes [ (8,4), (8,5), ... ] after inserting old head.

Remove tail if not eaten: so new body is [ (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) ]

Now at (8,3). Next possible move: LEFT or continue DOWN. Let's try LEFT to start moving towards the apple.

Move 4: LEFT
New_head = (7,3).

Check if safe. y=3 isn't in body except possibly tail. Body is [ (8,5), ..., (5,5) ], so no collision.

Update:
Head becomes (7,3).
Body becomes [ (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5) ]

Since didn't eat apple, remove tail: new body is [ (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5) ]

Move 5: LEFT again
New_head = (6,3). Safe.

Update:
Head becomes (6,3).
Body becomes [ (7,3), (8,3), ..., (6,5) ]

Remove tail: new body is [ (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5) ]

Move 6: LEFT
New_head = (5,3). Safe.

Update:
Head becomes (5,3).
Body becomes [ (6,3), (7,3), ..., (6,5) ]

Remove tail: new body is [ (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5) ]

Now at (5,3). Next move: LEFT to (4,3).

Move 7: LEFT
New_head = (4,3). Check if safe. y=3 isn't in body except possibly tail.

Update:
Head becomes (4,3).
Body becomes [ (5,3), (6,3), ..., (6,5) ]

Remove tail: new body is [ (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5) ]

Now at (4,3). Next move: DOWN to reach the apple.

Move 8: DOWN
New_head = (4,2). This is the apple!

Check collision: safe because it's within grid and not occupied by any body segment except possibly tail. But since we're eating the apple, the tail doesn't move this turn.

Update:
Head becomes (4,2).
Body becomes [ (5,3), (6,3), ..., (7,5), (6,5) ] with the old head inserted at front.

But wait, when eating the apple, do we add a new segment? Yes. So after eating, the body grows by one. So new body is:

[ (4,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5) ]

Wait, no. The old head was (4,3). After inserting it at front of the body, which is [ (5,3), ..., (6,5) ], we get:

[ (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5) ]

Then since we ate the apple, we keep all body segments and add the new head. So:

[ (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (6,5) ]

But the problem is, after eating the apple, the snake can't move back immediately if it wants to continue, but here the next move is not an issue because we're done.

Wait, no—the problem requires that after eating the apple, you need to have a valid move. Since the last move was to (4,2), which is the apple, and now the head is there. The body would be [ ... , (6,5) ] with (4,3) inserted.

But for the next move, from (4,2), can we go DOWN again? No, because y=2 is the lowest. Alternatively, move LEFT or RIGHT.

Wait, but after eating the apple, the tail doesn't move this turn, so the snake's body would be:

[ (4,2), (5,3), ..., (6,5) ]

But wait, no—the old head was (4,3). When moving to (4,2), you insert the old head at front: [ (4,3), ...rest of body except last... ]. Since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So new body is:

[ (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5) ]

And the head is at (4,2). Then, for the next move, from (4,2), can we move LEFT or RIGHT?

But wait, to get there, you have to make sure that the path doesn't collide with the body. So if from (4,2), moving LEFT would be to (3,2), which is clear.

So yes, after eating the apple, you can still move left or right without issues.

Therefore, the sequence of moves is:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. LEFT
5. LEFT
6. LEFT
7. LEFT
8. DOWN

Wait, no—step 3 was another DOWN? Let me recount:

After initial direction "RIGHT", first move: to (8,5).

Then three more moves down to (8,3). Then left four times to (4,3), then down once to (4,2).

That's a total of 8 moves.

But wait, I think I missed the steps. Let me list them again:

1. RIGHT: (7,5) → (8,5)
2. DOWN: (8,5) → (8,4)
3. DOWN: (8,4) → (8,3)
4. LEFT: (8,3) → (7,3)
5. LEFT: (7,3) → (6,3)
6. LEFT: (6,3) → (5,3)
7. LEFT: (5,3) → (4,3)
8. DOWN: (4,3) → (4,2)

Yes, 8 moves.

Alternatively, is there a shorter path? Let's see:

Another approach could be to go down first before moving left, but since initial direction is "RIGHT", you can't do that immediately. So the snake must make two consecutive "DOWN" moves after the initial right move.

So the path seems correct. Now, I need to ensure that none of these steps cause a collision with the body except when eating the apple.

At each step before eating, the head is not colliding with any body segment.

Yes, because we're always moving in such a way that the head is either at the end or next to the body, but since we're not growing until the last move, the tail moves left each time.

Wait, no—the snake's body is shortening by one each time except when eating the apple. So as the snake moves, it's effectively following itself without overlapping.

Yes, I think this path works.
</think>

The shortest path for the snake to reach the apple, considering the initial direction and movement constraints, is:

1. Move RIGHT to (8,5)
2. Move DOWN twice to (8,3)
3. Move LEFT four times to (4,3)
4. Move DOWN once to (4,2)

**Answer:** The snake can move right, down twice, left four times, and then down once to reach the apple.

The path is: RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN.

So, the moves are: \boxed{RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN}
