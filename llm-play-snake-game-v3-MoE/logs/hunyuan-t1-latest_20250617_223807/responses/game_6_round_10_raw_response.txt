========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left twice (from x=8 to x=6) and down once (from y=5 to y=4) to reach the apple. Starting with LEFT avoids reversing direction (current direction is DOWN) and moves closer to the apple's x-coordinate. Subsequent LEFT and DOWN moves continue toward the target, avoiding body collisions. After eating the apple, the snake has legal moves (e.g., LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) to avoid trapping."
