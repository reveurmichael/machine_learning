<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (0,1), and the apple is at (2,6). My goal is to find a safe path for the snake to reach the apple without causing any collisions and following all movement rules.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake. The head is at (0,1), and the body cells are [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]. So the snake's body extends from (1,1) to (3,4). The current direction is "LEFT", which means the head was moving towards decreasing x-values. But since the next move can't reverse, I can't go RIGHT if the current direction is LEFT.

The apple is at (2,6), which is two units to the right and five units up from the head's current position. So, the Manhattan distance is 7, but considering directions, we need to figure out a path that avoids the body segments and walls.

Looking at the body cells, I see that moving directly up might be blocked by some of these segments. The body is spread out along x=1 to x=4 on y=1, then starts moving up from (4,2) onwards. So, if I move straight up, I need to make sure that none of the body cells are in the way.

Let's plan a path:

1. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But moving LEFT from (0,1) would take the head out of bounds because x= -1 isn't allowed. So, options are UP or DOWN.

Wait, but according to movement rules, if current direction is LEFT, I cannot choose RIGHT next. So, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But moving LEFT from (0,1) would take the head to (-1,1), which is outside the grid, leading to death. So, that's not allowed.

Therefore, initial options after "LEFT" direction are UP or DOWN.

But looking at the current state, if I move UP from (0,1), new_head becomes (0,2). Is this position safe?

Checking body cells: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]. So (0,2) is not part of the current body. Wait, no—body starts from (1,1), so (0,2) is outside the body segments. But wait, when moving UP to (0,2), we need to check if this position coincides with any BODYi except possibly the tail.

Wait, the tail is at (3,4). So, in the current move, when checking for collision, new_head should not coincide with any BODYi except the tail's current cell only if that tail will move this turn. Wait, no—the rule says:

"If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn"

So in the initial move, when we choose a direction, the body is fixed until after the movement. So, for the first move, moving UP to (0,2), I need to check if this position is in the BODY list. The BODY list starts at (1,1) and goes up to (3,4). So, no, (0,2) isn't part of the body, so it's safe.

So, first move could be UP to (0,2).

Next, after moving UP, the head is now (0,2), direction is still UP since we chose that as the next direction. But wait, movement can change direction each time unless it's reversing. Wait, no—the current direction is the previous one. So, if I move UP first, then my current direction becomes "UP".

Wait, no: in each step, the direction chosen for the move defines the new head position and also sets the new direction.

So, let's outline:

1. Initial state:
   - Head: (0,1)
   - Direction: LEFT
   - Body cells: [(1,1), (2,1), ..., (3,4)]

First move options after LEFT are UP or DOWN because we can't go RIGHT immediately.

Option 1: Move UP to (0,2). Let's see:

- New head: (0,2)
- Check collision: (0,2) is not in body cells, so safe.
- Update body:
   - Insert old head (0,1) at front of BODY → [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), ... , (3,4)]
   - Since new_head != apple position, remove tail. The current apple is at (2,6), so not eaten yet.
   - Remove the last body cell, which was (3,4). So the new body becomes [(0,1), (1,1), ..., (4,2)].

But wait, after moving UP and adding the old head to the front, the body would be [ (0,1) ] followed by the rest. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail. So initial body is length 8; after move, it remains 8. Wait no: original body is 8 cells. After moving, inserting the old head makes it 9, then removing the tail brings it back to 8.

Wait, more accurately:

- Original S is [ (0,1) ] + body list [(1,1), ... , (3,4)] → total of 9 segments including head.
Wait no: original HEAD is (0,1), and the body cells are 8 segments. So total length is 9.

After moving UP:

- New_head = (0,2)
- Insert old head (0,1) into the front of the body list → new body starts with (0,1), followed by (1,1), etc.
But wait, according to movement update rules:

a. Insert the old head position at the front of the BODY list → so after inserting, the new_body_before_eating is [old_head] + current_BODY.

So in this case, after moving UP, the new body would be [(0,1)] + [(1,1), (2,1), ..., (3,4)] → 9 elements. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail (the last element) → 8 elements again.

So the updated S is [ (0,2) ] + [ (0,1), (1,1), ..., (4,2) ].

Wait no: after inserting old head at front of BODY, which was [(1,1)...], it becomes [old_head] followed by body. Then, remove tail if not eating apple. So the new body is [old_head] + current_body[:-1].

So for this first move:

- After moving UP:
   - New head: (0,2)
   - Body becomes [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), ..., (4,2) ] → length 8.

Now, the direction is now "UP", because we chose that as the next move.

Next step: from (0,2). Current direction is UP. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN? No—wait, movement rules say you cannot reverse direction immediately. Current direction is UP; so next move can't be DOWN.

So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again.

But wait, no: the rule says you cannot choose the opposite direction. So if current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN". Similarly for others. So from UP, you can go LEFT, RIGHT, or stay in UP.

Wait, no—the movement rules state:

2. **Cannot reverse**: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT".

So if current direction is UP, cannot choose DOWN next move.

In this case, after moving UP to (0,2), the current direction becomes UP, so next moves can't be DOWN.

Now, from (0,2), what's possible?

Possible directions: LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again.

But let's see:

If I go UP again to (0,3):

- Check collision: is (0,3) in body? Current body after first move is [(0,1), (1,1), ..., (4,2)]. So (0,3) is not part of the body. Safe.

Then proceed similarly.

But perhaps a better approach is to find a path that leads towards the apple without getting blocked by the body.

The apple is at (2,6). The Manhattan distance is 2 right and 5 up.

So overall, we need to move mostly UP and some RIGHTs.

Let me think about possible moves:

Option: Move UP first, then LEFT or something else. But wait, from (0,1), moving UP to (0,2) seems logical as it starts the movement upwards.

But perhaps an alternative approach is needed because moving directly up might lead into the body segments later on.

Wait, let's consider the snake's body after each move:

After first move UP: new head at (0,2). Body becomes [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), ..., (4,2)].

Second move options are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again. Let's choose UP to (0,3):

- New head: (0,3)
- Check collision: not in body.
- Update body: insert (0,2) at front → [(0,2), (0,1), ... , (4,2)]
- Remove tail → new body is [ (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), ..., (4,2) ].

Wait, no—the body after first move was [ (0,1), (1,1), ... , (4,2) ]. After second move UP:

- Insert old head (0,2) at front → new body is [ (0,2) ] + [ (0,1), (1,1), ..., (4,2) ]
- Then remove the tail because we didn't eat apple. So the new body becomes [ (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), ... , (3,2) ]

Wait, original body after first move was 8 segments: [(0,1), (1,1), ..., (4,2)]. When inserting old head (0,2), the new body becomes [ (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), ... ].

Wait no: initial body after first move is [(0,1)] + [(1,1), ..., (3,4)], which is 9 segments? Wait, no. Original body cells are 8 elements, plus the head makes it 9.

But perhaps I'm complicating this; maybe a better approach is to simulate each step carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the first move should be DOWN instead of UP.

From (0,1), current direction LEFT; possible moves are UP or DOWN.

If I move DOWN from (0,1) to (0,0):

- Check collision: (0,0) is not in body cells.
- Update body: insert old head (0,1) at front → [(0,1)] + [ (1,1), ..., (3,4) ]
- Remove tail since no apple eaten. So new body becomes [ (0,1), (1,1), ..., (3,2) ].

Then, direction is DOWN now.

From (0,0), next move can't be UP because current direction is DOWN; we can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

But moving further down may take us away from the apple. So perhaps UP is better.

Alternatively, let's try to plan a path that moves right and up, but without reversing directions too quickly.

Another approach: After initial move, start moving towards the apple by gradually increasing x (right) while moving up in y.

But considering the body's position, which spans from x=1 to x=4 on y=1, it might be better to go around that area.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the body moves as we proceed. Each time we move, the head moves, and the tail follows unless we eat something (which doesn't happen in this case).

So after each move, the body shifts forward by one cell, with the new head added at the front and the last cell removed.

Given that, perhaps moving towards the right initially would allow us to get around the body segments blocking our path upwards.

Wait, but from (0,1), moving LEFT is not possible because x=0-1=-1 is invalid. So first move can't be LEFT. Current direction is LEFT; next moves can't be RIGHT immediately.

But if we move UP or DOWN.

Let me try a different approach: simulate the initial moves step by step to see where collisions might occur.

First move options after LEFT are UP or DOWN.

Option A: Move UP to (0,2).

Then, second move from (0,2) can be UP, RIGHT, or LEFT? No—current direction is UP; can't go DOWN next. So options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

If I choose UP again:

- New head: (0,3)
- Check collision: not in body.
- Insert old head (0,2) at front of body → new body starts with (0,2), followed by previous body except the tail.
- Continue moving UP until we reach y=6.

But let's see where that leads:

After several UP moves, the head would reach (0,6). But to get to (2,6), we need to move RIGHT as well.

However, after each UP move, the body follows. So if I keep moving UP, the body will be stretched upwards, potentially blocking our path.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving UP a few times, turn right.

But let's think: after first move UP to (0,2), second move can't be DOWN.

If from (0,2), we choose RIGHT as the next move.

Is that allowed? Since current direction is UP, we can choose RIGHT.

So, second move: RIGHT from (0,2) → new head at (1,2).

Check collision: (1,2). Current body after first move is [(0,1)] + [ (1,1), ... , (3,4) ].

Wait no—after moving UP to (0,2), the body becomes [ (0,1) ] + previous body except tail. So the new body would be [ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), ..., (3,2) ] → because we removed the last cell after inserting old head.

So (1,2) is not in the current body. Therefore, it's safe to move RIGHT.

After moving RIGHT to (1,2):

- New head: (1,2)
- Insert old head (0,2) at front of body → new body becomes [ (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), ... ] but since we didn't eat apple, remove the tail.

Wait, original body after first move was 8 segments: [ (0,1), (1,1), ..., (4,2) ]

After inserting old head (0,2), it's 9 segments. Then remove last segment → new body is 8 segments again.

So new body is [ (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), ..., (3,2) ].

Now, from (1,2), current direction is RIGHT.

Next move can't be LEFT (since current direction is RIGHT; we can't choose LEFT).

But wait: movement rules say if current direction is LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT next. But in this case, after moving RIGHT, the current direction is RIGHT, so next moves can't be LEFT.

So from (1,2), possible directions are UP or RIGHT again.

But perhaps continuing to move RIGHT might not be the best idea because we need to go up towards y=6.

Alternatively, from (1,2), move UP.

Let me try that:

Third move: UP from (1,2) → new head at (1,3).

Check collision: (1,3). Current body is [ (0,2), (0,1), ..., (3,2) ].

So (1,3) is not in the body. Safe.

Proceeding:

After third move UP to (1,3):

- Insert old head (1,2) at front of body → new body becomes [ (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), ..., (3,2) ].
- Remove tail → new body is 8 segments.

From (1,3), current direction is UP. Next move can't be DOWN.

Options: LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again.

But moving UP further would take us closer to the apple.

So fourth move: UP to (1,4).

Check collision: (1,4). Current body after third move is [ (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), ..., (3,2) ] → no (1,4) in body. Safe.

Proceeding:

After moving UP again, head at (1,4), direction remains UP.

Next moves can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.

But we need to reach x=2 and y=6.

Alternatively, perhaps move right again after a few ups.

Wait, let's see: from (1,4), if I choose RIGHT:

Fifth move: RIGHT → (2,4).

Check collision: (2,4). Current body is [ (1,3) ] + previous body except tail. Wait, no:

After fourth move UP to (1,4):

- Insert old head (1,3) at front of body.
- Then remove tail.

So the new body would be [ (1,3), (0,2), (0,1), ..., (2,2) ] → because we removed the last cell after inserting.

Thus, (2,4) is not part of the body. Safe to move.

Now at (2,4), current direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

Options: UP or RIGHT again.

But moving further right might take us away from the apple's x=2, so perhaps we should start moving up towards y=6.

Wait, but from (2,4), x=2, which is closer to the target x=2. So let's keep moving UP.

Fifth move: UP to (2,5).

Check collision: (2,5). Current body after fourth move is [ (1,3) ] + ... → no conflict. Safe.

Proceeding:

After fifth move, head at (2,5), direction UP.

Next moves can be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.

Sixth move: UP to (2,6).

Check collision: new head (2,6). Current body after fifth move is [ (2,4) ] + previous steps. Wait, no:

Wait, let's track the body carefully.

After first move: [ (0,1) ]

After second move (RIGHT): [ (1,2), (0,2) ]

After third move (UP): [ (1,3), (1,2), (0,2) ]

After fourth move (UP): [ (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (0,2) ]

Wait, no—each time we insert the old head at front and remove tail.

I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to track each step more carefully.

Step 1: Initial position. Head is at (0,1). Body is [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), ... , up to (3,4)].

But actually, initially, the snake's body starts with head followed by body segments leading to tail. So when moving, the head moves first, then each segment follows the previous one.

After step 1: Move UP from (0,1) → new head at (0,2). Body becomes [(0,2), (0,1), (1,1), ..., up to (3,4)] but since we didn't eat anything, the tail is removed. So body is now [ (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ] → 6 segments.

Wait, no—the initial snake length was probably longer, but I'm not sure of the exact setup. This approach might be too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps the best path is to move UP initially and then navigate around the body.

But given the complexity, maybe the answer is that it's possible by moving in a specific sequence without collision.
</think>

To determine if you can reach (2,6) from (0,1) without colliding with your own body, follow these steps:

1. **Move UP** to (0,2).
2. **Move RIGHT** to (1,2).
3. **Move UP** to (1,3).
4. **Move UP** to (1,4).
5. **Move RIGHT** to (2,4).
6. **Move UP** to (2,5).
7. **Move UP** to (2,6).

By following this path, you navigate around your body and reach the target without collision.

$\boxed{(2,6)}$
