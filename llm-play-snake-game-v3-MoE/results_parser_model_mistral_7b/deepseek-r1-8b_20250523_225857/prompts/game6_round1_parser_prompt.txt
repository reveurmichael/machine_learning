<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake is at (5,5) and needs to reach the apple at (5,9). The initial direction is "NONE", and the body cells are empty. I need to plan a safe path for the head to eat the apple without colliding with itself or going out of bounds.

First, I should understand the movement rules better. Since the current direction is "NONE", the first move can be any direction—UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But after that, the snake can't reverse direction. So if I go UP first, my next move can't be DOWN; it has to be either UP again or a different direction like RIGHT or LEFT.

The goal is to get from (5,5) to (5,9), which is directly above the head. The Manhattan distance between them is 4 units up. So ideally, I want to move straight up without getting into any dangerous positions.

But I need to be cautious about the snake's body segments. Each time the snake moves, it grows by one segment unless it eats the apple, in which case it doesn't drop a segment. However, after eating, the tail must still have a way to move on the next turn to avoid getting trapped.

Let me consider possible paths:

1. **Moving Up Immediately**: Starting with "UP" would take me to (5,6). That seems safe since there's no body in the way and it's within bounds. Then I can continue moving UP each time, checking if the head is at (5,9) on the next move.

2. **Checking for Collisions**: Each new position must not coincide with any of the body segments except when eating the apple. Since the body is initially empty, this isn't a concern until the snake starts growing.

3. **Avoiding Reversals**: I need to ensure that after the first move, I don't reverse directions. So if I start by moving UP, I can't switch to DOWN later on; I have to continue in the same or another non-reversing direction.

4. **Growth and Safety**: Each time I eat the apple, the snake grows, so I need to make sure that after growing, there's still a way for the tail to move without causing a collision.

Let me outline a possible sequence of moves:

- Move UP to (5,6).
- Move UP again to (5,7).
- Move UP to (5,8).
- Then, perhaps, move RIGHT or LEFT once to avoid being stuck.
- Finally, move UP to (5,9) to eat the apple.

Wait, but if I'm at (5,8), moving UP would take me directly to (5,9). That's the apple. But after eating, the tail doesn't move, so I need to ensure that in the next move, the snake can still move without colliding with its own body.

After eating, the head is at (5,9), and the body is still at (5,8) as the last segment. So on the next turn, if I try moving DOWN, it would go back to (5,8), but that's allowed because the tail is already there. However, if the body has grown beyond that point, maybe there's an issue.

Wait, no—when you eat the apple, the snake grows by one segment, so the body length increases. So after eating at (5,9), the body would be [(5,9), (5,8)]. Then, on the next move, if I try moving LEFT or RIGHT, it can do so without colliding because the tail is at (5,8). Moving UP or DOWN from (5,9) isn't possible since it's already at the top of the grid.

Hmm, maybe after eating, the snake should have another direction to go. So perhaps before reaching the apple, I should move in a different direction to create space.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT once after getting close could allow me to maneuver around if needed.

Let me think about the exact steps:

1. Move UP: (5,6)
2. Move UP: (5,7)
3. Move UP: (5,8)
4. Now, to avoid being stuck at (5,9), maybe move RIGHT to (6,8)
5. Then move UP to (6,9)
6. But that's not directly the apple... Hmm, this seems convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to go straight up and then after eating, change direction if necessary.

Wait, but the problem says I need to reach the apple at (5,9). So ideally, the last move should be UP from (5,8) to (5,9).

But when I'm at (5,8), moving UP would take me to the apple. After eating, the snake's body becomes [(5,9), (5,8)], and on the next turn, I need to make sure that there's a valid move.

From (5,9), possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT, but not DOWN since it's at y=9. So if I move RIGHT from (5,9) to (6,9), that would be allowed as long as the body isn't blocking it.

Wait, but after eating, the snake's body is [(5,9), (5,8)]. So when moving from (5,9), the next position (6,9) must not collide with any body segments except possibly the tail. The tail is at (5,8), which isn't adjacent to (6,9). So that move should be safe.

Therefore, a possible sequence is:

1. UP → (5,6)
2. UP → (5,7)
3. UP → (5,8)
4. RIGHT → (6,8)
5. UP → (6,9)
6. UP → (6,10) – Wait, that's out of bounds!

Oops, that won't work. So after step 5, I'm at (6,9), which is within the grid. From there, moving UP would take me to (6,10), which is outside the grid—causing a collision.

So that approach doesn't work because it leads out of bounds.

Maybe instead, from (5,8), move RIGHT once to (6,8), then DOWN twice to get back down and reach (5,9).

Wait, but after eating at (5,9), I can't go DOWN from there. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the snake should turn right before reaching the apple to avoid getting stuck.

Let me think: Starting at (5,5), move UP to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), then RIGHT again to (7,6), and so on, but that seems like it's going away from the target. That doesn't make sense because I need to go up to reach (5,9).

Wait, perhaps after moving UP a few times, I can move LEFT or RIGHT once to create space.

Let me try this:

1. Move UP → (5,6)
2. Move UP → (5,7)
3. Move UP → (5,8)
4. Move RIGHT → (6,8)
5. Move DOWN → (6,7)
6. Move DOWN → (6,6)
7. Move LEFT → (5,6)
8. Move UP → (5,7)
9. Move UP → (5,8)
10. Move UP → (5,9)

But this seems unnecessarily long and might cause collisions with the body segments.

Wait, each time I move, I have to check that the new head doesn't collide with any body parts except when eating the apple.

So after step 3, when I'm at (5,8), the body is [(5,6), (5,7)] if I moved UP three times. Wait no—each move adds a segment unless eating.

Wait, initial state: head at (5,5), body is empty.

Move UP to (5,6): body becomes [(5,5)], since we add the old head.

Then move UP again to (5,7): body becomes [(5,6), (5,5)].

Third move UP to (5,8): body becomes [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5)].

So when I'm at (5,8), my body is [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]. If I then move RIGHT to (6,8), that's a new position not occupied by the body. Then the body would be updated by adding the old head (5,8) and removing the tail (5,5). So new body is [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].

Then, moving DOWN to (6,7): check if it's within bounds and not colliding. The body is at (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), so (6,7) is safe. Then the body becomes [(6,8), (5,8), (5,7)].

Continuing this way seems too complicated and might lead to the snake getting stuck or reversing directions in a way that's not allowed.

Maybe a better approach is to go straight up and then, after eating, move left or right once to avoid being trapped.

So let me try:

1. Move UP → (5,6)
2. Move UP → (5,7)
3. Move UP → (5,8)
4. Now, at (5,8), check if moving UP would eat the apple. Yes, (5,9) is the apple.

So after step 4, move UP to (5,9):

- This eats the apple, so body grows by one segment.
- The new head is (5,9).
- Body becomes [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)] plus the old head (5,5). Wait no—when eating, we add the old head to the front and keep all body segments. So the new body would be [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)], but wait, that's not correct.

Wait, let me clarify:

When you eat the apple, your body grows by one segment, so you add the head position to the front of your body. So after eating at (5,9):

- The new body is [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].

But actually, no—each time you move, you add the old head to the front of the body and remove the tail unless you're eating. So after step 4: at (5,8), the body is [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5)].

Then, moving UP to (5,9) to eat:

- The new body becomes [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].

But that's four segments. Then on the next move, I need to make sure that from (5,9), I can move without colliding with my body except at the tail.

If I try moving LEFT, it would go to (4,9). Check if that's within bounds—yes.

Check if (4,9) is occupied by any part of the body except the tail. The tail is at (5,6), which is far away. So (4,9) is safe.

Therefore, a possible sequence:

1. UP → (5,6)
2. UP → (5,7)
3. UP → (5,8)
4. UP → (5,9) [Eat apple]
5. LEFT → (4,9)

This seems to work because from (5,9), moving LEFT doesn't collide with any body parts except the tail at (5,6). Since (4,9) is adjacent to nothing but empty space, this move is safe.

So the moves would be:

1. UP
2. UP
3. UP
4. UP (to eat)
5. LEFT

Thus, the sequence is: UP, UP, UP, UP, LEFT.

But wait, in step 4, moving from (5,8) to (5,9) eats the apple, so the body becomes [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].

Then step 5: move LEFT from (5,9) to (4,9). Check if this is safe.

Body is [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)]. The new head is at (4,9).

Looking at the body, the tail is at (5,6), and all other segments are along y=5, so no collision occurs. Thus, this move is valid.

Therefore, this sequence works without causing any collisions or reversals beyond the allowed first move.

So the final moves would be:

1. Move UP
2. Move UP
3. Move UP
4. Move UP (to eat)
5. Move LEFT

Thus, the snake successfully reaches the apple at (5,9) and can continue moving without getting stuck.
</think>

The optimal sequence of moves is as follows:

1. **Move UP** to (5,6).
2. **Move UP** again to (5,7).
3. Continue by **moving UP** to (5,8).
4. Finally, **move UP** one more time to reach the apple at (5,9) and eat it.
5. After eating, move **LEFT** to (4,9).

This sequence ensures that the snake reaches the apple safely without reversing directions or causing collisions.

**Answer:** The optimal moves are UP, UP, UP, UP, then LEFT. Thus, the final step is moving LEFT after reaching the apple.

$\boxed{\text{Move UP, UP, UP, UP, and then LEFT}}$

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (5, 9).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
