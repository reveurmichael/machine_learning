{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving RIGHT first allows the snake to position itself away from its body and towards a path that leads upwards towards the apple. Subsequently, moving UP and then LEFT helps navigate closer to the target without colliding with the snake's own body."
