{
"moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,0) with direction DOWN. To reach (0,9), it needs 5 LEFT and 9 UP moves. First move can't be UP (reverse of DOWN), so LEFT is chosen to reduce x. Then, moving UP aligns with the apple's y-coordinate. The body shifts upward as the snake moves, avoiding collisions. After reaching (4,9), moving LEFT navigates to (0,9) while staying clear of the body. This path ensures safe progression without reversing direction prematurely."
