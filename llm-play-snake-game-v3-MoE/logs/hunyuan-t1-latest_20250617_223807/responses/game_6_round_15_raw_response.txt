========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,6) with direction RIGHT. Moving RIGHT twice brings the head to (7,6), avoiding body collisions. From (7,6), moving DOWN reaches the apple at (7,5) safely. This path avoids self-collision and ensures the snake doesn't trap itself after eating the apple."
