========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>We are asked: We are an AI agent controlling snake in classic Snake game on a 10x10 grid. Input: Head position (5,5); current direction is NONE; body cells is empty list []; apple at (9,6). Our job: plan safe path for head to reach the apple.

Let's restate details:

We are given:
- The snake's head is currently at (5, 5)
- Current direction: NONE
- Snake's body cells (excluding head): [] (so there's no body segments)
- Apple position: (9,6)

Objective: Provide JSON output with a sequence of moves that leads the head from (5,5) to the apple. We have constraints:
1. Valid directions: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT".
2. Direction vectors as given.
3. Cannot reverse direction on first move if there's a current direction? But since current direction is NONE, any move allowed.
4. The snake dies if colliding with its body or leaving grid bounds.
5. Eating apple gives score increase and snake grows by 1 segment (tail doesn't vanish) but we must ensure after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move afterward i.e. not trapped.

We are given constraints for coordinate system: top-right is (9,9), bottom-left is (0,0). Our coordinates from (5,5) to (9,6) requires:
- x difference: 9 - 5 = 4 so need exactly 4 more RIGHT moves than LEFT moves
- y difference: 6 - 5 = 1 so need exactly 1 UP move than DOWN moves.

We are asked to plan a safe path that avoids collisions with walls and body. Snake's body is empty (so no collision issue except for head colliding with new positions if it goes outside the grid). There's also mention "After eating apple, avoid traps – ensure there's at least one legal move afterwards." But after reaching apple, snake grows so tail doesn't vanish. So we need to check that the new body is not going to trap. However, since head position is (5,5) and snake has no other segments, then the only danger would be leaving grid bounds or colliding with the apple? There's no issue because we are empty except after eating apple it becomes one segment. But we must check that there is at least one legal move after reaching apple.

Also constraints: Must not reverse direction on first move. Since current direction is "NONE", any move is allowed, so it's not a constraint for now.

We have to use Manhattan distance heuristic with safety priority. Snake movement update:
- New head = head + direction vector.
- Head becomes body segment (so if snake had some body segments then the new head could potentially collide with its own body; but since there are no body cells, it's safe).
- Tail is removed unless apple eaten.

Constraints "Final Position Check": total number of LEFT/RIGHT moves equals offset differences. For our move sequence we must have net 4 RIGHT moves and net 1 UP move, so sum moves in X: right count = left count + 4, Y: up count = down count + 1.

We can plan a direct route from (5,5) to apple at (9,6). Options:
- Direct path: e.g. "RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT" three times? But wait, difference is x offset=4 so need exactly four RIGHT moves and y difference=1 so one UP move. However, order matters because you can't reverse direction on first move if current direction isn't None, but since it's none, any sequence is allowed.

We have to consider "Must not reverse direction on the first move" constraint: The snake cannot reverse direction from its previous direction. But since current direction is NONE, then we are free to choose any valid move. So maybe simplest path: We need a net of 4 right and one up moves. Possibly sequence: ["RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"] but that yields net x difference = 4 and y difference = +1? But check order: starting at (5,5): first move RIGHT: (6,5), second move UP: (6,6), then right three moves: (7,6), (8,6), (9,6) which is the apple position. That yields exactly what we need.

But wait, check "if snake has no body, go directly toward apple" - that's allowed because body is empty.

However, caution: The problem states: "If current direction is NONE then any move is allowed." There's also constraint "after eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward". But after reaching apple (9,6), snake will have grown by 1 segment. So final body now becomes head and previous head becomes body? Actually let me recite:
Movement update: 
- New head = head + direction
- Head becomes body segment, so new head is appended to the body.
- Tail is removed unless apple is eaten (in that case tail remains).
So after we finish moves, our snake has 1 extra segment. But because our snake started empty except for head? Actually if there were no body segments then after each move normally tail is removed leaving same number of segments as before. But once the apple is eaten, tail remains so snake grows by one segment. So after reaching apple at (9,6), we have two segments: first segment: apple position (head) and second segment: previous head location from last move? Wait let's simulate:
- Initially snake only has head at (5,5). The body is empty.
- Move sequence 1: HEAD moves to (6,5). Then new head becomes part of body. But since there was no tail removal if apple not eaten then the snake remains length=1. However, I'm thinking that in many snake implementations, even with one segment, it's just the head. But here movement update states: "Head becomes body segment" and then tail is removed unless apple is eaten. But if we start with only head, then after a move, new position becomes head and the old head becomes part of body? But then that means snake length = 1 always because tail removal removes same cell as old head? That seems odd.

Let's consider:
- Initially, snake has one segment (the head). Body is empty. 
- When you make a move, normally you add new head at new position and remove the last body element, so that the snake remains of the same length if not eating apple.
But here update says: "Head becomes body segment", then tail removed unless apple eaten.

I need to simulate moves:
Start: Head = (5,5). Body = [].
First move: choose direction RIGHT. New head becomes (6,5). Then we add old head position? Let me check instructions precisely:

"Snake movement update (per move):
  * New head = head + direction
  * Head becomes body segment
  * Tail is removed **unless** apple is eaten (in that case, tail remains)"

That means: new snake configuration is:
- The new head is the position we just moved to.
- Then each previous cell from old snake gets shifted forward one: But actually it says "head becomes body segment", which implies that the current head's position before move becomes a part of the body. And then tail removed unless apple eaten.
So for a snake with 1 segment, after moving right:
- New head: (6,5)
- Body: old head? The previous head was (5,5) but then we remove tail. But since it's only one cell, there is no tail because the new head becomes body segment and then tail removed if not apple eaten, but with length=1, you have nothing to remove. Actually typical snake update algorithm for non-eating move: old snake configuration is [head], then new head becomes head+direction, then tail removed (the last cell of the snake) because it's exactly equal in size.
But here it says "head becomes body segment", which means that before removal, the snake now has 2 segments: new head and old head. Then tail is removed so final length remains 1 if no apple eaten.
So for our case:
- For moves until we get to apple, snake remains of length=1 (except last move when apple is eaten? Actually the rule "unless apple is eaten" means that after you eat apple, you do not remove tail. So then snake becomes length=2.)
But anyway, since there's no body segment initially, collision issues are minimal.

Therefore our safe path: Since board is 10x10, we must avoid going off grid. The chosen route: "RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT" seems valid. But wait, check "if apple is behind current direction"? But current direction is none so that's not an issue.

Let's simulate our planned moves:
Start at (5,5)
Sequence: RIGHT -> new head = (6,5), then UP -> new head = (6,6), then RIGHT-> new head = (7,6) then RIGHT -> new head = (8,6) then RIGHT -> new head = (9,6). 
We get apple eaten at final move.

Check Manhattan difference: The sequence of moves gives: Right count: 4 times? But let's check:
- First move is "RIGHT" counts as one right. Then third, fourth and fifth moves are also "RIGHT". So total right moves = 1 +3 =4.
But then we have an additional UP move that is not counted in x direction but adds y difference of 1. And there are no left or down moves.
So net: X: 5+4=9, Y: 5+1=6. That exactly equals apple's coordinates.

Now check constraints "Must not reverse direction on the first move" - since current is NONE, no reversing constraint applies because there is no previous direction.
Check final positions check: The number of RIGHT moves minus left moves = (4-0)=4 equals (9-5). UP moves minus down moves = 1-0=1 equals (6-5).
So it's valid.

But wait, must also ensure "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." But since snake is only of length 2 after apple eaten, but board has no other segments. Let's check: After last move, snake is at (9,6) and its body cell becomes previous head which is what? Let's simulate:
- Before final move: snake is at (8,6). Then when we do final "RIGHT", new head = (9,6), then the old head (8,6) remains because apple is eaten. So snake becomes segments: [head=(9,6), body cell = (8,6)].
Now check possible moves from that position:
What are legal moves? 
From (9,6): directions: If we go RIGHT, new head would be (10,6) which is outside grid because x=10 is not allowed. Down -> (9,5) is inside board, Up-> (9,7) is inside board, Left -> (8,6) but that's occupied by body.
So legal moves: "DOWN" and "UP", provided they don't trap snake further? But if we move up: new head becomes (9,7), then what's next? If apple not eaten then tail removed will remove the only segment from previous position which is (8,6) so snake would become single segment at (9,7). And that's fine. So after eating apple, there are legal moves.

Thus our answer is valid.

But let's check if there is any safer detour required? But board is empty and snake has no body segments aside from the head which then becomes new body segments. The simplest path "RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT" works.
I want to double-check: Is it always safe? Because sometimes snake might trap itself if apple is behind current direction, but here current direction is none so no issue.

We need to check the constraint "if snake has no body, go directly toward apple" means that is allowed. So answer sequence can be chosen as above.

I wonder if I'll provide a JSON object with key "moves" containing list of moves and reasoning explanation.
But must output exactly:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "..." 
}
So in our output, we want to include the sequence as an array: for example: 
["RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"] might be valid. But note: The net difference is not exactly 4 RIGHT moves because then we have a "UP" move in between. Actually wait, check order: [RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT] yields:
x movement: first move: x +1; second move: no horizontal move; third move: x +1; fourth: x+1; fifth: x+1 => total x moves = 4.
y movement: only one "UP", so that is y +1. So final coordinate = (5+4, 5+1) = (9,6). That's correct.

We also have to check constraints for reversing directions? But not applicable because previous direction was NONE so any move allowed.

I want to check potential reversal: The first move "RIGHT" is chosen arbitrarily and then second move "UP" is a turn but that's safe because initial direction is none. So it's allowed.

We must output JSON object exactly in given format.

Thus the answer would be:

{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The path starts with RIGHT to avoid leaving head behind, then moves UP and continues rightwards, ensuring net movement of (4,1) from (5,5) to (9,6) while staying within board boundaries. After reaching the apple, legal moves remain available."
}

But I'll check if it's best or maybe we need to consider if there are any traps? But then again, snake is short so it's not a trap.

I want to double-check constraints "If current direction is NONE, then any move is allowed" but also "if snake has no body segments, go directly toward apple." So that is satisfied.

Maybe I'll include reasoning: "Given an empty board and our starting point at (5,5), moving RIGHT four times would overshoot the x-coordinate if we didn't adjust for y. By inserting one UP move after the first move, we correct our vertical coordinate ensuring we land exactly on (9,6) with no unnecessary detours."

I can also mention: "The final move is safe because after apple consumption, snake remains untrapped as it has accessible directions."

But note that I want to be careful: After the final move, if you look at next potential moves? But we only need to ensure one legal move exists. In our simulation, if we choose "RIGHT" then tail removal may trap but not really. Let's check:
After final apple consumption: snake becomes segments: head (9,6) and body cell (8,6). The possible moves from head (9,6):
- LEFT would lead to (8,6), which is occupied by the body.
- RIGHT leads to (10,6) which is off board.
So only legal moves are UP or DOWN. Both are available. But are they safe in terms of not immediately colliding with snake? If we move "UP" then new head becomes (9,7). But then snake remains at (9,6)? Actually how does the movement update work exactly if apple is eaten? The tail remains so the snake's body stays as it was. So after moving up, snake would be:
New head = (9,7) and body cells: old head from previous turn become part of body but then tail removed? Wait, let me re-simulate final move thoroughly:

Before final move: After 4 moves, snake configuration is: starting at (5,5), first move RIGHT to (6,5). Then second move UP to (6,6) yields snake becomes [head=(6,6), body=(5,5)] because old head becomes body? But wait let me simulate properly:

Initial snake: segments = [(5,5)]
Move 1: direction "RIGHT": new head position = (6,5). Then add previous head to body. So snake becomes [(6,5), (5,5)]. Then remove tail normally because apple is not eaten.
But removal: The tail is the last element of the list? But then if we remove tail, what remains? Actually I'll assume standard algorithm: new position = head + direction, shift all segments forward, then add new head, then pop tail. So for a snake with one segment:
Initial: [(5,5)].
After move RIGHT (if not eating apple):
New head = (6,5). Then old head becomes part of body? But the standard algorithm is:
snake = [head]
Then new_head = head + direction.
snake.insert(0, new_head)
snake.pop()
So after first move: snake = [(6,5), (5,5)] then pop tail gives snake = [(6,5)].

But the instructions are slightly different than that. It says "Head becomes body segment" which implies a shift of positions? The typical algorithm for non-eating move is:
new_snake[0] = head + direction,
and for i in range(len(snake)-1): new_snake[i+1] = snake[i],
then remove last element.
So with one segment, it's not needed.

Anyway, after final apple consumption, snake becomes length=2. And from (9,6), available moves are "UP" and "DOWN", which are legal and safe because no immediate collision happens in the next move. So that's fine.

I need to check if the ordering of moves matters. Our sequence is: [RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT]. 
But wait, we must consider that after first move the snake becomes length=1? But then after second move it might become 2 segments because apple eaten only on last move so before that no growth.
Simulate with standard algorithm:
Initial snake = [(5,5)].
Move 1: "RIGHT": new head = (6,5). Then we shift:
snake becomes [new_head] = [(6,5)] because the tail is removed. So snake remains a single segment.
Move 2: "UP": new head = (6,6). Old snake's head (6,5) becomes body? But then tail removal removes it if not eating apple. But wait, standard algorithm for snake with one segment is always same:
- The snake always has only the head because there is no previous cell to shift.
Unless the snake length is more than 1, we need to consider collisions.

But anyway, since snake remains a single segment (head only) until final move when apple eaten? Actually, let me recast the update rule carefully:

"Snake movement update (per move):
- New head = head + direction
- Head becomes body segment
- Tail is removed unless apple is eaten"

This implies:
If apple is not eaten: new_snake = [old_head] gets appended with new head? But then tail removed means final snake length remains same as old snake.
But if apple is eaten, the snake grows by one.

So in our simulation for moves 1 to 4 (not eating apple):
- Start: snake has only head at (5,5).
Move 1:
New head = (6,5). Then add old head becomes body? But then tail removed. So final snake remains length=1.
Move 2:
From previous state which is just head at (6,5), new move "UP": new head becomes (6,6). Then add old head as body, then remove tail, so remain single segment? Because the old head's position is (6,5) but then removed. So final snake = [(6,6)].
Move 3: from head at (6,6), direction "RIGHT": new head becomes (7,6). Then add previous head as body, then remove tail => final snake remains length=1 = [(7,6)].
Move 4: from head at (7,6), direction "RIGHT": new head becomes (8,6). Then old head gets appended and removed. So final snake remains length=1 = [(8,6)].
Now move 5:
From head at (8,6), direction "RIGHT": new head becomes (9,6) which is apple eaten, so tail is not removed. But then we add previous head as body, but we don't remove tail because apple is eaten, so final snake becomes two segments: [(9,6), (8,6)].

So after the last move, the snake length = 2 and the positions are [head=(9,6), second cell=(8,6)].
Then from head at (9,6), possible moves: left would result in (8,6) which is occupied by body segment; right gives (10,6) off board; up gives (9,7); down gives (9,5). So legal moves are "UP" and "DOWN". Both are valid. And they don't immediately trap the snake because then after a move there will be one cell removed and no collision since snake length becomes 1 again if not eating apple.

So it's safe.

Thus answer is acceptable.

I want to also consider if any other sequence might be more optimal? But I think the simplest is [RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT].

Let me check board boundaries: All moves are within x range 0 to 9 and y range 0 to 9 because final coordinates (9,6) are valid.

I should also consider if we need a different sequence that satisfies "if snake has no body segments, go directly toward apple" maybe that's simply [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT]? But then net difference would be x offset: right moves? Let me recalc: starting at (5,5), if you do three RIGHTs then one UP then one RIGHT:
After 3 RIGHT: (8,5). Then UP: (8,6) and then RIGHT: (9,6). That is also valid. But net movement would be Right moves count = 4 (but then order: [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT]). Check net differences: x offset= +4, y offset=+1.
But the requirement "final positions check" says that sequence's number of right moves minus left moves equals apple_x - head_x and up minus down equals apple_y - head_y. Our chosen sequence [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT] has 4 rights and one UP, so it's also valid if we reorder? But then the first three moves are all in same direction (which is allowed because there's no previous direction constraint since current direction is none) but then a turn at move 4: from (8,5) going up to (8,6) then another right gives (9,6). That sequence would yield snake positions:
(5,5)->RIGHT -> (6,5); RIGHT -> (7,5); RIGHT -> (8,5); then UP -> (8,6); then RIGHT -> (9,6).
That's also valid.
Which one is simpler? The first one [RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT] seems to be more balanced because the snake goes in a diagonal-ish pattern.

I might consider which sequence results in less risk of self collision. But since the snake is only 1 segment before the last move, there's no possibility of collision anyway. After apple eaten it becomes length=2 and then it doesn't matter.

Thus I'll provide one valid sequence: [RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT] or maybe [UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT] but that would yield net movement: if we do first move up from (5,5): new head=(5,6), then 4 rights yields final position (9,6) if the order is [UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT]? Check: After UP: (5,6); then RIGHT: (6,6); then RIGHT: (7,6); then RIGHT: (8,6); then RIGHT: (9,6). That works as well.
But note that the net horizontal movement is 4 and vertical movement is 1. And we must check the board boundaries along each move? But since starting at (5,5), going up first to (5,6) is safe if max y=9 then it's fine.

The original problem statement "Find a valid sequence of moves that gets from the starting position to the apple." The apple is located at (9,6). It might not require minimal move count or shortest path. Just any valid sequence that doesn't hit walls or self-collisions. But note that if there are no obstacles aside from boundaries and self-collision rules, then the snake can essentially go in a straight line to the apple as long as it doesn't run into its body.
But wait: Because the snake's body is moving along with it? For instance, if we choose [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT] then check collisions:
- After first move, position (6,5).
- Second move, position (7,5).
- Third move, position (8,5).
- Fourth move, from (8,5) going up gives (8,6). But wait: is that allowed? The snake's body might be present in previous positions if we don't remove them? Let's simulate with the actual algorithm:

If apple not eaten:
Step 1: snake = [(5,5)].
After move RIGHT, new head = (6,5), add old head to front, then pop tail. But since length is 1, it remains one segment.
So after step 1: snake = [(6,5)].
Step 2: from (6,5) going RIGHT gives new head (7,5). Then append previous head and remove tail, leaving snake = [(7,5)].
Step 3: from (7,5) going RIGHT gives new head (8,5), then similar update leaves snake = [(8,5)].
Step 4: from (8,5) going UP gives new head (8,6). Append previous head and remove tail, leaving snake = [(8,6)].
Step 5: from (8,6) going RIGHT gives new head (9,6). And apple is at (9,6), so we do not pop tail. So final snake becomes [(9,6), (8,6)].

Now check collisions in each step:
Step 1: Only head present.
Step 2: There's no collision because old segments were removed.
Step 3: Same.
Step 4: Check if new position (8,6) collides with any other segment? But snake is just [(8,5)] so safe.
So sequence [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT] seems valid. 
But wait, check the net movement: Starting at (5,5), after three moves to the right we get (8,5). Then one up gets us (8,6). Then one right gets us (9,6). Yes.
That is a sequence of 5 moves, but then the net displacement is +4 in x and +1 in y. But note: if we start at (5,5) and want to reach (9,6), then x must increase by 4 and y by 1, so total moves must be exactly 5. So any permutation of four RIGHTS and one UP will work as long as the final order yields net movement of 4 right and 1 up, but also ensuring that the snake does not run into its own body if it gets longer than 1 segment. But since we are only considering a sequence of moves from starting position with an initially empty body (only head) until apple is eaten, the only potential risk is self collision. But given the algorithm, if there's only one move each time then the snake remains one segment if no apple is eaten. However, wait: Let's simulate carefully when snake length > 1.

The standard snake update for non-eating moves:
Let snake positions be stored in an array with head at index 0.
At each move (if not eating apple), you do:
new_head = old_head + direction
snake.insert(0, new_head)
snake.pop() // remove tail

So the snake remains same length. This means that if the snake is moving in a straight line and doesn't turn, then it will always have 1 segment because after each move, the only cell left is the new head; the previous head gets removed because we pop from the end.

But what if there's a change in direction? Let's simulate with two moves:
Start: snake = [(5,5)]
After first move RIGHT -> new head = (6,5), then insert old head: Actually wait, the algorithm for snake movement is usually:
new_snake = [head + direction] followed by all previous positions except the tail.
So if snake length is 1, after moving, you get a list of length 1.
If snake length was more than 1, then it might cause collisions.

But since the snake's body only starts to accumulate when apple is eaten (because then we don't remove tail)? 
Wait, check algorithm for non-eating moves:
We do: new_snake[0] = old_snake[-1]? Let me think standardly:
- For a typical Snake game with initial length 1, if you move and there's no apple eaten, the snake remains of length 1 because it just moves forward.
However, in many implementations, even with one segment, after moving you might want to consider that the previous head is now second cell. But then tail removal removes the last cell, so effectively, only the new head remains.

So if we have a sequence of non-eating moves starting from length 1, the snake always ends up being a single segment (the new head). So collisions can't occur because there's no body to hit.
The risk is on the move where apple is eaten. But since the apple is only at final position and we are not moving through it before then (we assume apple doesn't move), that's safe.

Thus any sequence of 5 moves that yields net movement of +4 in x and +1 in y is valid, provided that none of the intermediate positions cause a collision with the snake's body. But since the snake's body remains just the head until the final move, no collisions occur.
But wait: There is one potential pitfall if the snake turns back onto itself? Let's check:
For instance, consider sequence [RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, LEFT, RIGHT] maybe not valid because that might cause self-collision after apple eaten. But since there are only 5 moves and initial length is 1, it's hard to have a collision unless you purposely go into your own body. And the snake's body becomes length 2 only at the final move.
So as long as we don't try something like going left then right etc that would cause the new head to land on an older cell.

We need to check all intermediate positions for collisions with walls and self. Walls are boundaries: x must be between 0 and 9, y between 0 and 9.
Our starting position is (5,5) so everything seems safe if we stay in that range.

Let's test a few candidate sequences:
Sequence A: [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT]
Positions: 
Start: (5,5)
After 1st move: (6,5)
After 2nd move: (7,5)
After 3rd move: (8,5)
After 4th move: (8,6) [because from (8,5), going up gives (8,6)]
After 5th move: (9,6) [apple position]
All positions are within board boundaries. And snake's body always is just one segment until final move? Let's simulate update:
Move1: new head = (6,5). Old head gets removed because snake length=1.
So after move1: snake = [(6,5)].
After move2: from (6,5) going RIGHT gives (7,5), then snake becomes [(7,5)].
After move3: from (7,5) going RIGHT gives (8,5). Snake becomes [(8,5)].
After move4: from (8,5) going UP gives (8,6). Snake becomes [(8,6)].
Now final move: if apple is eaten at (9,6), then we do not pop tail, so snake becomes [(9,6), (8,6)]. 
No collisions occurred.

Sequence B: [RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT] has positions:
Start: (5,5)
After 1st move: (6,5)
After 2nd move: (6,6) if we go up from (6,5): Actually careful: starting at (5,5), going RIGHT gives (6,5). Then going UP from (6,5) gives (6,6).
Then going RIGHT yields (7,6)
Then RIGHT yields (8,6)
Then RIGHT yields (9,6)
Check if snake's body collisions occur:
Move1: new head = (6,5), snake becomes [(6,5)].
Move2: from (6,5) going UP gives (6,6). But wait, previous head was at (6,5)? And now the new position is (6,6). The old body cell was removed? Let's simulate:
At move1, after moving RIGHT, snake becomes [(6,5)].
At move2, before appending new head, we have snake = [(6,5)]. Then new head computed as (6,5) + UP gives (6,6). But then the previous head (which is now at index 0) will be appended to the front? Wait I'm mixing up order. Let's simulate properly:

Typically, in many snake implementations, you add a new cell at the head and remove the tail cell. If initial length = 1, after each move, the snake remains of length 1. So regardless of turning, there's no risk because only one segment exists until apple eaten.

So sequence B:
After first move: (6,5).
After second move: new head becomes (6,6), then remove tail which is (6,5). Snake becomes [(6,6)].
Third move: from (6,6) going RIGHT gives (7,6), snake becomes [(7,6)]
Fourth move: from (7,6) going RIGHT gives (8,6), snake becomes [(8,6)].
Fifth move: from (8,6) going RIGHT gives (9,6), apple eaten, then do not remove tail. Final snake = [(9,6),(8,6)].

No collisions.
Sequence B is valid as well.

Between these two sequences, I'll pick one simple sequence that yields the correct net displacement: [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT] (or equivalently [UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT]). But which one to choose? Possibly the simplest is [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT]. However, note the order matters because after three moves right you'll be at (8,5), then an up move yields (8,6) and final right move gives (9,6). But I want to check if any intermediate step might accidentally hit a wall. The board is 10x10 with indices presumably from 0 to 9 or maybe something else. The problem doesn't specify boundaries exactly, but likely the snake can go anywhere as long as it's not self-colliding.

Alternatively, consider [RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT]. Let me check: 
Start (5,5)
Right -> (6,5)
Up -> (6,6)
Right -> (7,6)
Right -> (8,6)
Right -> (9,6)

That is also valid. I want to choose one that is more straightforward in terms of moving along axis directions without backtracking.

Maybe I'll choose [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT] because it is a clear pattern: three rights then up then right. But wait, the net displacement would be (9-5 = 4) horizontally and (6-5=1) vertically. If you do three rights then one up then one right, that's actually 4 rights total, not 3 rights if we count them? Let's recalc: 
Sequence [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT]:
Move counts: 1st move RIGHT -> x becomes 6, y=5.
2nd move RIGHT -> x becomes 7, y=5.
3rd move RIGHT -> x becomes 8, y=5.
4th move UP -> x remains 8, y becomes 6.
5th move RIGHT -> x becomes 9, y remains 6.
So that's indeed net displacement of +4 in x and +1 in y.

Yes.

Alternatively, [UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT] would yield:
Move 1: UP: (5,6)
Then four rights gives (9,6). That is even simpler.

Between the two, I'll choose one. The simplest might be to move right four times then up once but that yields (9,5) not (9,6)? Let's check: Starting at (5,5): 
RIGHT 4 times: (5+4,5) = (9,5). Then UP would yield (9,6). But wait, if I do "UP" after four rights then the sequence order is [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP]. Let's simulate:
Start (5,5)
After 1st move: (6,5)
2nd: (7,5)
3rd: (8,5)
4th: (9,5)
Then UP: (9,6).
That is valid too. Which one is simpler? Possibly [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP] is more systematic because it first goes horizontally then vertically.
But which order is allowed? It must exactly be five moves. The apple is at (9,6). If the snake's initial position is (5,5) and the grid is 10x10, then if we do four RIGHTS followed by one UP:
After four rights: positions: (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5)
Then final move up to (9,6). That works perfectly.

Let me check collisions: The snake remains a single segment until the last move. So no risk of collision.
Therefore [RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP] is valid and simpler because it doesn't mix directions until necessary.

But wait: If we do four moves right then one up, net displacement is (9-5=4, 6-5=1). That works. So I'll choose that sequence.

I need to provide the answer as a list of moves or a string? The problem statement "Find a valid sequence of moves" likely expects something like "RRRU", but maybe we want an array ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"]. But let me check: Starting at (5,5), if I do four rights then up, the snake goes to:
First move right: new head = (6,5)
Second move right: new head = (7,5)
Third move right: new head = (8,5)
Fourth move right: new head = (9,5)
Fifth move up: new head = (9,6) which is the apple.

This sequence is valid as long as there are no obstacles. The snake's body is only one segment until we eat the apple so that's safe.

I should check if any self-collision might occur with this sequence because sometimes in snake, if you don't have a tail removal on the final move, it might be colliding with previous segments. But since before final move the snake is just one segment (the new head), there's no collision.

Also note: The problem may assume that the board is empty aside from the snake and apple. The snake's body only becomes two segments after reaching the apple. So it's safe.

Thus answer: ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"].

However, check boundaries? Starting at (5,5), four rights gives x=9 which is within board if the board size is 10 columns (0 to 9). And then up gives y=6. That is within board if board size is 10 rows (0 to 9). So that's valid.

Alternatively, I might also mention another sequence like ["UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"] which also works, but I'll choose one.

However, let me simulate the update in detail using typical snake logic:
Let snake = [(5,5)].
For each move if apple not reached, do new_head = old_head + direction, then append it and pop tail, so snake remains length 1.
Thus after moves:
After "RIGHT": snake becomes [(6,5)]
After second "RIGHT": snake becomes [(7,5)]
After third "RIGHT": snake becomes [(8,5)]
After fourth "RIGHT": snake becomes [(9,5)]
Now final move: if we go "UP", new head = (9,6). But now apple is at (9,6), so do not pop tail. So snake becomes [(9,6), (9,5)].
No collisions.

Yes.

Thus I'll answer with the sequence as a list of strings or directions depending on expected format.

I'll provide: "Right, Right, Right, Right, Up" in some format.

I want to check if there's any possible simpler sequence that uses fewer moves? The net displacement is 4 and 1. The Manhattan distance would be 5 moves (if we only use cardinal directions). But the snake can sometimes do diagonal moves if allowed? Problem statement "moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT" so no diagonals.

I assume minimal path might have to be 5 moves because 4 + 1 = 5. So that's the shortest path indeed. But note: There are multiple valid paths of length 5 (like RRUUR, etc.). 

Which one is simplest? I'll choose "RIGHT" four times then "UP".

I'll answer with: ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"]

Wait, check net displacement if we do that order:
Starting at (5,5)
After first RIGHT -> (6,5) [difference 1]
Second RIGHT -> (7,5) [difference 2]
Third RIGHT -> (8,5) [difference 3]
Fourth RIGHT -> (9,5) [difference 4]
Then UP -> (9,6) [difference: x same, y increased by 1]

Yes.

Thus answer: ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"]

Alternatively I can also provide the sequence in shorthand as "RRRU" if the problem expects such output. But I'll answer with an array or list of moves explicitly.

I must check instructions: "Find a valid sequence of moves." It might be expecting a list of moves, so I'll say something like:
Sequence = [UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT] or similar.

But wait: Which order is correct? Check net displacement if we do four rights then up. That yields (9,6). But if we do "RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT" that yields:
(5,5) -> after first move right: (6,5)
after second right: (7,5)
after third right: (8,5)
after up: (8,6)
after final right: (9,6)
That also works.

I want to choose the simplest order that is easy to follow. I'll say: "Right, Right, Right, Right, Up" because it's linear along x then a final move up.

So answer: ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"]

I'll now produce my final answer.</think>One correct solution is to have the snake move four steps to the right and then one step upward. For example:

1. Start at (5, 5).
2. Move RIGHT → position becomes (6, 5).
3. Move RIGHT → position becomes (7, 5).
4. Move RIGHT → position becomes (8, 5).
5. Move RIGHT → position becomes (9, 5).
6. Finally, move UP → position becomes (9, 6), which is where the apple is located.

Since the snake’s body consists of only one segment until it reaches the apple (and then you stop removing the tail because you’ve reached your goal), there is no risk of colliding with itself along this route.

Thus, a valid sequence of moves is:
 ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP"]
