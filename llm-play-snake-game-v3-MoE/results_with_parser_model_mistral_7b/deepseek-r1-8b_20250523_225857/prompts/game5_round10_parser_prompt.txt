You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get this snake from (7,0) to eat the apple at (8,3). The snake is currently moving right because its direction is "RIGHT". So initially, it's at (7,0), and the body is just [(6,0)].

First, I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause a collision. So, when the head moves, I have to check if the new position is within the grid and not overlapping with any body segments except possibly the tail.

Looking at the apple's position at (8,3), it's three units up from the head's starting point. Since the snake can move right or up, but not reverse directions immediately unless it's the first move.

Wait, since the current direction is "RIGHT", the next move cannot be "LEFT" because that would reverse. So the possible directions are either "UP" or "RIGHT". 

If I keep moving right, the head will go to (8,0). From there, moving up might take it to (8,1), then (8,2), and finally (8,3) where the apple is. But I need to check if that path is clear.

However, the body of the snake is [(6,0)], so each move adds a new segment in front. So after moving right, the head is at (8,0), and the body becomes [(7,0), (6,0)]. Next move up to (8,1): check if that's clear.

Continuing this way, each step needs to be checked for collisions with the current body and also ensuring that after eating the apple, there's a path left.

But wait, when the head moves to (8,3), it eats the apple. Then the snake grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't move. So I need to make sure that after this, the snake can still move without getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first could be better. From (7,0), if I move up twice, the head would reach (7,2). But then moving right three times would take it from (7,2) to (8,2) and so on. However, that might require more moves and could potentially run into body segments.

I think staying on the same column is safer because moving right keeps the snake expanding along the x-axis, which is closer to the apple's x-coordinate of 8.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Move right from (7,0) to (8,0).
2. Check if that position is clear. Since the body is at (6,0), it should be fine.
3. Then move up: from (8,0) to (8,1).
4. Continue moving up to (8,2).
5. Finally, move right again? No, because we need to reach (8,3). So perhaps another up move?

Wait, the head needs to go from y=0 to y=3, so three up moves are needed.

But after each move, the snake's body grows by one segment unless it eats the apple.

Alternatively, if at any point the head reaches the apple's position, the snake will grow without moving the tail. So perhaps a more efficient path would involve taking a different direction to reach the apple with fewer moves while avoiding collisions.

But considering the initial direction is "RIGHT", the first move must be either "UP" or "RIGHT". Choosing "UP" might require the snake to turn, which could cause issues if it's not possible without reversing.

So maybe the best path is:

- Move right twice: (7,0) → (8,0) → (9,0). But wait, moving right again would go beyond the grid, so that's not allowed. So only one right move to (8,0).

Then, from there, move up three times to reach (8,3):

- Move up: (8,1)
- Move up: (8,2)
- Move up: (8,3)

Each time, check if the new head position is clear. Since initially, the body is at (6,0), and each move adds a segment in front, by the third step, the body will be [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0)], so when moving to (8,1), it's still safe.

After reaching (8,3) and eating the apple, the snake's length increases by one. So the next move needs to ensure that there's a path left, but since the head is at (8,3), moving down or left could be possible depending on body positions.

Alternatively, maybe it's safer to make sure that after each move, the snake doesn't block itself.

I think this plan should work: move right once, then up three times. Each step needs to be checked for collisions and ensuring the snake can continue moving.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 0) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 0)], to eat the apple at (8, 3).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
