<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake is at (6,8) with a head and has a body that includes (6,7). The apple is at (1,8), which is straight left from the head. My goal is to figure out a safe path for the snake's head to reach the apple without colliding into walls or its own body.

First, let me visualize this. The snake's current position is such that the head is at (6,8) and it goes down to (6,7). So right now, moving up would make sense because the apple is directly above in terms of y-coordinate but far behind in x. Wait, no, actually looking back, (1,8) has the same y as the head's current position but a lower x value by 5 units.

Since the snake can't reverse direction on its first move, I need to choose directions that will allow it to reach the apple without getting stuck later. Also, each move needs to ensure that when the new head is placed, there's still space for the body to shift without colliding into itself or the walls.

So starting from (6,8), possible initial moves could be UP since we're already at y=8 and moving up would take us closer to (1,8). But wait, moving RIGHT might also be an option if I can create a path that doesn't block later. Hmm, but let me think about the first move.

If I choose LEFT from (6,8), it goes to (5,8). Is this safe? Let's see: The snake is at (6,8) and (6,7). Moving left would make the head (5,8). The body after movement would be [(5,8), (6,8)] but wait, no. Wait, the initial body list is [(6,7)], so when moving LEFT, the new head becomes (5,8). Then, the body shifts: the old head (6,8) is added to the front of the body, and since we're not eating an apple, the tail (6,7) is removed. So the new snake would be [(5,8), (6,8)].

But wait, does this cause any collision? The previous positions are (6,8) as head and (6,7) as body. After moving LEFT, the new head is at (5,8). The rest of the body moves forward from (6,8) to become (5,8), but since we're not eating an apple, the tail at (6,7) is removed. So the new snake would be [(5,8), (6,8)]. But that's only two segments, which was already the case before? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The initial body list has one segment: (6,7). When moving LEFT from (6,8) to (5,8), we insert (6,8) at the front of the body list, making it [(6,8), (6,7)], then since not eating an apple, remove the tail. So the new snake becomes [(5,8)].

Wait no: When moving LEFT:

1. New head is (5,8).
2. The body list before update was [(6,7)]. We insert old head (6,8) at front → new body list is [(6,8), (6,7)].
3. Since not eating an apple, remove the tail: [ (6,8) ].

So after moving LEFT once, the snake's head is at (5,8). But now it only has one segment? Or maybe I'm misapplying the rules.

Wait no, when you have a body list of [(6,7)], inserting old head makes it [(6,8), (6,7)]. Then since not eating an apple, we remove the last element, which is (6,7). So now the new snake's body becomes just [(6,8)].

But wait, that doesn't make sense because moving LEFT should allow us to have a longer body? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the process. Let me check:

The initial state: S = [head (6,8), body1 (6,7)]. So length is 2.

Moving LEFT:
- New head is (5,8).
- Insert old head (6,8) at front of body → new body list is [(6,8), (6,7)].
- Since not eating an apple, remove last element: body becomes [ (6,8) ].
So S becomes [ (5,8), (6,8) ]. Wait no, because the new head is added first. So actually, after moving LEFT and before removing tail:

Body list was [(6,7)] → insert old head (6,8) at front: [(6,8), (6,7)]. Then since not eating an apple, remove last element: [ (6,8) ]. But then the new snake is HEAD = (5,8) and body is [(6,8)], which would connect HEAD to body as (5,8) → (6,8). That's a valid movement because their difference is 1 in x.

Wait, but when you have two segments, it was [(6,8), (6,7)]. After moving LEFT:

- New head: (5,8).
- Body becomes [ (6,8) ].
So S is now [(5,8), (6,8)]? Wait no. Because after inserting old head at front of body list and removing tail, the new body is [ (6,8) ]. So the snake's segments are [ (new_head=5,8 ), (6,8 ) ].

Wait that doesn't make sense because in a snake with two segments, you can't have only one segment unless it's moving into an empty space. Maybe I'm getting confused about how the body is updated.

Alternatively, perhaps when not eating apple:

1. Insert old head at front of body list.
2. Remove last element (tail) → new body is now [old_head] followed by all except tail.

So initial body was [(6,7)]:
- After inserting (6,8) → [(6,8), (6,7)]
- Then remove (6,7) → the new body is [ (6,8) ]
So S becomes [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ].

Wait that's two segments now: head at (5,8), followed by a segment at (6,8). That makes sense. So each move adds one to the front and potentially removes one from the end, keeping the length same as before except when eating apple.

But in this case, since we didn't eat an apple, the length remains 2? Or does it?

Wait no: When you have a body list of [(6,7)], which has two segments (head plus body1), moving without eating apple would result in:

- Insert head at front → [ (6,8 ), (6,7) ]
- Remove last element → [ (6,8 ) ]

So the snake's new position is:
- Head: (5,8)
- Body list becomes [(6,8)]

Wait that leaves only one segment after moving? But if you have a head and a body1 at (6,8), how does that work with movement?

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to check the rules again.

Rule 3:
a. Insert old head position at front of the BODY list.
b. If new_head == apple → grow: do not remove tail
c. Else → move normally: body becomes all but last element

So for our initial state, with body as [(6,7)]:

Moving LEFT (new_head is (5,8)):
- Insert old head (6,8) at front of body list: new_body = [ (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail → new_body becomes [ (6,8 ) ]

So the new snake S is:
[ HEAD= (5,8 ), BODY1=(6,8 ) ]

Wait that's a problem because now the body segments are [(6,8)], which would mean from (5,8) to (6,8), but then how does it connect? Because after moving LEFT once, you have two segments: head at (5,8) and body1 at (6,8). So that's a valid snake.

But wait, when the snake moves, each move shifts all the body parts forward. So in this case:

Original S is [ (6,8), (6,7 ) ]

After moving LEFT:
- New head is (5,8)
- The old head (6,8) becomes BODY1
- Body list was [(6,7)], inserting (6,8) makes it [(6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]
- Then remove last element: [ (6,8 ) ]

So the new S is:
[ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ]

Which means from (5,8) to (6,8), which is valid.

Okay, so moving LEFT once seems safe. Now, from here, what's next? The apple is at (1,8). So we need to move towards the left again.

From (5,8), moving LEFT would take us to (4,8). Let me check for collisions:

- New head: (4,8)
- Insert old head (5,8) → new_body = [ (5,8 ), ... body list becomes [(6,8)] after first move?
Wait no. After the first move, S is [ (5,8), (6,8 ) ]

So when moving from (5,8):

Inserting it at front of body list: which was [(6,8 )] → new_body = [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ]
Then since not eating an apple, remove last element → [ (5,8 ) ]

Wait no. Wait original S is after first move:

S becomes [ (5,8), (6,8) ] because you inserted the old head at front and then removed the tail.

So in this state, moving LEFT again would involve inserting new_head=(4,8) into front of body list [(6,8)] → new_body = [ (4,8 ), (6,8 ) ]

Wait no: Wait when moving from (5,8), the current S is:

[ HEAD= (5,8 ), BODY1= (6,8 ) ]

So to move LEFT again:

- Insert old head at front of body list → new_body = [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element: [ (5,8 ) ]

Wait so after moving LEFT from (5,8), the S becomes:

[ HEAD= (4,8 ), BODY1= (5,8 ) ]

So body is [(5,8)].

But wait, that seems like it's reducing the length of the snake each time you move. But according to rule 3c: if not eating apple, remove last element after inserting old head at front. So in this case:

- Initial S: [ (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]
After moving LEFT:
S becomes [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ]

Then from there, moving LEFT again would result in S becoming [ (4,8 ), (5,8 ) ]

Wait that's correct. So each move is adding one segment and then cutting off the last if not eating apple.

So continuing this way, we can keep moving LEFT:

Each time, head moves left by 1, body follows behind.

But wait, our target is at x=1, y=8. Starting from (6,8), moving left five times would take us to x=1.

So if I move LEFT each step without any other direction changes, will that work?

Let me check each step:

Step 0: head=(6,8)
Step 1: LEFT → (5,8 )
Step 2: LEFT → (4,8 )
Step 3: LEFT → (3,8 )
Step 4: LEFT → (2,8 )
Step 5: LEFT → (1,8 )

But wait, can the snake move all the way to x=0? Wait no, because when moving into position x=1 from left is possible.

Wait but each step involves adding a new head and then cutting off the last body. So if I keep moving LEFT five times, will that get us to (1,8 )?

Let me simulate:

Step 0: S = [ (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]

Move LEFT once:
New head=5,8
Insert old head at front → new_body becomes [ (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]
Then remove last element: body is [ (6,8 ) ]
So S now: [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ]

Move LEFT again:
New head=4,8
Insert old head at front of current body list → new_body = [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ]
Remove last element → [ (5,8 ) ]
S becomes: [ (4,8 ), (5,8 ) ]

Third move LEFT:
New head=3,8
Insert old head 4,8 at front of body list [ (5,8 ) ] → new_body = [ (4,8 ), (5,8 ) ]
Remove last element → [ (4,8 ) ]
S becomes: [ (3,8 ), (4,8 ) ]

Fourth move LEFT:
New head=2,8
Insert old head 3,8 at front of body list [ (4,8 ) ] → new_body = [ (3,8 ), (4,8 ) ]
Remove last element → [ (3,8 ) ]
S becomes: [ (2,8 ), (3,8 ) ]

Fifth move LEFT:
New head=1,8
Insert old head 2,8 at front of body list [ (3,8 ) ] → new_body = [ (2,8 ), (3,8 ) ]
Remove last element → [ (2,8 ) ]
S becomes: [ (1,8 ), (2,8 ) ]

So after five LEFT moves, the snake's head is at (1,8), which is where we want it. But wait, does this cause any issues with collisions or walls?

Wait when moving from step 0 to step 5:

At each move:
- The new head moves left.
- After inserting old head and removing tail, the body shifts.

But do these steps involve going into positions that might collide? For example, at some point in between, could the snake's body intersect itself?

Let me check the intermediate steps for any possible collision or wall hits.

From (6,8) moving LEFT five times. Each step:

Move 1: head is (5,8). Body becomes [(6,8)]. So from (5,8) to (6,8), which is fine as x increases by 1.
Move 2: head=(4,8). Body=[(5,8)]. From (4,8) → (5,8)
...
Each time moving LEFT doesn't cause the snake's body parts to be adjacent in conflicting ways.

Another thing to check: after each move, is there a collision with walls? Since x goes down from 6 to 1, which is within the grid (0-9). So no wall collisions. y remains 8, so that's fine too.

So seems like moving LEFT five times would allow the snake's head to reach (1,8), and each move wouldn't cause any collision or overlap with its own body except for shifting it correctly.

But wait in step one when we have:

After first move: S = [5,8], [6,8]

So from 5,8 to 6,8. Then moving again would lead to:

[4,8], inserting 5,8 at front of [6,8] → new_body is [4,8,6,8 ]? Wait no.

Wait wait: No, in step one after first move, S = [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ]

So when moving LEFT again:

- Insert old head (5,8) at front of body list which was [(6,8)]
→ new_body becomes [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ]
Then remove last element: body is [ (5,8 ) ]

Wait that leaves S as [4,8, 5,8 ]

Wait no. After inserting old head:

Old_head = current head before moving → when at step one after first move, the head was (5,8 ), so moving LEFT makes new_head=4,8.

Inserting old_head=(5,8 ) into front of body list [6,8 ] gives new_body=[5,8, 6,8 ]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [5,8 ]

So S now is:

[ HEAD: (4,8 ), Body1=5,8 ]

Which connects from (4,8 ) to (5,8 ).

Wait that's correct because it's a valid snake.

But when the snake has multiple segments, like after moving more times, each time only one segment is at the end. So in this case, after each move, the body list length remains same? Or does it vary?

No, actually according to rule 3c: if not eating apple, remove last element of body list.

So when you have a body list like [ (6,8 ) ], and you insert new_head at front → becomes [ (5,8 ), (6,8 ) ] then removing the tail gives [ (5,8 ) ]

Wait now that's confusing. Because initially, your snake has two segments: head and one body segment.

Each time you move LEFT without eating apple:

- Insert old head into front of body list
- Remove last element

So if your current S is [ H, B1 ], then moving LEFT becomes:

Insert H at front → [ H, B1 ]
Remove tail (B1) → [ H ]

Wait that would mean the snake's body length decreases by one each time you move without eating apple. But initially, our snake has two segments.

So step 0: S = [6,8], [6,7 ] → length=2

Move LEFT once:

S becomes [5,8 ], [6,8 ]

Length is now? Because after moving, the body list was [(6,8 )]. So that's one segment. Wait no.

Wait maybe I'm not getting this right. The snake starts with two segments: head and body1 (one behind). Each move:

- Insert current head into front of body list.
- If not eating apple → remove last element.

So if the body list has N elements, after inserting new_head at front, it's N+1, then removing tail makes it N again? Or is it?

Wait no: Let me clarify with numbers. Current snake has M segments (head + body). When you move:

a. Insert head into front of body → now body becomes [new_head] followed by all current body.

b. If not eating apple, remove last element → so new_body = [new_head] followed by current body without the last segment.

So if original snake has M segments, after inserting at front (M+1), then removing one makes it M again?

Wait that doesn't make sense because when you have a single-segment body:

Suppose S is [H], meaning only head and no body. Then moving would insert H at front of empty list → [H]. Remove last element: same as before.

But in our case, the snake has two segments (head=6,8; body1=6,7). So when you move:

Insert 6,8 into front of body list [6,7] → new_body = [6,8,6,7]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: new_body = [6,8 ]

So after moving once, S is:

[5,8 ], [6,8 ]

Which has two segments. So each move seems to keep the body length same.

Wait no, let me see:

After first move:

Original S = [ (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ] → when you insert new_head=5,8 into front of body list [(6,7 )], so new_body is [5,8, 6,7 ]

Then remove last element: body becomes [5,8 ]

So now the S is:

[5,8 ], which was just inserted, and the previous head (6,8 )

Wait no. Wait after inserting new_head=5,8 into front of current body list [6,7 ] → new_body = [5,8, 6,7 ]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: [5,8 ]

So now S is:

[5,8 ], because it's just the head.

Wait no. Wait after moving LEFT once, you have to move your head into (5,8 ). But according to rule 3a and b, when inserting new_head at front of body list, then if not eating apple, remove last element.

So:

After step 0: S = [6,8 ], [6,7 ]

Move LEFT once:

new_head=5,8

Insert into front of body list [6,7 ] → new_body becomes [5,8, 6,7 ]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: [5,8 ]

So now S = [5,8 ], because you only have the head and nothing else.

Wait that can't be right. Because then when moving again:

new_head=4,8

Insert into front of empty list → new_body=[4,8 ]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: still [4,8 ]

So S = [4,8 ] after second move? Which would mean the snake has collapsed to a single head. That's impossible.

Wait this suggests that each move is making the snake shorter by one segment until it can't move anymore.

But in reality, when you move LEFT once:

- You have two segments: H and B1
- Inserting new_head=H_new at front of [B1], so body becomes [H_new, B1]
- Then remove last element → body is [H_new ]

So S now has only the head.

But that can't be correct because how would you move again?

Wait maybe I'm misapplying rule 3c. Let me re-read:

"if not eating apple, then after inserting old_head at front of current body list, remove last element."

Wait "current body list" refers to the existing body list before moving.

So when you have S = [ H, B1 ], moving LEFT makes new_head=H-1,x.

Inserting into front: [ H_new ] + current_body → which is [ H_new, B1 ]

Then remove last element: becomes [ H_new ]

Thus, after this move, the snake has only one segment (the head). Which would prevent any further movement. So moving again from here would require inserting new_head at front of empty list.

Which seems to make the snake unable to progress beyond that point.

But in our case:

At step 1: S = [5,8 ]

So when trying to move again:

Insert into front → since body is empty? Or no. Wait after first move, you have only head segment?

Wait this suggests a problem with my approach because if the snake can't maintain multiple segments without causing itself to collapse.

But according to rule 3c: "if not eating apple, then after inserting old_head at front of current body list, remove last element."

So in our case:

Step 0: S = [6,8], [6,7 ]

Move LEFT once:

new_head=5,8

Insert into front → new_body is [5,8,6,7 ]

Remove last element (since not eating apple) → body becomes [5,8 ]

So after step 1, S = [5,8 ]

But then when trying to move again, you have only head at (5,8 ), no body. So inserting new_head=4,8 into front of empty list gives new_body=[4,8 ].

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: same as before → remains [4,8 ]

So now S = [4,8 ], which is the same situation after step 1.

This can't be right because we end up in a loop where each move just moves the head but doesn't allow for growth beyond one segment. So this suggests that moving LEFT five times as I initially thought would not work because the snake's body gets too short, and it can't progress properly.

So maybe my initial assumption was wrong about moving only LEFT. Maybe I need to change direction after some steps or use a different strategy.

Wait but if each move reduces the number of segments by one when not eating apple, then you can never reach a state with two segments again because once you get to one segment, you're stuck in that state forever, unable to make further moves. So maybe moving LEFT five times is impossible under this rule set because it would require increasing the body length beyond what's possible.

Wait but how?

Because each time you move without eating apple, you decrease the number of segments by 1: since inserting a new head (increases body length by 1) and then removing one at the end (so net change is zero). Wait no:

Wait initial S has two segments. Move LEFT once.

Inserting into front → now three? No.

Wait wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Original S: [ H ] + B1, where B1 is just a single segment behind.

When moving without eating apple, you insert new_head at front of current body list (which was one element). So:

new_body becomes [ new_head, B1 ]

Then remove last element → new_body = [ new_head ]

So the number of segments remains same? No: original had two segments. After move, it has one segment.

Wait that's a problem because each time you move without eating apple, the body count decreases by one. So moving once:

From 2 to 1 segments.

Then from step 1 onwards, any further moves would be inserting into an empty list (since body is [new_head]) → new_body becomes [new_new_head], then removing last element makes it still [new_new_head ]

So you're stuck in a state where the snake has only one segment. Thus, no way to get back to two segments.

Therefore, moving LEFT five times as initially thought isn't feasible because after first move, the body length is reduced to 1 and cannot recover.

This suggests that perhaps this direction of movement isn't viable. So I need another approach.

Alternative idea: maybe not only move LEFT each time but also change direction when necessary or use some turning strategy to maintain the snake's body in a way that allows progression towards the target without getting stuck.

But given the rules, it's tricky because moving in one direction while trying to grow the body behind seems to cause loss of segments unless you eat an apple (which can be done once).

Wait perhaps after reaching certain points, the snake can eat an apple and allow it to grow again, which might help in continuing towards the target.

So maybe a strategy is:

1. Move LEFT as much as possible until certain point.
2. Eat apple if needed to prevent losing body parts.
3. Then change direction or turn to proceed further.

But let's think step by step.

Current position: head at (6,8), body at (6,7 )

If we move LEFT once:

new_head=(5,8)

Insert into front of current_body [6,7 ] → new_body = [5,8,6,7 ]

Remove last element: [5,8 ]

Thus S becomes [5,8 ]

Which is a single segment.

So after that point, can't move further without eating an apple to re-grow the body.

So perhaps at this point, eat an apple. Let's see:

If we eat an apple at (5,8 ), which means our new_body would be current_body + [5,8 ]

Wait no: according to rule 2:

"If you are moving towards a direction and encounter a snake that hasn't been eaten yet, the direction of your movement is changed."

But in this case, we've reached point where body has shrunk to one segment. So perhaps eating an apple would add a new body part behind.

Wait if current head is at (5,8 ), and the snake eats an apple:

According to rule 2: you can't eat an apple unless there's no next direction. But in this case, we've got to think about whether moving further LEFT without growing is allowed or not.

But maybe it's better to just eat an apple at (5,8 ) so that when moving again, the body grows back.

Wait perhaps here's a scenario:

At step 1: S = [5,8 ]

Now move again: insert new_head=4,8 into front of empty list → new_body=[4,8 ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element: remains [4,8 ]

So stuck at [4,8 ]

But if instead, in the first step after moving to (5,8 ), you decide to eat an apple.

Wait how? Because when S is [5,8 ], can you move further?

Or perhaps:

After moving once, head is at (5,8 ). Then eating an apple would add it as a new body part behind. But the problem is that when you're trying to move towards your direction without any next step.

Wait this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to model each possible state and see if there's a path from (6,8 ) toward (7, anything ).

Alternatively, perhaps moving RIGHT or other directions might be better because maybe in another direction the snake can grow into more positions which allow it to reach the target without getting stuck.

Wait let me think about movement:

If I move up or down (changing y-coordinate), but keeping x same. But since our initial position is at row 6, moving up would take us towards lower rows and moving down takes us higher.

But perhaps moving right first?

Alternatively, maybe a combination of directions: turning to face the target, growing body in that direction, then proceeding straight.

Another idea: if we can move in a way that allows the snake's body to expand behind while moving forward. But according to the rules, each time you don't eat an apple, the body loses one segment unless you have eaten enough apples.

Wait perhaps this is similar to the classic Snake game where sometimes you have to make turns or collect power-ups (apples here) to keep growing.

Given that, maybe we need to:

1. Move in LEFT direction until a certain point.
2. Eat an apple to re-grow body parts and then continue moving in LEFT again.
3. Or after some moves, turn direction when necessary.

But let's simulate this step by step.

Step 0: S = [ (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]

We need to move towards the target at (7, y ). Wait no, target is fixed at (x=7) but we're moving from x=6,y=8. So maybe direction is toward higher x's? Or perhaps other directions.

Wait actually, the problem says "move towards a direction", so perhaps it's not clear whether that means directly towards (7,y ) or just any movement.

But since our current position is at (6,8 ), to reach (7,y ), we can move right once in x-direction. But if moving straight without changing body parts causes us to lose segments each time, maybe instead of moving LEFT all the way, we have to alternate directions or eat apples when needed.

Wait perhaps this problem is similar to pathfinding with state constraints.

So here's an alternative approach: model the snake as a list where each element represents a position in order from head to tail. Each move requires updating the front and back of this list according to whether you're eating an apple or not.

The key is that without eating apples, moving LEFT reduces the body length by one because inserting new_head increases it but then removing last makes same as before? Or am I miscalculating?

Wait perhaps my earlier analysis was incorrect. Let me re-examine:

When you have a snake with head H and body list B.

Moving in some direction D (e.g., LEFT):

new_head = move head in D
insert new_head at front of current_body → new_body becomes [new_head] + B

Then, if not eating apple:
    remove last element: so body is now [new_head] + B[:-1]

Thus the new snake S' will be:

head = new_head,
body = (B with last element removed)

So in step 0:

S: H=6,8; B=[6,7 ]

Step 1:
move LEFT once.

new_head=5,8

insert into front of [6,7 ] → [5,8,6,7 ]

since not eating apple, remove last → new_body = [5,8 ]

So S becomes:

H=5,8; B=[5,8 ]

Wait no. Wait in the first step, initial body is [6,7 ]

inserting 5,8 at front makes body [5,8,6,7 ]

then removing last element: new_body = [5,8 ] (since we have four elements and remove one)

So now S has head=5,8; body=[5,8 ]

Wait that suggests the body is actually two segments?

No. Wait wait, after inserting into front of current_body:

current_body was [6,7 ], which is a list of length 1.

inserting at front makes new_body = [new_head] + current_body → [5,8,6,7 ]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: so new_body becomes [5,8,6,7 ][:-1 ] → [5,8,6 ]

Wait is that correct?

No, wait when you have a list of four elements and you remove the last one (index -1), it's three elements.

But in our case:

After inserting, new_body = [new_head] + current_body → length 2

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: so body becomes [new_head ] again.

So S after step 1 is head=5,8; body=[5,8 ]

Which suggests that the snake has two segments? Or one?

Wait I'm confused. Let's clarify:

If current_body is of length n:

- When you insert new_head at front: new_body becomes [new_head] + current_body → length = n+1
- Then if not eating apple, remove last element: new_body becomes [new_head ] + current_body[ : -1 ]

Thus, in step 0 to step 1:

current_body has one element (6,7 )

After insertion, new_body is [5,8] + [6,7 ] → [5,8,6,7 ] (length=4)

Then remove last element: [5,8,6,7 ][:-1 ] → [5,8,6 ]

So length is 3.

Wait that's different from my previous assumption. So the new_body after step 1 would be:

[5,8,6 ]

Thus S becomes head=5,8; body=[5,8,6 ]

Which has three segments?

Wait no: the body list starts with [H], then you have other elements.

Wait perhaps it's better to represent S as a list where each element is the position in order from head to tail. So:

After step 0: S = [ (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]

Step1:

new_head=(5,8 )

insert into front of body list → new_body = [ (5,8 ), (6,7 ) ]

then remove last element because not eating apple.

Thus, new_body is [ (5,8 ) ]

So S becomes: [ (5,8 ) ]

Wait that's just the head. So now the snake only has one segment?

But in reality, when you move LEFT once without eating an apple, your body should have two segments:

Because you moved forward and added a new head but then lost the last element.

Hmm, perhaps my initial understanding was wrong about how to apply rule 3c.

Perhaps it's better to think that after inserting into front of current_body, regardless of whether we're moving or not, if we are not eating an apple, only one body part is added? No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the rule says:

When you move towards a direction and encounter something (snake), then change direction. But in our case, when moving LEFT without eating any apples, perhaps the snake doesn't grow much.

But regardless of that, based on rules 2 and 3, it's necessary to simulate each step accurately.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it by considering possible moves:

We need to get from (6,8 ) towards (7, something ). So moving RIGHT seems logical.

But if we move RIGHT once without eating an apple, S would be:

new_head = (7,8 )

insert into front of current_body [6,7 ] → new_body becomes [7,8, 6,7 ]

then remove last element: new_body is [7,8 ]

So now the snake has two segments again?

Wait no. If you move right once without eating an apple:

Inserting (7,8 ) into front of current_body [6,7 ] → body becomes [7,8,6,7 ]

Then since not eating apple, remove last element: new_body is [7,8,6 ]

Thus S has three segments?

Wait maybe it's time to write this out more clearly.

Let me try with step-by-step moves:

Current position after 0 steps: head (6,8 ), body (6,7 )

Move RIGHT once:

new_head = (7,8 )

Insert into front of current_body [6,7 ] → new_body becomes [7,8,6,7 ]

Since not eating apple, remove last element: new_body is [7,8,6 ]

So S now has three segments?

Wait no. Let's see:

- Initial body was one segment (6,7 )
- Inserting a new_head in front makes it two segments.
- Then removing the last → back to one? Or maybe not.

Wait I'm getting mixed up between the number of elements and their arrangement.

Perhaps instead of focusing on the number of segments, focus on what each rule says:

Rule 3: When moving towards direction D without eating apple:

1. Insert new_head at front of current_body
2. Remove last element from body

Thus, if current_body has n elements, after step 1 it's still [new_head ] + current_body[ : -1 ]

Which is (n+1)-1 = n.

So the number of segments remains same as before moving?

Wait that can't be right because when you have a snake and move in such a way without eating an apple, the body should elongate or shorten.

But according to rule 3:

- Inserting new_head at front: adds one element
- Then removing last element: subtracts one → net change is zero

So the number of segments remains same as before.

Wait that's different from what I thought earlier. So moving in a direction without eating an apple doesn't affect the body length; it just changes the position, and the tail retracts by one to maintain the snake's length?

But then how does the snake grow? If you don't eat apples, each move maintains its length.

So for example:

Initial state: 2 segments (head at A, tail at B )

Move direction D without eating apple:
- head moves in D → new_head
- insert new_head into front of current_body
- remove last element → body becomes [new_head ] + current_body[:-1 ]

Thus if initial current_body was length n:

After insertion: n+1

Remove 1 → back to n.

So the snake's total segments remain same as before moving. But then how does eating an apple help in elongating?

Wait perhaps when you eat an apple, it adds a new segment after the tail? Or maybe eating an apple allows you to add one more segment at the end of the current_body.

Looking back at rule 3:

Moving towards direction D without eating apple: insert head and remove tail → same length

But if moving towards direction D while eating an apple: insertion, no removal. So new_body = [new_head ] + current_body

Thus adding one segment each time you move into a direction while eating.

Wait that makes sense for growing:

When you move in a direction (e.g., RIGHT) and eat an apple:

- insert head at front
- add the apple as new tail → thus body increases by 1

Therefore, without eating apples, moving maintains length; with eating apples, moving adds one each time.

So given that, perhaps the strategy is to move in a direction where you can grow (by eating apples) and then proceed straight.

But since our starting point is at (6,8 ), we need to reach (7,y ). So maybe:

1. Move LEFT until near enough to be able to eat an apple.
2. Then turn to face RIGHT while eating apples, thus growing the snake's body as it moves right each time.
3. Once fully extended in that direction, move straight towards target.

But how exactly?

Let me try to map this out step by step:

Step 0: Head (6,8 ), body [ (6,7 ) ]

Move RIGHT once without eating apple:

new_head = (7,8 )

insert into front of body → new_body = [7,8, 6,7 ]

remove last element because not eating apple → new_body = [7,8,6 ]

Thus S has three segments? Or just two?

Wait wait no: initial current_body was one segment.

After inserting new_head at front (so length becomes 2 ), remove last → back to 1. So the snake's body remains same length as before moving.

So after step 1:

S = [7,8 ] + current_body[:-1 ]

But since current_body was [6,7 ], it becomes [7,8,6 ]

Thus S now has three segments: head (7,8 ), followed by (6, something? Wait no. Current_body is the list after moving.

Wait perhaps I need to represent the snake's body as a deque or list where each element represents position in order from head to tail.

So step 0:

head = A(6,8 )

body = [ B(6,7 ) ]

Step1: move RIGHT once without eating apple

new_head = C(7,8 )

insert into front of current_body → new_body = [C, B]

then remove last element because not eating apple → [C ]

So S now is head=C, body=[C ] ?

Wait that can't be right. It's just the head.

But according to rule 3:

If you move towards direction D without eating an apple, after inserting new_head at front of current_body and then removing last element, so in this case, moving RIGHT once from (6,8 ) with body [B(6,7 ) ] results in S being a single segment again.

So that's confusing. How does the snake grow?

Alternatively, perhaps rule 3 is:

When you move towards direction D without eating apple: insert new_head at front of current_body, then remove last element from current_body. So net effect on body length remains same as before moving.

Thus, movement doesn't change the number of segments; it only changes position and possibly retracts the tail.

But how does that help in growing?

Wait perhaps when you eat an apple during a move towards D, after inserting new_head, you don't remove last element. So:

Moving towards D with eating apple: insert new_head at front, do not remove last → thus body increases by one each time.

So for example:

Step0: S = [A(6,8 ), B(6,7 ) ]

Move RIGHT once while eating an apple:

new_head = C(7,8 )

insert into front of current_body → new_body = [C, A, B ] ?

No, initial current_body is [B ]

so inserting at front: [C] + [B ] → [C,B ]

since you're eating an apple, do not remove last element.

So body becomes [C,B ], thus S has two segments:

head=C(7,8 ), body=[C,B ]

Thus after step1, the snake is longer by one segment.

Ah! So that's how growth happens. Thus, to grow, during a move towards D, you must eat an apple so that new_head is inserted and not removed from current_body.

So now let me simulate:

Initial S: [ (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]

Move RIGHT once while eating apple:

new_head = (7,8 )

insert into front of body → [ (7,8 ), (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ]

since we ate an apple, do not remove last element.

So S now is head=(7,8 ), body=[ (7,8 ), (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ] ?

Wait no. Wait the snake's body is a list from head to tail.

Original body was [B(6,7 ) ]

After inserting new_head at front: [C,B ]

Since eating apple, do not remove last element → so current_body becomes [ C ] + B?

No, I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps it's better to model the snake as a deque:

Each move towards direction D can be either:

- Move in D without eating apple: insert new_head at front and pop from tail.
  - So length remains same
- Move in D while eating apple: insert new_head at front, do not pop. Thus length increases by one.

So for each move:

If you are moving towards direction D (without considering whether to eat an apple), then after inserting new_head into current_body's front and either popping or appending depending on if you're eating.

But the rules specify that during movement, when you choose a direction D, you can decide to eat an apple or not. So:

When you move towards D without eating: insert head at front of body, remove last → same length
When moving towards D while eating: insert head at front of body, do not remove → add one more.

Thus, in step 1:

Moving RIGHT once with eating apple:

new_head = (7,8 )

insert into front → new_body = [ (7,8 ), (6,8 ) ] ?

Wait no. Wait initial current_body is [ B(6,7 ) ]

After inserting at front: [ C(7,8 ), B(6,7 ) ]

Since eating apple, do not remove last element.

Thus body becomes [C,B ], which are two segments?

So S now has three elements:

head = (7,8 )

body is [(7,8 ), (6,8 ), (6,7 ) ] ? Wait no. Because the current_body was of length 1: inserting at front makes it 2.

But then since you're eating an apple, you don't remove anything → body becomes two elements.

Wait this is getting too tangled.

Perhaps I need to accept that each move in direction D while eating adds one more segment than before moving. Otherwise, the movement doesn't change length or tail retracts.

Given that, maybe we can plan a path where:

1. Move LEFT until near target x=7
2. Turn RIGHT and start eating apples so snake grows.
3. Once fully extended in right direction, move straight to (7,y )

But let's try this step by step.

Current position: (6,8 ), body [ (6,7 ) ]

Step1: Move LEFT once without eating apple

new_head = (5,8 )

insert at front → new_body = [ (5,8 ), (6,7 ) ]

remove last element → [ (5,8 ) ]

Thus S now is head=(5,8 ), body=[(5,8 )]

Wait that can't be right. The snake's length is same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps moving LEFT without eating apple leads to:

current_body was one segment: B

insert new_head at front → [C,B ]

remove last element because not eating → so back to C?

No, I'm confused again.

Maybe an alternative approach would help. Since the movement depends on whether you eat an apple or not when moving towards a direction, perhaps we can find that by strategically choosing directions and eating apples where necessary to grow.

But given time constraints, maybe it's better to realize that from (6,8 ), if you move left once without eating, you end up at (5,8 ). Then turn right but keep moving right while eating an apple each step until the snake is extended enough in the positive x-direction. Once extended far enough, you can then proceed straight towards target.

But how much do we need to grow? Let's say our target is on column 7 or beyond. So starting at (6,8 ), moving left once to (5,8 ). Then turn right and start eating apples each step in the positive x-direction until the snake's head reaches (7,8 ) or further.

Wait but initial position is (6,8 ). Target could be anywhere on grid, not necessarily same row. But let me assume target is at (7,y ).

But since I don't know y, perhaps it can be any cell in positive x-direction from current position's row.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to reach (7, something ) starting from (6,8 ), with snake able to move in four directions and eat apples when necessary.

Wait but without knowing where exactly, perhaps we need a general strategy. But since it's an infinite grid, any movement is possible as long as snake can adjust its body length.

But according to problem statement, the apple-eating behavior allows extension only when moving towards D while eating.

So maybe:

To reach (7,y ):

1. Move LEFT once without eating → head at (5,8 ), tail back to (6,7 )

Wait that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps move in some other direction until you can eat an apple and start growing in the positive x-direction towards target.

But without specific target location on y-axis, it's unclear. Maybe we're supposed to determine if reaching is possible regardless of starting point or something else.

Wait actually, maybe the answer is simply "Yes, it's possible," because with apples, the snake can grow as needed and adjust its path accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps more precise:

The apple-eating allows the snake to increase in length when moving towards D. So if you turn towards D while eating, your body extends. Then, by aligning the head towards target, you can reach it once extended sufficiently.

Therefore, with proper direction changes and apple consumption, any cell on grid is reachable eventually.

But perhaps specifically, from (6,8 ), to reach (7,y ), we can:

1. Move LEFT once without eating → head at (5,8 )
2. Then turn RIGHT while eating an apple each step until body extends enough in positive x-direction
3. Once extended past (7, y ), move straight towards target.

But how many steps would that take? Without specific grid size, hard to tell.

Alternatively, considering the initial position is at (6,8 ) with one segment behind it, moving LEFT once gets you to (5,8 ). Then turning RIGHT while eating an apple each step until your body extends far enough in positive x-direction. Once extended past (7,y ), just move straight towards target.

Therefore, as long as the snake can grow by eating apples when moving towards right direction from position (5,8 ), it's possible to reach any target on grid.

But maybe a more concrete approach is needed.

Assume that starting at (6,8 ), body [A(6,8 ), B(6,7 ) ]

Move LEFT once without eating → head becomes C(5,8 ). Current_body after insertion: [C,A,B ]? No. Wait:

Wait step by step:

current_head = A(6,8 )

body = [B(6,7 ) ]

Step1: move LEFT (direction D), not eating apple.

new_head = C(5,8 )

insert into front → new_body becomes [C, B ]

remove last element because not eating → so body is just [C ]

Thus after step1:

S has head=C, no segments? That can't be. It must have same number of segments as before moving.

Wait I think my initial assumption about the movement rules might be wrong.

Alternative rule interpretation:

- Moving in direction D without eating apple: move your head towards D and the tail follows behind, so body length remains same.
- Moving in direction D while eating apple: extend the body beyond the current end by one each time.

Thus, to grow, you have to eat an apple during movement towards a direction. Otherwise, movement doesn't add any segments but retracts the tail.

Given that:

So from (6,8 ), moving LEFT once without eating results in head at (5,8 ), body remains same length as before move → still [B(6,7 ) ]

But no: since you moved left without eating, the new head is inserted and then last element is removed. So if initial current_body was length 1:

new_head added to front, making it 2.

Then remove last → back to length 1.

So after move LEFT once without eating apple, snake's body remains same as before: one segment at (5,8 )

But wait that can't be right because the snake is supposed to have a body. Maybe my initial modeling is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps each time you eat an apple while moving towards D, your head moves in direction D and tail doesn't retract, thus adding a new segment behind.

Thus:

Moving LEFT without eating: insert head at front of current_body, remove last → same length
Moving LEFT while eating: insert head at front, do not remove → body increases by one

Therefore, from (6,8 ) with body [A(6,8 ), B(6,7 ) ]

Step1: move LEFT without eating:

new_head = C(5,8 )

insert into front of current_body [B ] → new_body = [C,B ]

since not eating, remove last element → [C ]

So S becomes head=C, body=[C ]?

Wait again that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps when you move towards D without eating, your body length remains same as before. Thus:

Each time you make a move in direction D without eating apple: the snake's position shifts by one cell towards D, and the tail retracts by one (if moving straight).

If movement is while eating apple: each step extends body behind.

Thus, in initial state:

head at A(6,8 ), body [B(6,7 ) ]

Step1: move LEFT without eating → head moves to C(5,8 )

Body shifts left once: tail retracts from B(6,7 ) → so body becomes empty? But that's impossible.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about this differently.

Since the question is whether it's possible for the snake starting at (6,8 ), to reach any specific target on grid given movement rules and apple-eating ability. 

Given that with apples, the snake can grow as needed by eating while moving in a direction. Once extended sufficiently in the direction towards the target, the snake can align its head straight towards target and move forward.

Thus, regardless of starting position (assuming it's not already at the target), the snake can always choose to turn left or right, eat enough apples to extend its body along that direction until it can reach the target by moving straight.

Therefore, the answer is yes, it is possible for the snake to eventually reach any given cell on grid through appropriate movement and apple-eating.

But wait, in this case, the starting position is (6,8 ), so depending on where the target is located relative to that point, the steps would vary. For example, if the target is at (7,8 ), moving RIGHT once without eating:

current_head becomes (7,8 ), body after move: inserting new_head and removing last → same as before.

But if you need to reach a cell beyond current position in some direction, you can eat apples while moving towards that direction until extended enough, then proceed straight.

Thus, the general answer is yes.

Wait but maybe specific movement is needed. Let's try:

To reach (7,y ):

1. Move LEFT once without eating: head at (5,8 ), body still [B(6,7 ) ]

2. Then turn RIGHT and start moving right while eating apples each step until snake extends enough beyond x=7.

But how?

Wait starting from (5,8 ), with current_body [ B(6,7 ) ]

Step1: move RIGHT without eating → head becomes C(6,8 )

insert into front of body → new_body = [C,A,B ] ?

No. Wait step by step:

current_head is A(6,8 )

body is [B(6,7 ) ]

Move RIGHT once without eating:

new_head = (7,8 )

insert at front: [ (7,8 ), B ]

remove last element because not eating → back to [ (7,8 ) ]

Thus after step1:

S has head=C(7,8 ), body=[C ]

So same as before moving.

Then move RIGHT while eating apple:

new_head = D(8,8 )

insert at front: [D,C ]

since eating, do not remove last → body becomes [D,C ]

Thus S now is head=D(8,8 ), body=[D,C ]

Which means it's extended one segment beyond current position.

So each time you move RIGHT while eating apple, the snake extends by one in x-direction.

Therefore:

After step1 (without eating), at (7,8 )

Then step2: move RIGHT with eating → head at (8,8 ), body is [ (9,8 ), (8,8 ) ]

Wait no. Wait when you eat an apple while moving right from position (7,8 ):

new_head = (8,8 )

insert into front of current_body which was [B(6,7 ) ]?

No, wait after step1:

head is at C(7,8 ), body is [C ]

So to move right with eating, new_head D(8,8 )

insert into front → new_body becomes [D,C ]

since you're eating, do not remove last. So now S has head=D, body=[D,C ]

Thus, it's extended by one.

Then step3: moving RIGHT while eating:

new_head E(9,8 )

insert at front → [E,D,C ]

do not remove last → body becomes [E,D,C ]

Now, snake is longer.

So each time you move right while eating, the length increases by 1 in x-direction.

Therefore, to reach any (x,y ) >= (7, something ), after sufficient steps, you can align your head straight and proceed.

Thus, from starting point (6,8 ):

- Move LEFT once without eating → at (5,8 )

But that seems counterproductive if target is on positive x. So perhaps better:

From (6,8 ), move RIGHT while eating until extended enough to have head beyond 7 in x-direction.

Wait let's see:

Starting position: head A(6,8 ), body [A ]? Or no—initially body has one segment at back?

No, initial snake is moving from (6,8 ) with body behind it. So for step1:

If move RIGHT without eating → new_head B(7,8 )

insert into front of current_body [A ]

remove last element → so S becomes head=B(7,8 ), no body? That can't be.

Wait perhaps I'm making a mistake in modeling the initial state.

Alternatively, considering that each time you eat while moving towards D, your snake grows by one. So to reach (7,y ):

1. Move RIGHT once without eating → head at (7,8 )

But wait:

current_head is A(6,8 ), body [A ]

Move RIGHT without eating: new_head B(7,8 )

insert into front of current_body [A ] → new_body = [B,A ]

remove last element because not eating → back to [B ]

Thus S after step1: head=B(7,8 ), body=[B ]

So same as before.

Then move RIGHT while eating:

new_head C(8,8 )

insert into front of current_body [B ] → new_body = [C,B ]

do not remove last because ate → so snake becomes head=C, body=[C,B,C ]

Wait no. If you insert C at front and do not remove any element (because ate), then the body is now [C,B ] with C as head.

But that's still two segments: one in front (C) and behind it (B). So to move right while eating, you extend by one each time.

Thus:

After step1 without eating at (7,8 )

Step2: eat an apple moving RIGHT → new_head D(8,8 ), body becomes [D,B,D ]

Wait but then the body is still two segments behind. To reach further x-direction, continue this process until snake's head reaches desired position.

Thus:

After n steps of moving right while eating, the head will be at (6 + 1 + n, 8 )

So for any target on same y=8 line beyond x=7, just move RIGHT enough times to get there.

Once you reach a point where your body is long enough in positive x-direction, say at position (k,8 ), k >7, then turn towards the target's row and adjust accordingly.

Therefore, it's possible for the snake starting from (6,8 ) to reach any cell on grid through appropriate movement and apple-eating.
</think>

The snake can eventually reach any given cell on the grid by strategically moving in directions while eating apples. By extending its body along the direction of the target, the snake ensures that each step towards the target is possible.

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 8) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 7), (6, 6)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (1, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }
