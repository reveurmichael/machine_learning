<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the snake can move from (6,6) to eat the apple at (7,5). Let me start by understanding the current state.

The head is at (6,6), and it's moving LEFT. The body cells are [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because if the head is at (6,6) and the first body cell is (7,6), which is to the right. But since the direction is LEFT, that doesn't make sense because moving left from 6 would go to 5, but the next body cell is (7,6), which is right.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body cells are ordered. The body list starts with the segment immediately behind the head, so if the head is at (6,6) and direction is LEFT, the next body cell should be to the left, like (5,6). But in this case, it's (7,6), which is to the right. That suggests that maybe the snake was moving right before turning, but I need to make sure about the movement rules.

Wait, no—the direction is LEFT now, so the head is moving left from (6,6) to (5,6). The body cells are [(7,6), ...], which would be behind the head if the snake was moving right. So perhaps the snake's previous move was RIGHT, but now it's turning LEFT.

But regardless of that, I need to plan a path for the snake to reach (7,5) without colliding with its own body and staying within bounds.

The apple is at (7,5). The head is currently at (6,6), which is one step left of the apple in terms of x-coordinate. So moving RIGHT once would get it to (7,6), but that's directly above the apple. Wait, no—the apple is at (7,5), so from (6,6), the head needs to move right and then down.

Wait, let me think about coordinates again. The grid has (0,0) at bottom-left and (9,9) at top-right. So moving UP increases y by 1. Therefore, (6,6) is somewhere in the middle. To get to (7,5), which is one step right and one step down.

So, from (6,6), moving RIGHT would take it to (7,6). Then moving DOWN would take it to (7,5).

But I need to check if this path is safe considering the body cells.

The current body cells are [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So after moving RIGHT from (6,6) to (7,6), the new head would be at (7,6). But the first body cell is also at (7,6), which means this move would cause a collision because the new head would coincide with BODY1. Therefore, that's not allowed.

So I can't just go RIGHT then DOWN because moving to (7,6) is blocked by the body.

Alternatively, maybe there's another path. Let me see.

What if the snake turns DOWN first? From (6,6), moving DOWN would take it to (6,5). Is that safe?

Looking at the current body cells: [(7,6), (7,5), ...]. So after moving down, the head would be at (6,5). Now, check if this position is occupied by any BODYi except possibly the tail.

The tail is currently at (8,2), which is far away. The other body cells are (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), etc. So (6,5) isn't in the body list, so that's safe.

So move DOWN to (6,5). Then from there, moving RIGHT once would take it to (7,5), which is the apple. But wait, after moving down and then right, let's see:

First move: DOWN to (6,5). Now, check for collision—safe because body cells are [(7,6), ...].

Second move: RIGHT to (7,5). Now, new head is at (7,5), which is the apple. So that should be a valid move.

But wait, after moving down to (6,5), what happens next? Let's think about the body updates.

When moving DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5):

1. New head is (6,5).
2. Check collision: no collision because (6,5) isn't in the body cells except possibly if it's the tail, but the tail is at (8,2), so safe.
3. Update body: since new_head is not apple position, we remove the tail.

Wait, wait—the apple is at (7,5). So when moving to (6,5) and then right to (7,5), which is the apple.

But let's think step by step:

First move: DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5).

Body after this move:

- Insert old head (6,6) into body list. So new body becomes [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)].

Wait no—the current body is [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), ...]. When moving down, the head moves to (6,5). Then:

a. Insert old head (6,6) at front → new body list starts with (6,6).

b. Since new_head is not apple position (apple is at (7,5)), we remove tail (8,2), so body becomes [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)].

Wait, but that's after inserting the old head. So original body was [B1=(7,6), B2=(7,5), ..., Bn=(8,2)]. After moving, new_head is (6,5). Then:

- Insert (6,6) as B1 → so now the body list is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)].

Then remove tail because not eating apple. So new body is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4)]. The tail is now at (8,4).

Wait no—no. Because the original body was length 6, after inserting the old head, it becomes 7, but since not eating apple, we remove the last element, so back to 6.

So after first move:

HEAD: (6,5)

BODY: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Wait no—wait. Original body is [B1=(7,6), B2=(7,5), ..., Bn=(8,2)].

After moving down, step 3a: insert old head (6,6) into front → new body list becomes [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].

Then since not eating apple, remove tail → [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)].

So after first move:

HEAD: (6,5)

BODY: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Now, in the next step, moving RIGHT to (7,5).

Check collision: new head is (7,5). The body after first move includes (7,5) as B2. So moving into that would cause a collision because new_head coincides with BODYi except possibly the tail when it moves.

Wait, but in this case, the body list after first move has (7,5) as B2. So moving into (7,5) is not allowed because it's part of the body.

Hmm, so that path doesn't work because after moving down and then right, the next head position would be on a body cell.

So I need another approach.

Alternative idea: find a way to move such that when the snake moves towards the apple, the body doesn't block the path.

Looking at the current setup:

Head is at (6,6), direction is LEFT. The body cells are [(7,6), (7,5), ...]. So after moving left from head, the new head would be (5,6). But wait, that's not towards the apple.

Wait no—the apple is at (7,5), which is to the right and down from the head. So perhaps I should avoid moving left because it takes me away from the apple.

So maybe changing direction from LEFT to another direction.

But according to movement rules, can't reverse direction immediately. Current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT (since LEFT and RIGHT are reverses). Wait, no—the rule says cannot reverse: if current direction is UP, can't choose DOWN, etc. So if current direction is LEFT, can't choose RIGHT.

So from LEFT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or stay LEFT? Or perhaps any except the opposite.

Wait, I think the rules say you can't move in the exact opposite direction. So if moving LEFT, next move can be UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.

But wait, in some implementations, turning around (like from LEFT to RIGHT) is allowed after a certain time, but according to the problem statement, it's forbidden to reverse direction immediately.

So current direction is LEFT; possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT again. Can't move RIGHT.

Wait no, that depends on how the movement is defined. If the snake can change direction any way except moving back along the previous segment, which would cause collision with itself.

But according to the problem's initial description, it's a classic snake game where you can't reverse direction into the body. So from LEFT, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (if possible without self-collision).

So in this case, moving LEFT again might take me towards (5,6), but I need to check if that's safe.

Alternatively, maybe turning DOWN first would allow a path.

Wait, another approach: let the snake make a U-turn by changing direction in steps. For example, move LEFT once, then RIGHT, but according to rules, can't reverse immediately.

Hmm, perhaps not possible.

Alternative idea: plan a path that goes around the body.

From (6,6), moving DOWN would take it to (6,5). Then from there, moving RIGHT twice: first to (7,5) which is apple. But wait, as before, moving to (7,5) is blocked because (7,5) is a body cell after the first move.

Alternatively, perhaps move DOWN, then RIGHT, then UP? Not sure.

Wait, let's think differently. The apple is at (7,5). So from (6,6), need to go right and down.

But directly moving right is blocked by body cell (7,6) in current state.

So alternative path: move down first to (6,5), then right to (7,5).

Wait, but as before, after moving down to (6,5), the next move right would take head to (7,5), which is apple. But in this case, the body cell at (7,5) is still present.

So perhaps I need to wait until the body cells have moved past that point.

Wait, how does the body move? Each time the head moves, the body follows: each segment takes the position of the previous one.

So after moving down from (6,6) to (6,5), the old head (6,6) becomes part of the body. Then when I move right next, the new head is at (7,5), and the body would have shifted accordingly.

Wait no—the body cells are processed each time: when the head moves, all body segments follow by moving into the previous segment's position, except for the last one which is removed if not eating.

So let me try to simulate the first two moves:

Initial state:
HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]

Move 1: DOWN → HEAD becomes (6,5).
Check collision: (6,5) is not in body except if it's the tail. The tail is at (8,2), so no collision.
Update body:
- Insert (6,6) at front → [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]
- Remove last element (8,2) because not eating apple. So new body is [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Wait, no—the original body was 6 cells: [B1=(7,6), B2=(7,5), B3=(8,5), B4=(8,4), B5=(8,3), B6=(8,2)]. After moving DOWN:

- New HEAD is (6,5)
- Insert old head (6,6) into body: new body starts with (6,6), followed by previous B1 to B6.

But since not eating apple, we remove the last element (B6=8,2). So new body becomes [ (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

So after first move:

HEAD: (6,5)
BODY: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Now, move 2: RIGHT → HEAD becomes (7,5).

Check collision: is (7,5) in the body except possibly the tail? The current body has (7,5) as B3. So new head would be at (7,5), which is part of the body.

Thus, collision occurs—invalid move.

So that path doesn't work.

Alternative idea: can the snake take a different route? Maybe go down twice before moving right?

Let me try:

Move 1: DOWN → HEAD (6,5)
BODY becomes [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Move 2: DOWN again → HEAD (6,4)

Check collision: is (6,4) in body? Current body after move1: [ (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

So (6,4) is not in the body. So safe.

Update body:

- Insert old head (6,5) → new body starts with (6,5)
- Since not eating apple, remove last element (8,3). So new body is [ (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4) ]

Now, move 3: RIGHT → HEAD becomes (7,4)

Check collision: body after move2 is [ (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4) ]

(7,4) is not in the body. So safe.

Update body:

- Insert old head (6,4)
- Remove last element (8,4). New body: [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5) ]

Move 4: RIGHT → HEAD becomes (8,4)

Check collision: body after move3 is [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5) ]

(8,4) is not in the body. So safe.

Update body:

- Insert old head (7,4)
- Remove last element (8,5). New body: [ (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5) ]

Now, move 5: UP → HEAD becomes (8,5)

Check collision: body is [ (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5) ]

(8,5) is not in the body. So safe.

Update body:

- Insert old head (8,4)
- Remove last element (7,5). New body: [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6) ]

But now, after all these moves, the snake is at (8,5), which is one step away from the apple at (7,5). So move 6: LEFT → HEAD becomes (7,5).

Check collision: body after move5 is [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6) ]

(7,5) is not in the body. So safe.

Thus, by moving down twice and then right twice, then up once, and left once, the snake can reach the apple without collision.

But this seems like a lot of moves. Is there a shorter path?

Alternatively, perhaps after move1 (DOWN to 6,5), instead of moving further down, maybe turn around.

Wait, but movement is constrained by direction—can't reverse immediately.

So initial direction is LEFT; possible next directions are UP or DOWN.

If I go DOWN first, then can I change direction later?

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: the snake needs to navigate around its own body. Since the apple is at (7,5), and the current body blocks direct right movement, maybe moving down and then right twice, but as above.

Wait, but in the initial state, the body cells include (7,6), which is directly to the right of the head. So if I can clear that path somehow.

Alternatively, think about whether the snake's body will move away from (7,5) before moving there.

But each time the head moves, the body follows.

Wait, perhaps in two steps:

Move 1: DOWN to (6,5). Now, body includes (6,6).

Move 2: RIGHT to (7,5), which is apple. But as before, this causes collision because (7,5) is in the body after move1.

So not possible.

Alternative idea: make the snake move in a way that the body part at (7,5) moves away before moving there.

But how?

Perhaps by making the head go around and causing the body to shift so that (7,5) is no longer occupied when needed.

Wait, perhaps another approach:

From (6,6), initial direction is LEFT. Let's move LEFT once:

Move 1: LEFT → HEAD becomes (5,6).

Check collision: body was [(7,6), ...], which is now shifted to (6,6) as first segment.

So new body after moving left would be [ (5,6), (7,6), (7,5), ... ] Wait no—the movement should cause each segment to follow the previous one.

Wait, when you move LEFT, the head goes to (5,6). The old head (6,6) becomes part of the body. So the new body is [ (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) ]? Wait no—the initial body had 6 segments. When moving, each segment follows.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to simulate the move:

Initial state:
HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]

Move 1: LEFT → HEAD becomes (5,6).

Now, the body segments update as follows:

Old head was at (6,6). The first segment (7,6) moves to where the old head was, i.e., (6,6). Then the next segment (7,5) moves to (7,6), and so on.

So new body after move1 is [ (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) ]

Wait no—the number of segments remains the same. So moving left adds a new segment at (5,6), and the last segment is removed.

So correct process:

When you move, the head moves to new position. Then each body part moves to where the previous one was, except the last one which is lost unless food is eaten.

But since we're not eating food here, the length remains same.

Wait no—the snake's length remains constant (assuming standard gameplay where moving doesn't change length unless food is eaten).

So when head moves, each segment follows:

Original body: [B1=(7,6), B2=(7,5), B3=(8,5), B4=(8,4), B5=(8,3), B6=(8,2)]

After moving LEFT to (5,6):

New head is at (5,6).

Each body part moves:

B1 moves to where head was: (6,6)
B2 moves to where B1 was: (7,6)
B3 → (7,5)
B4 → (8,5)
B5 → (8,4)
B6 → (8,3)

But since we have 6 segments now:

New body is [ (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

So after move1:

HEAD: (5,6)
BODY: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)]

Now, in this state, can we move RIGHT?

Yes, because current direction is LEFT; moving RIGHT would be reversing direction which might not be allowed.

Wait, but the problem says you cannot reverse direction immediately. So from LEFT, you can't go to RIGHT next.

Thus, possible directions after moving LEFT are UP or DOWN.

So let's try:

Move 2: DOWN → HEAD becomes (5,5)

Check collision: body is [ (6,6), ... ] which doesn't include (5,5). So safe.

Update body:

Insert old head (5,6) at front. Remove last segment (8,3).

New body: [ (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4) ]

Now, move 3: DOWN again → HEAD becomes (5,4)

Check collision: body doesn't include (5,4). Safe.

Update body:

Insert (5,5) at front. Remove last segment (8,4).

New body: [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5) ]

Move 4: RIGHT → HEAD becomes (6,4)

Check collision: body doesn't include (6,4). Safe.

Update body:

Insert (5,4) at front. Remove last segment (8,5).

New body: [ (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5) ]

Move 5: RIGHT → HEAD becomes (7,4)

Check collision: body is [ ... ] which doesn't include (7,4). Safe.

Update body:

Insert (6,4) at front. Remove last segment (7,5).

New body: [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) ]

Move 6: RIGHT → HEAD becomes (8,4)

Check collision: body is [ ... ] which doesn't include (8,4). Safe.

Update body:

Insert (7,4) at front. Remove last segment (7,6).

New body: [ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) ]

Move 7: UP → HEAD becomes (8,5)

Check collision: body is [ ... ] which doesn't include (8,5). Safe.

Update body:

Insert (8,4) at front. Remove last segment (6,6).

New body: [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) ]

Now, move 8: LEFT → HEAD becomes (7,5)

Check collision: body is [ ... ] which doesn't include (7,5). Safe.

Thus, after these eight moves, the snake reaches (7,5).

But this seems too long. Is there a more efficient way?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of steps is 3 or something.

Wait, but from initial position, moving right is blocked. So need to go around.

Perhaps move DOWN twice and RIGHT once:

Move1: DOWN → HEAD (6,5)
Move2: DOWN → HEAD (6,4)
Move3: RIGHT → HEAD (7,4)

But this doesn't reach the apple yet.

Alternatively, perhaps a different approach is needed. Maybe after moving down, the body part at (7,5) will have moved, allowing access to it.

Wait, let's think about how the body moves:

Each time you move, all body segments follow except for the last one if not eating food.

So in initial state:

HEAD: (6,6)
BODY: [ (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) ]

If we can move such that the body segment at (7,5) moves away before moving into it.

For example:

Move1: DOWN → HEAD (6,5)
BODY becomes [ (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) ]

Now, the body has a segment at (7,5). So moving RIGHT would cause collision.

But if we move again DOWN:

Move2: DOWN → HEAD (6,4)
BODY becomes [ (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4) ]

Now, the body still has (7,5). But now, if we move RIGHT twice:

Move3: RIGHT → HEAD (7,4)
BODY becomes [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5) ]

Move4: RIGHT → HEAD (8,4)
BODY becomes [ (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5) ]

Now, moving UP would take HEAD to (8,5)

Move5: UP → HEAD (8,5)
BODY becomes [ (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6) ]

Then move LEFT:

Move6: LEFT → HEAD (7,5)

Now, check collision: body after move5 is [ ... ] which doesn't include (7,5). So safe.

Thus, it takes six moves to reach the apple.

Alternatively, is there a way to reach it in fewer steps?

Let me try another path:

Move1: LEFT → HEAD (5,6)
BODY becomes [ (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), ... ]

Now, can't move RIGHT as per rules (can't reverse immediately).

So directions available are UP or DOWN.

Move2: DOWN → HEAD (5,5)
BODY becomes [ (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), ... ]

Move3: DOWN → HEAD (5,4)
BODY becomes [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5) ... ]

Move4: RIGHT → HEAD (6,4)
BODY becomes [ (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5) ]

Move5: RIGHT → HEAD (7,4)
BODY becomes [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) ]

Move6: UP → HEAD (7,5)

Now, check body segments. After move6, the body is:

[ (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) ]

So (7,5) is not occupied by any body segment, so safe.

Thus, same six moves.

It seems that regardless of initial direction taken (DOWN or LEFT), it takes at least six moves to reach the apple without collision.

Therefore, the minimal number of steps needed is 6.
</think>

The minimal number of steps required for the snake to move from its starting position to the target position (7,5) without colliding with itself is 6. 

$\boxed{6}$

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (6, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (7, 5). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
