========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

To solve this problem, we need to plan a path for the snake's head to reach the apple at (2,7) from its current position at (5,7), while adhering to all movement rules and constraints.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Head Position: (5, 7)
   - Current Direction: UP
   - Body Cells: [(5, 6)]
   - Apple Position: (2, 7)

2. **Path Planning Considerations:**
   - The snake must not reverse direction on the first move.
   - We need to avoid collisions with walls and its own body.
   - After eating the apple, ensure there's at least one legal move.

3. **Movement Calculation:**
   - To reach from (5, 7) to (2, 7), we need to move LEFT three times.

4. **Path Validation:**
   - Check if each step is safe and doesn't cause a collision.
   - Ensure the path adheres to the rules of not reversing direction on the first move.

Given these considerations, let's construct the moves:

1. Start at (5, 7) moving UP.
2. Move LEFT three times to reach (2, 7).

Here is the JSON object with the calculated moves and reasoning:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Move left three times from (5, 7) to (2, 7), adhering to movement rules without reversing direction initially."
}
```

This path ensures that we reach the apple safely while avoiding any collisions with walls or the snake's body.
