========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move down 7 times to reach the apple at (1,0) from (1,7). Each downward move is safe as the head does not collide with the body (which shifts upward each time) and stays within grid bounds. After the final move, the snake eats the apple, grows, and has valid next moves (left/right) avoiding entrapment."
