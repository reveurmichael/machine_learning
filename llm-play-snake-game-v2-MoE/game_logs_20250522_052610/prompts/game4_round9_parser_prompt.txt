<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to help this snake reach the apple without dying. So, the current head position is (4, 2), and the apple is at (0,9). That's quite a journey. The body of the snake is currently at [(5,3), (5,2)]. 

First, I need to understand the direction the snake is moving. It's currently going LEFT, so from (5,2) to (4,2). But when making moves, the snake can't reverse direction immediately. So if it was moving LEFT before, the next move can't be RIGHT or DOWN? Wait, no—the movement rules say you can't reverse direction. Since the current direction is LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. Wait, no—reversing would mean going in the opposite direction of where you're currently facing. So if moving LEFT, reversing would be moving RIGHT because that's the opposite direction along the x-axis. But actually, I think the movement rules prevent the snake from changing direction to the exact opposite. For example, if it's going UP, it can't go DOWN next.

So, the current direction is LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT (the opposite) or maybe any other direction? Wait, no—the rule says you cannot reverse direction, meaning you can't immediately turn around 180 degrees. So from LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT. But it can go UP or DOWN because those are perpendicular directions.

But in this case, the initial direction is LEFT. So for the first move, since current direction is LEFT, the next move cannot be RIGHT. That's an important constraint.

Now, let's think about the path from (4,2) to (0,9). The apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units to the left and 7 units up. So the snake needs a net movement of 4 LEFTs and 7 UPs. But each move affects the body, so we have to make sure that after each step, the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body.

The body is currently [(5,3), (5,2)]. When the snake moves, the head becomes part of the body, except when it eats an apple. So if it moves in such a way that the new head position collides with any existing body cell, it dies. Also, moving outside the grid kills it.

Looking at the initial position: Head is (4,2), direction is LEFT. The next move can't be RIGHT. So options are UP or DOWN or maybe something else?

Wait, from (4,2), if we go UP, that's to (4,3). Let's check if that's safe.

After moving UP, the new head would be at (4,3). The body becomes [(5,3), (4,2)]. Wait no—wait, when you move, the head moves first, then the body follows. So after moving, the new head is added to the front of the body list, and the tail is removed unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, let's clarify:

- When the snake moves, it adds a new head based on direction.
- The previous head becomes part of the body (except if it ate an apple in that move).
- So after moving, each segment follows the next one.

But for collision detection, we need to check whether the new head position is already occupied by any existing body segments or walls.

So, starting at (4,2), moving UP would take the head to (4,3). The body is currently [(5,3), (5,2)]. So after moving, the new body would be [(5,3), (4,2)] and the head is now (4,3). Wait no—when you move, the body shifts. Let me think again.

Wait, initial state: Head at (4,2), direction LEFT, so the previous moves were LEFT from (5,2) to (4,2). The body is [(5,3), (5,2)]. So when moving next, if we go UP:

- New head is (4,3)
- Then, the body becomes [head_old, ...], but wait no. Let me get this right.

When you make a move, the snake's body shifts: each segment moves into the position of the previous one. The tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

So, current state:

Head: (4,2)
Body: [(5,3), (5,2)]

After moving UP to (4,3):

- New head is (4,3)
- Then, each body segment moves forward: the first body cell (5,3) becomes (4,3)? Wait no. No, wait—the body follows the head.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the movement:

Current positions:

Head: (4,2)

Body cells: [(5,3), (5,2)].

So when moving in a direction, the head moves first. Then, each body cell follows the path of the previous one.

If we move UP from (4,2):

- New head: (4, 3)
- The old head (4,2) becomes the next body segment.
- The previous body cells [(5,3), (5,2)] become [ (4,2), (5,3) ]? Or do they shift in the order?

Wait, perhaps after moving, the new head is added to the front of the body list. Then, the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

So, initial body: [(5,3), (5,2)]. When moving UP:

- New head: (4,3)
- Body becomes [ (4,2), (5,3) ] because each segment follows the previous one.

Wait, no. Let me think step by step:

When moving, the head moves in the new direction. Then, all body segments move to the position of the previous segment. The last segment (tail) is removed unless an apple was eaten.

So, after moving UP from (4,2):

- New head: (4,3)
- Body cells become [ (4,2), (5,3) ]? Or perhaps [(5,3), (4,2)]?

Wait, no. Let me think of it as a queue. The head is at the front, and each body cell follows in order.

So, initial state: head is (4,2). Body cells are [(5,3), (5,2)]. So when moving UP:

- Head moves to (4,3)
- Then, each body cell moves into the position of the previous one.

So the new body after movement would be [ (4,2), (5,3) ]? Or perhaps [ (5,3), (4,2) ]?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a list where each element is the next segment. So when moving, the head moves first, then each segment takes the position of the previous one.

So initial body: [(5,3), (5,2)].

After moving UP:

- Head becomes (4,3)
- The new body is [ (4,2) ] + [(5,3), (5,2)]? Or no.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the movement as follows: when the snake moves in a direction, each segment follows the next one, and the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten.

So, initial body: [B1, B2], where B1 is (5,3), B2 is (5,2).

After moving head to (4,3):

- The new head is (4,3)
- The old head (4,2) becomes the first body segment.
- Then, each body cell moves: B1 (5,3) becomes (4,2) because it follows the previous head.

Wait no—because when the head moves, all body segments move in the same way. So if the head was at (4,2), and you move UP to (4,3), then each segment moves towards the new head.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a chain: each segment follows the one in front of it.

So, when moving from (4,2) to (4,3):

- Head is now at (4,3)
- The previous head (4,2) becomes part of the body.
- Then, the next segments move into their positions.

Wait, but initially, the body is [(5,3), (5,2)]. So when moving UP:

The new positions would be:

Head: (4,3)

Body cells: [(5,3), (5,2)] → each moves to the position of the segment in front of them. But wait, how?

Actually, perhaps it's easier to think that after the head moves, each body cell takes the place of the previous one. So:

After moving UP:

- Head is at (4,3)
- The first body cell (5,3) moves to where the head was: (4,2)
- The second body cell (5,2) moves to (5,3)

Wait, but that would cause the new body cells to be [(4,2), (5,3)]. So after moving UP:

Body becomes [ (4,2), (5,3) ].

But then, when checking for collision, we need to ensure that the new head (4,3) is not in any of these positions. In this case, it's safe because (4,3) is not in [(4,2), (5,3)].

So moving UP seems okay.

But wait, let's check if there are any obstacles. After moving UP to (4,3), the new head is at (4,3). The body cells after this move would be [ (4,2), (5,3) ]? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the movement works as follows: each segment moves into the position of the previous one. So when moving UP:

- Head was at (4,2)
- Moves to (4,3)
- Body cell (5,3) moves to (4,2)
- Body cell (5,2) moves to (5,3)

So after this move, the body is [ (4,2), (5,3) ]

Wait, but that would mean the snake's body now includes (4,2) and (5,3). So when moving again, we have to make sure the new head doesn't collide with these positions.

But in any case, moving UP initially seems possible. However, I need to plan a path that gets the snake all the way to (0,9) without colliding with its own body and without going out of bounds.

Let me map out the grid:

The apple is at (0,9), which is top-left corner. The snake starts at (4,2). So the distance is 4 left and 7 up.

But the movement can't just be all LEFTs and UPs because that might cause collisions with the body or walls.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a spiral or some pattern to avoid obstacles.

Wait, but considering the constraints on direction changes. Since the initial direction is LEFT, the first move cannot be RIGHT. So from LEFT, possible moves are UP or DOWN.

But moving DOWN would take it further away from the apple's y-coordinate (which is 9). The apple is at a higher y-value, so we need to go UP. Therefore, perhaps moving UP initially is better.

So let's consider starting with UP.

First move: UP → (4,3)

Now, after this move, the body cells are [(5,3), (4,2)]?

Wait no—when you move, the head moves first, then each body cell follows. So initial state:

Head: (4,2)
Body: [B1=(5,3), B2=(5,2)]

After moving UP to (4,3):

- New head: (4,3)
- B1 moves to where the old head was: (4,2)
- B2 moves to where B1 was: (5,3)

So after this move, body cells are [ (4,2), (5,3) ]

Now, check for collision. The new head is (4,3). Body cells are [(4,2), (5,3)]. So does (4,3) collide with any of these? No.

Next move: Now the direction was LEFT, but after moving UP, the current direction becomes UP.

Wait no—the current direction changes based on the movement. Wait, initial direction is LEFT, so the first move can't be RIGHT. But when you make a move that's not opposite, then the new direction is set to that move.

So, from LEFT, next move is UP, which is allowed because it's not opposite (opposite of LEFT would be RIGHT).

After moving UP, the current direction becomes UP.

Now, for the second move: From (4,3), direction is UP. What are the possible moves? Since last direction was UP, next move can't be DOWN.

So from UP, you can go LEFT, RIGHT, or stay in UP?

Wait no—the movement rules say that the snake cannot reverse direction. So if it's moving UP now, it can't move DOWN next. But it can change to any other direction except DOWN.

But wait, after each move, the current direction becomes the direction taken. So initial direction is LEFT; first move is UP → new direction is UP.

So second move: from UP, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE? Wait no—the movement options are "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT" unless NONE was the previous direction.

Wait, the current direction after moving UP is UP. So next moves cannot be DOWN.

But wait, let me clarify:

- If the snake's current direction is "NONE" (which it isn't here), any move is allowed.
- Otherwise, when changing direction, you can't reverse. For example, if you were going LEFT and change to RIGHT, that's reversing and is not allowed.

So in this case, since the current direction is UP after first move, next moves can be LEFT, RIGHT, or remain UP? Or wait—can it turn around?

Wait no, because the rule says cannot reverse direction. So from UP, you can't go DOWN (which would be reversing), but you can change to LEFT or RIGHT.

So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or stay in UP.

But moving further UP might take us closer to the apple's y-coordinate of 9. Let's see: current head is at (4,3). To get to (0,9), we need to move 7 times UP and 4 times LEFT.

So perhaps it's better to continue moving UP for a few steps before turning left or right.

Second move: UP → (4,4)

Now, body after second move:

- Head moves from (4,3) to (4,4)
- Previous head (4,3) becomes part of body
- Body cells [ (4,2), (5,3) ] move as follows:
  - First body cell (4,2) moves to (4,3)
  - Second body cell (5,3) moves to (4,2)

Wait no—I think I need a better way to track this.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the snake moves in a direction, it's added as a new segment at the front, and the last segment is removed unless an apple is eaten. But since there's no mention of eating apples here, we can assume that each move adds a new head and removes the tail.

Wait, but without knowing if the snake grows or not, perhaps in this problem, the snake moves by adding one segment to the front and removing one from the end.

So initial body: [ (5,3), (5,2) ]

After first move UP:

- Head is at (4,3)
- Body becomes [ (4,2), (5,3) ]

Because the previous head (4,2) was added to the front, and the last segment (5,2) was removed.

Wait no—if each movement adds a new head and drops the tail, then:

Each move, the snake's body is extended by one in the direction of movement, and the last segment is dropped.

So, initial state: head at (4,2), body [B1=(5,3), B2=(5,2)]

After moving UP to (4,3):

- New head: (4,3)
- Body becomes [ (4,3) ] + [B1, B2]? No.

Wait no—snake moves by each segment following the previous one. So when you move in a direction, each body cell takes the position of the cell in front.

So perhaps the process is:

When moving from current head to new head, each segment takes the place of the one before it.

Thus, initial positions:

Head: (4,2)
Body1: (5,3)
Body2: (5,2)

After moving UP to (4,3):

- New head: (4,3)
- Body1 moves from (5,3) to (4,2) → where the old head was
- Body2 moves from (5,2) to (5,3) → where Body1 was

Thus, body after move UP:

Body1: (4,2)
Body2: (5,3)

So new positions are:

Head: (4,3)
Body1: (4,2)
Body2: (5,3)

No collision with head because (4,3) is not in [(4,2), (5,3)]

Similarly, next move UP to (4,4):

- New head: (4,4)
- Body1 moves from (4,2) to (4,3)
- Body2 moves from (5,3) to (4,2)

So body becomes:

Body1: (4,3)
Body2: (4,2)

Wait no—after moving UP again, the new head is at (4,4). Then each body cell follows.

Thus, initial after first move:

Head: (4,3)
Body1: (4,2)
Body2: (5,3)

After second move UP to (4,4):

- Head: (4,4)
- Body1 moves from (4,2) to (4,3)
- Body2 moves from (5,3) to (4,2)

Thus, body becomes:

Body1: (4,3)
Body2: (4,2)

So no collision again.

Continuing this way, the snake can move up step by step.

But moving only UP might not be the most efficient. Since we need to go 7 UPs and 4 LEFTs, perhaps it's better to plan a path that avoids crossing itself.

Alternatively, perhaps after some steps, turn left or right to avoid collisions.

Wait, but considering the body is only two segments at first, as the snake moves, more segments are added. So we need to make sure that each new head doesn't land on any part of the current body.

So perhaps planning a path where the snake makes turns in such a way that it doesn't intersect with itself.

Alternatively, given that without growing (assuming no food), the snake's length remains two, as each move adds a new head and removes the tail. So the body is always just [previous head] + [body].

Wait no—if each movement only shifts positions, then the length of the snake remains the same unless it grows.

But in this problem, we aren't told about food or growth, so perhaps the snake's body doesn't change length when moving—each segment follows the previous one. So the length remains the same as initial—three segments? Wait, initial state is head + two body cells: four segments total?

Wait no—the initial description was that the snake is at (4,2) with body cells at (5,3) and (5,2). So it's a three-segment snake.

But when moving, each new position adds to the front and removes from the end. So length remains constant unless food is eaten.

So if the snake doesn't eat, its length stays as three segments: head + two body cells.

Thus, in our case, movement continues with the same length.

Therefore, perhaps it's manageable to move step by step towards (0,9) without crossing itself.

But let me try to plan a path:

Starting at (4,2), first move UP to (4,3).

Next move: Continue UP to (4,4)

Then UP to (4,5), and so on until y=9.

Wait, but that would require 7 UP moves. Let's see:

1. Move UP to (4,3)
2. Move UP to (4,4)
3. Move UP to (4,5)
4. Move UP to (4,6)
5. Move UP to (4,7)
6. Move UP to (4,8)
7. Move UP to (4,9)

But wait, y=9 is the target y-coordinate. So after 7 moves up from y=2, we reach y=9.

Now, at this point, the snake's head is at (4,9), and needs to move LEFT four times to x=0.

So:

8. Move LEFT to (3,9)
9. Move LEFT to (2,9)
10. Move LEFT to (1,9)
11. Move LEFT to (0,9)

But wait, after each move, we need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body.

Let's check:

After 7 UP moves:

Each move adds a new head at (4,y), where y increases by 1, and the tail is removed.

So after moving UP seven times, starting from (4,2):

- Move 1: (4,3)
- Move 2: (4,4)
- ...
- Move 7: (4,9)

At each step, the body is [previous head] + [other segments], but since we're only moving straight up, the body won't cross itself.

But when starting to move LEFT from (4,9), let's see:

After move 8: LEFT to (3,9). The body cells are now [(4,8), (4,7)]? Or perhaps not. Wait, let's track it step by step.

Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to model the path and ensure no self-intersections.

Alternatively, since we're moving straight up for seven steps, then left four steps, and each time only adding one segment at the front and losing one from the end, as long as the path doesn't overlap with itself, it should be okay.

But let's see:

When moving from (4,9) to (3,9), what is the body?

Before move 8:

- Head: (4,9)
- Body1: (4,8)
- Body2: (4,7)

After moving LEFT to (3,9):

- New head: (3,9)
- Body1 moves from (4,8) to (4,9) → which is where the old head was
- Body2 moves from (4,7) to (4,8)

Thus, body becomes:

Body1: (4,9)
Body2: (4,8)

So new positions are:

Head: (3,9)
Body1: (4,9)
Body2: (4,8)

No collision because head is at (3,9), which is not in [ (4,9), (4,8) ]

Similarly, next move LEFT to (2,9):

- Head moves from (3,9) to (2,9)
- Body1 moves from (4,9) to (3,9)
- Body2 moves from (4,8) to (4,9)

Body becomes:

Body1: (3,9)
Body2: (4,9)

So head is at (2,9), body cells are [(3,9), (4,9)] → no collision.

Next move LEFT to (1,9):

- Head moves from (2,9) to (1,9)
- Body1 moves from (3,9) to (2,9)
- Body2 moves from (4,9) to (3,9)

Body becomes:

Body1: (2,9)
Body2: (3,9)

Head at (1,9), body cells [(2,9), (3,9)] → no collision.

Next move LEFT to (0,9):

- Head moves from (1,9) to (0,9)
- Body1 moves from (2,9) to (1,9)
- Body2 moves from (3,9) to (2,9)

Body becomes:

Body1: (1,9)
Body2: (2,9)

Head at (0,9), body cells [(1,9), (2,9)] → no collision.

Thus, the snake successfully reaches (0,9) without self-intersecting.

So the sequence of moves is seven UPs and four LEFTs, totaling 11 moves.

But wait, let me recount:

From (4,2):

1. UP to (4,3)
2. UP to (4,4)
3. UP to (4,5)
4. UP to (4,6)
5. UP to (4,7)
6. UP to (4,8)
7. UP to (4,9) → 7 moves
Then:
8. LEFT to (3,9)
9. LEFT to (2,9)
10.LEFT to (1,9)
11.LEFT to (0,9)

Yes, 11 moves in total.

So the answer is \boxed{11}
</think>

The snake starts at position (4, 2) and needs to reach position (0, 9). The snake can move up or left. Each move adds a new head segment and removes the tail segment, keeping the length constant.

1. Move UP from (4, 2) to (4, 3).
2. Move UP from (4, 3) to (4, 4).
3. Move UP from (4, 4) to (4, 5).
4. Move UP from (4, 5) to (4, 6).
5. Move UP from (4, 6) to (4, 7).
6. Move UP from (4, 7) to (4, 8).
7. Move UP from (4, 8) to (4, 9).

After these seven UP moves, the snake reaches (4, 9). Next, it needs to move LEFT four times:

8. Move LEFT from (4, 9) to (3, 9).
9. Move LEFT from (3, 9) to (2, 9).
10. Move LEFT from (2, 9) to (1, 9).
11. Move LEFT from (1, 9) to (0, 9).

Thus, the snake successfully reaches position (0, 9) in a total of 11 moves.

The final answer is \boxed{11}.
