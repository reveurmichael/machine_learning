========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the solution for this Snake problem.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake and its environment. The snake's head is at (0,3), which is on the bottom-left side near the center vertically. The body segments are [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)], so the snake is extending to the right from (0,2) to (2,2). The current direction is "UP", meaning the next move without any change would be towards increasing y-values.

The apple is at (1,7), which is near the top-right of the grid. To reach there from (0,3), the snake needs to move right once and up four times. But since the snake can't reverse direction immediately, I need to consider how to maneuver without causing collisions.

I start by checking possible moves from the current position. Since the direction is "UP", the next move can be any except "DOWN". The valid options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Moving UP would take the head to (0,4), which seems safe as it's not colliding with body segments or walls. Moving LEFT isn't possible because x=0 is the boundary. So, moving RIGHT or UP becomes the initial choices.

Choosing RIGHT first makes sense because it starts the snake on a path towards the apple's x-coordinate. However, I need to ensure that this move doesn't lead into any future collisions with the body segments as they shift. Since the body is currently extending downward from (0,2) to (2,2), moving right will change the direction towards the apple without immediate collision.

After moving RIGHT, the head is at (1,3). From here, I can consider moving UP repeatedly to reach y=7. However, each move needs to be checked for collisions with the body segments and ensure that after eating the apple, there's still a way out.

I realize that moving UP four times from (1,3) would take the head to (1,7), which is exactly where the apple is. But I need to make sure that when the snake eats the apple, it doesn't trap itself. This means ensuring that after eating, there's still space for the body to move without blocking the next moves.

Additionally, considering the movement rules, each move should not reverse the direction. So, from UP, we can't go DOWN unless necessary. But since moving RIGHT first breaks away from the current body path, it sets a new trajectory towards the apple.

I also think about the body's growth when eating the apple. By growing, the tail doesn't move, which might leave some space behind to avoid getting stuck. This is crucial because after eating, the snake must have at least one legal move left.

Overall, the plan is to move RIGHT first to start progressing towards the apple's x-coordinate and then proceed UP as much as possible without causing collisions with the body segments.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves right to (1,3), then up four times to reach the apple at (1,7). This path avoids immediate collisions and ensures a safe progression towards the target."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 3) and whose body cells are in list format [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (1, 7). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
