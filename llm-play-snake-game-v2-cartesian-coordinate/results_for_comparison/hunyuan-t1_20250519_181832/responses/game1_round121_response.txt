  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move right 6 times to align with the apple's x-coordinate (7) and then down 2 times to reach the apple's y-coordinate (7). The initial direction is UP, so the first move cannot be DOWN. The path avoids collisions with the body and walls, ensuring all new head positions are safe."
