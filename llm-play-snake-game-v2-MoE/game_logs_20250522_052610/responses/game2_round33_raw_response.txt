========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake eat the apple without dying. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the current state of the game. The snake's head is at (1,4), and it's currently moving LEFT. The body cells are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], which means the snake is a straight line from (5,3) up to (2,4). Wait, that doesn't seem right because if the head is at (1,4), the body should be trailing behind. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the body cells list. It's given as [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], but since the head is at (1,4), perhaps there's a typo or miscalculation here. Hmm, that might be an issue because if the body cells include (2,4) and the head is at (1,4), moving left would take it to (0,4), which might collide with its own body.

Wait, no, the snake can't reverse direction immediately. The current direction is LEFT, so the next move can't be RIGHT because that's reversing. But according to rule 3, you cannot reverse direction. So if the snake is moving LEFT, the next move can't be RIGHT, but it can be UP or DOWN.

The apple is at (8,9), which is far away from the head's current position of (1,4). The Manhattan distance between them is |8-1| + |9-4| = 7 +5=12. So we need a path that covers this distance without causing collision or moving out of bounds.

Let's visualize the grid. The snake is on a 10x10 grid, with (0,0) at the bottom-left and (9,9) at the top-right. The apple is at the top-right corner. The head is near the left side, middle row.

The body cells are given as [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because if the snake's head is at (1,4) and moving LEFT, then the body should be trailing to the right. So perhaps the body cells list is in reverse order? Because when the snake moves, each segment follows the previous one.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body cells are ordered. The body cells list probably starts from the last part of the body (the tail) up to just before the head. So if the head is at (1,4), and it's moving LEFT, the previous positions would be to the right. But looking at the body cells [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], that seems like a line going from x=5 down to x=2 in y=4 and then one cell at y=3. That might mean the snake is not moving straight but perhaps making some turns earlier.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: The head is at (1,4), direction is LEFT, so the previous position before that would have been (2,4). Then the body would be [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], which suggests that after moving from (2,4) to (1,4), the tail is at (5,3). That seems a bit far. So the snake's body is spread out from (2,4) down to (5,3). Wait, but the movement direction is LEFT, so each new head position adds a segment to the left.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the snake moves. Each step, the head moves in the current direction, and then the tail follows unless the apple is eaten. So if the current direction is LEFT, the next move must be either UP or DOWN, but not RIGHT (since that's reversing).

So starting at (1,4), moving LEFT would take the head to (0,4). But wait, looking at the body cells, the last segment before the head is (2,4). So if the head moves LEFT to (0,4), the next body cell becomes (1,4), then (2,4), etc. But I need to make sure that when moving, the new head position doesn't collide with any of the body cells.

So first, let's consider possible directions. Since current direction is LEFT, the next move can be UP or DOWN, not RIGHT. So from (1,4), moving UP would take it to (1,5), and moving DOWN to (1,3). Both are valid as long as they don't collide with body cells.

Looking at the body cells: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]. So when the head is at (1,4) and moving LEFT, the next position after moving would be either (0,4) if moving further left, but that's not allowed because direction can't reverse. Wait no: wait, current direction is LEFT, so next move can't be RIGHT, but UP or DOWN are allowed.

Wait, no: rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. So from LEFT, you can't go to RIGHT. But you can go to UP or DOWN. So the first move after LEFT must be either UP or DOWN.

So starting at (1,4), if we choose to move DOWN first, that would take us to (1,3). Let's see: is (1,3) safe? Looking at body cells, none of them are at (1,3), so it's safe. Then the next moves need to get us towards the apple.

Alternatively, moving UP from (1,4) takes us to (1,5). Let's check if that's safe. The body cells are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], so no collision there either.

But which direction is better? Let's think about the path towards the apple at (8,9). We need to move right 7 times and up 5 times. So a total of 12 moves, but considering that some steps might be blocked by the body or walls.

Wait, but the initial position after moving from LEFT can't go further left because it's already on x=1, so next step should be either UP or DOWN.

Let me try to plan a path:

Option 1: Move DOWN first to (1,3), then start moving RIGHT towards the apple. But wait, if we move DOWN, the body cells will shift, and perhaps that could block some paths.

Alternatively, Option 2: Move UP to (1,5), then start moving RIGHT and then up further.

But let's think about the required moves: from x=1 to x=8 is +7 in x-direction, so we need 7 more RIGHT moves than LEFT. From y=4 to y=9 is +5, so 5 more UP moves than DOWN.

So the path must have a net of 7 RIGHT and 5 UP moves.

But since the current direction is LEFT, the first move can't be RIGHT. So the first move has to be either UP or DOWN. Let's say we choose to go UP first to (1,5).

Now, after moving UP, the head is at (1,5), and the body cells would have shifted: the previous head (1,4) becomes part of the body, so the new body cells are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)].

Then, next move can't be DOWN because that would reverse direction from UP. Wait no: rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction, but if the current direction is NONE after moving, then any direction is allowed.

Wait, no: when you make a move, the new direction becomes the one you moved to. So if you're currently going LEFT and you move UP, your new direction is UP, so next moves can't be DOWN unless it's safe.

But wait, rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction. So moving from UP to DOWN would be reversing, which is not allowed. Similarly, moving from LEFT to RIGHT is reversing.

So if the current direction is LEFT and we move UP, then the new direction is UP. The next moves can't be DOWN unless it's allowed by not reversing.

Wait, no: rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction on the next step. So after moving UP, your current direction is UP, so the next move cannot be DOWN. Similarly, if you were going RIGHT and then LEFT, that would be reversing and thus invalid.

So in our case, after moving UP from (1,4) to (1,5), the new direction is UP, so the next move can't be DOWN.

But wait, no: rule 3 says you cannot reverse on the next step. So if current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT. If after moving UP, the direction becomes UP, then the next move can't be DOWN (reversing from UP to DOWN). So when in UP, next move can't be DOWN.

So let's proceed:

1. Move UP to (1,5) – direction is now UP.
2. Next move can't be DOWN; options are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

But we need to get towards the apple at (8,9), so moving RIGHT would help us gain x-coordinate.

But wait, from (1,5), moving RIGHT would take us to (2,5). But let's check if that's safe. The body cells after first move are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]. So (2,5) is not part of the body yet.

But wait, when we move from (1,4) to (1,5), the new head is at (1,5), and the previous positions become part of the body. The tail remains unless we eat an apple. Since we haven't eaten the apple yet, the tail would have moved: the last body cell was (2,4), so after moving UP, the tail becomes (5,3) → (5,4) → ... → (1,4). So the new body cells are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)], and the head is at (1,5).

So moving RIGHT from (1,5) to (2,5) is safe. Now direction is RIGHT.

Next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse direction (from RIGHT to LEFT). So next moves have to be UP or DOWN or RIGHT.

But we need to continue towards the apple, which is at x=8, so moving right as much as possible makes sense.

So from (2,5), let's keep moving RIGHT:

3. Move RIGHT to (3,5)
4. Move RIGHT to (4,5)
5. Move RIGHT to (5,5)
6. Move RIGHT to (6,5)
7. Move RIGHT to (7,5)
8. Move RIGHT to (8,5)

Now at (8,5), we need to move up to reach y=9.

But let's check if moving up is possible without collision.

After step 8, the body would have extended all the way from (1,4) up to (8,5). The body cells after each move are as follows:

Wait, but each time we move RIGHT, the tail moves forward because the apple hasn't been eaten yet. So after moving from (7,5) to (8,5), the tail would have moved from (2,4) → ... → (8,5)? Wait no, that's not right. Each step, the snake moves one cell, and unless it eats an apple, the tail is removed. Since we haven't eaten the apple yet, each move reduces the length by removing the tail.

Wait, but in this case, after moving from (1,4) to (1,5), the tail would have been at (2,4) and moves forward as well? Wait no: the body cells are a list of all the segments except the head. So when you move, each segment follows the previous one.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The snake's body is represented by the body_cells list. Each time the snake moves, the new head is added to the front, and if not eating an apple, the last element (tail) is removed.

So initial body_cells are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]. The head is at (1,4). So after moving UP to (1,5), the new body becomes [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)], and the head is at (1,5).

Then, when moving RIGHT to (2,5), the new head is at (2,5), and the body becomes [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)], but since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (5,3) is removed. So new body_cells are [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)].

Wait no: wait, each move adds a new head and removes the tail unless an apple is eaten. So initial length after the first move would be 6 cells? Wait, let me clarify:

- Initial body_cells have 5 cells.
- Head is at (1,4).
After moving UP to (1,5), new head is added: body becomes [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] and the head is now (1,5). But since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (5,3) is removed. So new body_cells are [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ], and the head is (1,5).

Then moving RIGHT to (2,5): new head is (2,5). Body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] but remove tail (5,4) because no apple eaten. So body_cells are [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ].

Wait this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think that each move adds the new head and removes the tail, keeping the length same unless apple is eaten.

But perhaps I should instead plan a path that avoids collision with body cells.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first would be better.

Let me try Option 1 again: Start by moving DOWN from (1,4) to (1,3).

So step 1: Move DOWN to (1,3). Direction is now DOWN.

Now, check if this is safe. Body_cells after movement are [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], and the new head is at (1,3). Since no apple eaten, tail (5,3) is removed, so body_cells become [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,3) ].

Now, next move can't be UP because that would reverse direction from DOWN to UP. So options are LEFT or RIGHT or DOWN.

But we need to get towards the apple at x=8, y=9. So moving RIGHT is better.

Step 2: Move RIGHT to (2,3). Check safety: body_cells after step1 are [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,3) ]. So (2,3) is not part of the body. Safe.

Now direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT.

Step 3: Move RIGHT to (3,3)
Step 4: Move RIGHT to (4,3)
Step5: Move RIGHT to (5,3)
But wait, after step1, the body cells are [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,3) ], so moving to (5,3) is not part of the body yet.

Wait no: when you move to (5,3), the new head is at (5,3). But after step4, where are the body cells?

Let me track:

After step2: head at (2,3), body_cells [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,3) ]

Wait no: when you move from (1,3) to (2,3), the new head is added, and tail removed.

So initial after step1: body_cells are [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,3) ] with head at (1,3).

Moving RIGHT to (2,3): new head is (2,3). Body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,3), (2,3) ] but since no apple, remove tail (5,4). So body_cells after step2: [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,3), (2,3) ]

Step3: move to (3,3). New head at (3,3). Body becomes [ ... ] but let's not get bogged down.

But moving towards x=8 from (5,3) is still a long way. Also, the body may start blocking us as we proceed.

Alternatively, maybe after moving DOWN and then RIGHT for a few steps, we can switch to UP direction when possible.

Wait, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe a better strategy is needed.

Another idea: Since we need to make 7 right moves and 5 up moves, let's try to move as much as possible towards the apple without getting blocked by the body.

But considering that after each move, the body shifts, it's hard to plan all steps in advance. Maybe a depth-first search or BFS approach would be better, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can find a path.

Wait, maybe instead of moving DOWN first, let me try moving UP first and see if that leads to a collision.

So initial step: move UP from (1,4) to (1,5). Direction is now UP. Body_cells after this are [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] with head at (1,5). Tail (5,3) removed? Wait no: when you move, the new head is added and tail is removed if not eating apple.

So after moving UP from (1,4) to (1,5), body_cells become [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] because the tail (5,3) is removed.

Next move can't be DOWN. So options: LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

But we need to reach x=8, so moving RIGHT would help.

Step 2: Move RIGHT from (1,5) to (2,5). Check safety: body_cells are [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ]. So (2,5) is safe. Direction now is RIGHT.

Next move can't be LEFT.

Step 3: Move RIGHT to (3,5)
Step4: Move RIGHT to (4,5)
Step5: Move RIGHT to (5,5)
Step6: Move RIGHT to (6,5)
Step7: Move RIGHT to (7,5)
Step8: Move RIGHT to (8,5)

Now at (8,5), need to move up 4 more times to reach y=9. But let's check if that's possible without collision.

After each step towards the right, body_cells are shifting. For example:

After moving from (7,5) to (8,5):

- New head is at (8,5).
- Body becomes [ ... , (7,5) ] but tail would have been removed, so previous body cells before this move were [ ... ].

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me assume that moving right up to x=8 is safe and then focus on moving up.

So after step8 at (8,5), next steps:

Step9: Move UP to (8,6)
Step10: Move UP to (8,7)
Step11: Move UP to (8,8)
Step12: Move UP to (8,9)

But wait, each time we move UP, the direction changes, so after moving UP from (8,5) to (8,6), the new direction is UP. Then next moves can't be DOWN.

So steps:

9. UP to (8,6)
10. UP to (8,7)
11. UP to (8,8)
12. UP to (8,9)

Now, at step12, we've reached the apple at (8,9). But wait, in this case, have we eaten the apple? Because if yes, the tail doesn't get removed, so body length increases.

But actually, in this scenario, we were just moving towards it without considering eating yet. So perhaps I need to adjust when we eat the apple.

Wait, no: the problem is about reaching the apple's position; whether it's eaten or not may not matter here. But for the sake of the movement, we just need to reach (8,9) without collision.

But let's check if any of these steps cause collision with body cells.

After step8 at (8,5), body_cells are [ ... ] but I think by then, the body has shifted so much that it's not blocking the path upwards. Let me try to simulate:

After moving up from (8,5) to (8,6):

- New head is at (8,6).
- Body becomes previous positions: [ ..., (8,5), ... ] but tail removed.

But I'm getting stuck on tracking body cells.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is needed. Let me try another strategy: moving UP first, then RIGHT, and then up as much as possible.

Wait, maybe I should consider that after moving UP to (1,5) and then moving right towards x=8, the path upwards might be blocked by the body. So perhaps moving in a different direction initially would help.

Alternatively, maybe it's impossible to reach (8,9) without being blocked, but I think with careful planning, it should be possible.

Wait, another idea: After moving UP to (1,5), move RIGHT until x=8, then move UP. Let me check:

Step1: Move UP from (1,4) to (1,5)
Step2: RIGHT to (2,5)
Step3: RIGHT to (3,5)
...
Step7: RIGHT to (8,5)
Then step8: UP to (8,6)
...
Step12: UP to (8,9)

But let's check for collisions:

After moving to (8,5), body_cells would have shifted so that the tail is at (something). Let me see after each move:

- After step1: head (1,5), body [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ]
- After step2: head (2,5), body [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (2,5) ]? Wait no, when moving right, the tail is removed. So after step2, body_cells would be [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (2,5) ], but I'm not sure.

This manual tracking is too time-consuming. Maybe instead, think about it as a grid and find the shortest path avoiding obstacles (body cells). But perhaps the answer is that it's possible in 13 moves: 7 rights and 6 ups? Or maybe 12 moves.

Alternatively, considering that each move changes direction, but the exact number might not be critical. Perhaps the minimal number of moves is 13, but I'm not sure.

But let me think differently: from (1,4), need to reach (8,9). The minimal path without obstacles would be moving right 7 times and up 5 times, total 12 moves. But with obstacles (body cells), it might take more steps, possibly 13.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that it's possible in 14 moves: considering the initial movement DOWN or UP and then adjusting.

But I'm not sure about the exact number. Given that, perhaps the minimal number of moves required is 7 right + 5 up = 12, but with obstacles, possibly 13 or more.

Wait, no—each move can only be one step in a direction, so total steps would be at least 12, but could be more due to detours. But I think the answer expects us to find that it's possible and determine the minimal number of moves, which would be 7 + 5 = 12, assuming no obstacles block the way.

But in reality, because of the body cells moving, it might not be possible to take a straight path. So perhaps more steps are needed.

Wait, but maybe I can find a specific path. Let me try:

Start at (1,4).

Move UP to (1,5)
Then RIGHT x7 to reach (8,5)
Then UP x4 to reach (8,9)

Total moves: 1 +7 +4 = 12.

But during this, the body cells may block. Let me check:

After moving up to (1,5), body_cells are [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ] with head at (1,5). Then tail (5,3) is removed, so body becomes [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,5) ]

Wait no: when you move from (1,4) to (1,5), the new head is added at (1,5), and tail (5,3) is removed. So body_cells after step1 are [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,5) ].

Then moving right to (2,5): add new head, remove tail (5,4). So body becomes [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]

Continue moving right:

Step3: (3,5) → body becomes [ (3,4), (2,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) ]
...
After step7 at (8,5): body_cells are [ (something), ... , (7,5), (8,5) ]

Then move up:

Step9: (8,6). Now check if any body cells are at (8,6). Previous body after step7 was [..., (8,5)]. So when moving up to (8,6), it's a new cell. Continue:

Step10: (8,7)
Step11: (8,8)
Step12: (8,9)

So total steps: 12.

But wait, after each move right, the body cells are shifting and possibly blocking. But in this case, moving right to x=8 doesn't seem to be blocked because the body is behind us. Once we're at x=8, y=5, moving up shouldn't be blocked by previous positions since they are lower y's.

Thus, it seems possible in 12 moves.
</think>

The minimal number of moves required to reach (8,9) from (1,4) without collision is 12. 

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Move UP from (1,4) to (1,5).
2. Move RIGHT six times to reach (7,5), then move RIGHT once more to (8,5). This takes a total of seven RIGHT moves.
3. Finally, move UP four times to reach (8,9).

This totals 1 (UP) + 7 (RIGHTS) + 4 (UPS) = 12 moves.

Answer: The snake can reach the apple in \boxed{12} moves.
