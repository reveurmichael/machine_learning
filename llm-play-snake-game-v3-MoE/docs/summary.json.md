## Question


As a fundamental rule, the schema of our `game_N.json` and `summary.json` files is now fixed and should never be modified. You can, on the contrary, modify the code to change how those values are calculated.


What is the summary.json file , what's the detailed schema? Is its entries ordered? What is toward the top and toward the bottom of the json file? What's the relationship between the entries? Write a long long long answer in ./docs/summary.json.md
