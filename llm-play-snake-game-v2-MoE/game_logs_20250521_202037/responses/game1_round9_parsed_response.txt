{"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake starts by moving RIGHT once, then moves DOWN seven times towards the y-coordinate 0. After each DOWN move, it continues moving RIGHT until reaching x=6. This ensures that we adhere to the constraint of not reversing direction immediately after any move while systematically moving right and then down to reach the target position."}
