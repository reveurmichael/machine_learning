========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,7) with direction LEFT. First, move DOWN to (0,6) to avoid the left wall and align towards the apple. Then move RIGHT twice to reach (2,6), aligning horizontally with the apple. Finally, move DOWN to (2,5) to eat the apple. This path avoids body collisions, stays in bounds, and ensures a safe move after eating."
