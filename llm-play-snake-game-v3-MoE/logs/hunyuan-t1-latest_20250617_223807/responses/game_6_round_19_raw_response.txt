{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 5 left (from x=7 to x=2) and 3 down (from y=8 to y=5). Starting with direction UP, the first valid moves are LEFT to avoid reversing. Moving left 5 times brings the head to (2,8). Then moving down 3 times reaches the apple at (2,5). Each step avoids body collisions, and after eating the apple, there are legal moves (e.g., left or right) to avoid trapping."
