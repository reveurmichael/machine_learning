You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, let's see. The snake's head is at (2,4), and the apple is at (1,4). The current direction is UP, and the body is [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]. So the body is a straight line from (2,3) to (6,3). The head is at (2,4), which is directly above (2,3). So the snake is facing up, and the body is to the south of the head.

First, the apple is to the left of the head. The head is at x=2, apple at x=1, same y. So the snake needs to move left. But wait, the current direction is UP. So the first move can't be DOWN (reverse), but LEFT is allowed.

Let me think about possible moves. The head is at (2,4). If I move LEFT, the new head would be (1,4), which is the apple's position. That's great. But I need to check for collisions.

Wait, the movement rules say that when moving, the new head must not collide with any body segments except the tail when it's about to move. Let's check: the current body segments are [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]. The new head would be (1,4). None of the body segments are at (1,4), so that's safe. Also, the new head is within the grid (x=1, y=4 is valid). So moving left directly to the apple would work.

But wait, after moving left, the snake would eat the apple. So the body would grow. Let's simulate that.

Original head is (2,4), body is [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]. If we move LEFT, new head is (1,4). Then, since the new head is the apple's position, the body is updated by inserting the old head (2,4) at the front. So the new body becomes [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)], and since we ate the apple, we don't remove the tail. So the body length increases by 1.

After that, the snake's head is (1,4), and the body is as above. Now, the next move needs to be valid. But since the problem only requires reaching the apple, and the moves are to get to the apple, maybe the answer is just one move: LEFT.

But let me check if moving left is allowed. The current direction is UP, so moving LEFT is allowed (no reversal). Also, the new head (1,4) is not in the body except the tail's current cell. Wait, the tail is at (6,3), which is not (1,4). So no collision. Therefore, moving left directly is safe and reaches the apple.

So the moves would be ["LEFT"], and the reasoning is that moving left directly to the apple is possible without collision.
</think>

{
"moves": ["LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The apple is directly to the left of the head at (1,4). Moving left immediately reaches the apple without collision, as the new head position is unoccupied and within bounds."
}
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (2, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [(6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3)], to eat the apple at (1, 4).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
