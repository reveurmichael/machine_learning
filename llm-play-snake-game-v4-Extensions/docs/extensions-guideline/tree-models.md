# Tree-Based Models for Snake Game AI

> **Important ‚Äî Authoritative Reference:** This document supplements the _Final Decision Series_ and extension guidelines. Tree-based models follow the same architectural patterns as other supervised learning approaches.

## üå≥ **Tree Models Philosophy**

Tree-based models excel at learning decision patterns from tabular data, making them ideal for Snake Game AI where game states can be represented as structured feature vectors. They bridge the gap between interpretable heuristics and powerful neural networks.

### **Core Advantages**
- **Interpretability**: Decision paths provide clear reasoning insights
- **Robustness**: Handle mixed data types and missing values gracefully
- **Feature Importance**: Built-in analysis of decision-making factors
- **Performance**: Often competitive with neural networks on tabular data

## üß† **Tree Model Portfolio**

### **Ensemble Methods**
- **Random Forest**: Robust baseline with excellent generalization
- **Extra Trees**: Faster training with additional randomization
- **Voting Classifiers**: Combining multiple tree-based approaches

### **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**: High-performance gradient boosting with advanced features
- **LightGBM**: Memory-efficient with fast training capabilities
- **CatBoost**: Categorical feature handling with robust hyperparameters

### **Single Trees**
- **Decision Trees**: Educational foundation for understanding tree logic
- **CART**: Classification and regression trees for baseline comparison

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Integration**

### **Following GOODFILES Patterns**
Tree models integrate with established supervised learning architecture:

**Agent Naming (Final Decision 4)**:
```python
agent_xgboost.py       ‚Üí class XGBoostAgent(BaseAgent)
agent_lightgbm.py      ‚Üí class LightGBMAgent(BaseAgent)
agent_randomforest.py  ‚Üí class RandomForestAgent(BaseAgent)
```

**Factory Pattern Integration**:
```python
class TreeModelFactory:
    """Factory for creating tree-based model agents"""
    
    _model_registry = {
        "XGBOOST": XGBoostAgent,
        "LIGHTGBM": LightGBMAgent,
        "RANDOMFOREST": RandomForestAgent,
        "CATBOOST": CatBoostAgent,
    }
    
    @classmethod
    def create_agent(cls, model_type: str, **kwargs):
        """Create tree model agent by type"""
        return cls._model_registry[model_type.upper()](**kwargs)
```

**Extension Structure Integration**:
```python
# Following supervised-v0.02+ structure
extensions/supervised-v0.02/

```

## üöÄ **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Tree Model State Representation**
Tree-based models work optimally with the **16-feature tabular representation**:

| Representation Type | Tree Model Compatibility | Performance |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **16-Feature Tabular (CSV)** | ‚úÖ **Perfect match** | Optimal - native format |
| **Sequential NPZ** | ‚ùå Poor fit | Trees don't handle sequences well |
| **Spatial 2D Arrays** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires flattening | Loses spatial structure benefits |
| **Graph Structures** | ‚ùå Incompatible | Trees need tabular input |
| **Raw Board State** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Too high-dimensional | Feature explosion problem |

**Why 16-Feature Schema is Perfect for Trees:**
- **Engineered Features**: Pre-processed meaningful attributes
- **Fixed Dimensionality**: Consistent input size across all games
- **Interpretable Features**: Clear mapping to game state concepts
- **Optimal Performance**: Designed specifically for tree-based learning

**Tree-Specific Advantages:**
- **No Preprocessing**: CSV can be used directly without scaling
- **Feature Importance**: Built-in analysis of which features matter most
- **Fast Training**: Tabular data enables efficient tree construction
- **Interpretability**: Decision paths directly reference meaningful features

### **Data Pipeline Integration**
Tree models consume the standardized CSV schema from csv-schema-1.md:
```python
from extensions.common.csv_schema import TabularFeatureExtractor
from extensions.common.dataset_loader import load_dataset_for_training

# Load dataset for tree training
X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test, info = load_dataset_for_training(
    dataset_paths=dataset_paths,
    grid_size=grid_size,
    scale_features=False  # Tree models don't require feature scaling
)
```

### **Configuration Management**
Following Final Decision 2:
```python
from extensions.common.config.ml_constants import (
    DEFAULT_TREE_DEPTH,
    DEFAULT_N_ESTIMATORS,
    DEFAULT_LEARNING_RATE,
    TREE_VALIDATION_SPLIT
)
```

### **Base Agent Integration**
Tree models extend the supervised learning agent hierarchy:
```python
class TreeAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Base class for tree-based model agents"""
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, grid_size: int):
        super().__init__(name, grid_size)
        self.model = None
        self.feature_importance = None
    
    @abstractmethod
    def train(self, X_train, y_train, X_val=None, y_val=None):
        """Train tree model on provided data"""
        pass
    
    def get_feature_importance(self):
        """Return feature importance scores"""
        if self.model and hasattr(self.model, 'feature_importances_'):
            return self.model.feature_importances_
        return None
```

        )
    
    def train(self, X_train, y_train, X_val=None, y_val=None):
        """Train XGBoost with early stopping if validation data provided"""
        if X_val is not None:
            self.model.fit(
                X_train, y_train,
                eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],
                early_stopping_rounds=10,
                verbose=False
            )
        else:
            self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### **LightGBM Integration**
```python
class LightGBMAgent(TreeAgent):
    """LightGBM implementation optimized for large datasets"""
    
    def train(self, X_train, y_train, X_val=None, y_val=None):
        """Train LightGBM with categorical feature handling"""
        self.model.fit(
            X_train, y_train,
            eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)] if X_val is not None else None,
            categorical_feature='auto',
            early_stopping_rounds=10
