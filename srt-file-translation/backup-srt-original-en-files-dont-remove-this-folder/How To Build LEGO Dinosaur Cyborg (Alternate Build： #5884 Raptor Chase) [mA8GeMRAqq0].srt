00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
5884 raptor chase but if you don't have
 

35
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,029
5884 raptor chase but if you don't have
that set here's a look at the pieces i'm

36
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
that set here's a look at the pieces i'm
 

37
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,549
that set here's a look at the pieces i'm
using so you can go find them in your

00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
using so you can go find them in your
 

39
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,549
using so you can go find them in your
own collection

own collection
 

41
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,229
own collection
so the colors i'm using here are

42
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
so the colors i'm using here are
 

43
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,910
so the colors i'm using here are
determined all by what's in the set but

00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
layering on top of that we're going to
 

63
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,789
layering on top of that we're going to
take one of these 1 by 6 curvy slopes in

64
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
take one of these 1 by 6 curvy slopes in

bring that together

68
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
bring that together
 

69
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,670
bring that together
a 1 by 3 downward regular slope

70
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
a 1 by 3 downward regular slope
 

71
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,510
a 1 by 3 downward regular slope
bring that together

2 by 2 plate
 

77
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,469
2 by 2 plate
and then this dinosaur leg

78
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
and then this dinosaur leg
 

79
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,149
and then this dinosaur leg
right on top

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
right on top
 

81
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,910
right on top
and now you'll need the same pieces but

82
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
and now you'll need the same pieces but
 

83
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,590
and now you'll need the same pieces but
with a dinosaur leg going the other

84
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
with a dinosaur leg going the other
 

85
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,590

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
direction
 

87
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,749
direction
so this side is gonna be just the mirror

88
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
so this side is gonna be just the mirror
 

89
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,429
so this side is gonna be just the mirror
of the other side so start again with a

in the set
 

135
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,830
in the set
then we're going to use a 2x4 tile in

136
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
then we're going to use a 2x4 tile in

happens to be one of the bumpy ones
 

145
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,070
happens to be one of the bumpy ones
do another one of those and then i'm

146
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
do another one of those and then i'm
 

147
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,710
do another one of those and then i'm
going to use this uh 2x2 upward slope in

148
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
going to use this uh 2x2 upward slope in
 

149
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,149
going to use this uh 2x2 upward slope in
dark gray so that's what was in the set

150

on that so that's the waste piece

154
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
on that so that's the waste piece
 

155
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,110
on that so that's the waste piece
so to bring that all together we're

156
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
so to bring that all together we're
 

157
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,589
so to bring that all together we're
going to take the waist piece like so

158
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
going to take the waist piece like so
 

159
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,030
going to take the waist piece like so
and then connect each leg

160
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
