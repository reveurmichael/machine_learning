========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll analyze the current situation to determine the best path for the snake's head to reach the apple at (1, 6) from its current position at (7, 7).

Let's break down the requirements:
- Current Head Position: (7, 7)
- Apple Position: (1, 6)
- Body Positions: [(7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)]
- Current Direction: UP

We need to move from (7, 7) to (1, 6). Let's calculate the required moves:

### Calculations
1. Move LEFT from x=7 to x=1:
   - We need 6 LEFT moves (since 7 - 1 = 6).

2. Move DOWN from y=7 to y=6:
   - We need 1 DOWN move (since 7 - 6 = 1).

### Planning the Moves
We'll plan the sequence of moves, ensuring we avoid any collisions with the body and maintain the constraints:

Since the snake is initially moving UP, it cannot reverse direction immediately. Hence, our first few moves should be LEFT or RIGHT to change the x-coordinate until we can safely go DOWN.

Let's construct the path step by step:
1. Move LEFT 6 times: (7, 7) → (6, 7) → ... → (1, 7)
2. Move DOWN once: (1, 7) → (1, 6)

### Final Path
This results in the following sequence of moves:

```
LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN
```

### Reasoning
The snake needs to move left six times and down once to reach the apple position at (1, 6). This path avoids collisions with walls and its body.

Let's construct the JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move LEFT six times to adjust x-coordinate from 7 to 1, then DOWN once to adjust y-coordinate from 7 to 6."
}
```

This is the valid JSON object output following the required format.
