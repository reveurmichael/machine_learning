<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem where the snake needs to move from its head position at (7,2) to eat an apple at (2,5). Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the initial state of the snake. The head is at (7,2), and the body cells are [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)]. So, the snake is currently positioned vertically along the x=7 column, starting from (7,2) as the head down to (7,6) as the tail. That means the snake's body is in a straight line going downward.

The current direction is "DOWN", which means the snake was moving downwards before any moves. However, I need to ensure that on each move, the snake doesn't reverse its direction suddenly unless it's allowed. Since the initial direction is "DOWN", the next move can't be "UP". The possible directions are "DOWN", "LEFT", or "RIGHT" because reversing from DOWN isn't allowed yet.

Now, my goal is to plan a path for the head to reach (2,5). Let me calculate the Manhattan distance between the head and the apple. From (7,2) to (2,5), the x-distance is 5 units left, and the y-distance is 3 units up. So, a direct path would require moving left and then up. However, I need to be cautious about the snake's body segments and avoid collisions.

Looking at the initial positions, the snake's body is blocking the immediate cells below the head. The tail is at (7,6), so the next move can't go further down without causing a collision. Therefore, the snake must turn either left or right to avoid reversing direction immediately.

If I choose "LEFT" as the first move, the new head will be at (6,2). This keeps the snake moving in a new direction without reversing. Then, from (6,2), I can continue moving left to get closer to the apple's x-coordinate of 2. Each move to the left reduces the x-coordinate by 1.

Once the snake's head is at (3,2), moving up would be beneficial because it aligns with the y-coordinate of the apple at 5. So, from (3,2), moving "UP" would take the head to (3,3), then to (3,4), and so on until reaching (3,5). This approach should bring the snake's head closer to the apple while avoiding collisions with its own body.

I also need to check if at any point the new head position collides with the body segments. Since the body is moving forward as well, I have to consider that each segment will shift after the head moves. However, since the snake is growing when it eats the apple, the tail won't move, which can affect the path.

Another consideration is ensuring that after eating the apple, there's at least one legal move available. If the snake gets trapped immediately after eating, it would die, so I must plan a path where the snake can continue moving even after eating the apple.

Let me outline the possible moves step by step:

1. Initial position: (7,2), direction "DOWN".
2. Move "LEFT" to (6,2).
3. Continue moving "LEFT" until x=2 is reached at (2,2).
4. Then start moving "UP" towards y=5.
5. Each move must be checked for collisions and ensure the body segments don't block the path.

I should also consider that after each move, the snake's body shifts forward. So, if I move left multiple times, the tail will eventually move up as well, which might create a situation where the head can't proceed further without colliding with the body.

Another approach is to plan a path that goes around the apple, perhaps moving up before going left to avoid any potential blockages. For example:

1. Move "LEFT" to (6,2).
2. Then move "UP" multiple times to get higher y-coordinates.
3. Once at an appropriate x and y position, start moving towards (2,5).

But this might take more moves and could increase the risk of collision or reversal. Since Manhattan distance is a heuristic, I should prioritize safety over speed.

I think the initial approach of moving left first to (6,2) and then up seems safer. Let me simulate this path:

- Move 1: "LEFT" to (6,2).
- Now direction can't be reversed; next move can't be "UP".
Wait, no, after moving left, the current direction is "LEFT", so reversing would mean changing to "RIGHT". So, in the next move, I can still choose to continue left or change direction.

But wait, initially, the direction was "DOWN", and the first move is "LEFT", which isn't a reverse. Then, subsequent moves can be either "LEFT" or "DOWN" again if allowed. However, moving down would take the snake back towards its original position, which might not be efficient but could be necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps moving left all the way to (2,2) and then up is better because it gets the head closer to the apple both in x and y directions.

Let me simulate this:

1. Move 1: "LEFT" from (7,2) to (6,2).
   - New head: (6,2), direction: "LEFT".
   - Check for collisions: No body segments are at (6,2) except the new head.
   - Since not eating apple, tail moves: remove last body cell (7,6) becomes (7,5)? Wait, no—the initial body cells are [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)]. After moving left, the old head (7,2) is inserted at the front of the body list. Then, since not eating apple, the tail (7,6) is removed.

Wait, no: when you move normally, after inserting the old head into the body, the tail moves forward by one cell. So, if the snake doesn't eat the apple, the body length remains the same, and the tail moves up by one row.

So after moving left to (6,2):

- New head: (6,2).
- Body becomes [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)].
- Tail was at (7,6), which is now removed. So the new body is [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)], and tail is at (7,5).

Next move: can I continue moving left?

Yes, because direction is "LEFT", so next move could be another left.

Move 2: "LEFT" to (5,2).
- New head: (5,2).
- Check for collisions: No body segments there.
- Body becomes [(6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)]? Wait, no. After moving, the old head (6,2) is inserted at the front of the body list. So body after move 1 was [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)]. Then, moving left to (5,2):

- Insert (6,2) at front: body becomes [(6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)].
- Since not eating apple, remove tail: (7,5) is removed. So new body is [(6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)], and tail is at (7,4).

Wait, this seems confusing. Maybe I should think about the movement process again.

Each move:

1. Compute new head.
2. Check collision with boundaries or other body cells (excluding future moves).
3. If safe:
   a. Insert old head into body list as BODY1.
   b. If new_head is apple, grow (don't remove tail).
   c. Else, remove last element of body (tail).
4. Update head to new_head.

So after move 1: "LEFT" from (7,2) to (6,2):

- New head: (6,2)
- Check collision: No.
- Insert old head (7,2) into body list: body becomes [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (7,6): but wait, initial body is [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)]. After inserting (7,2) at front, it's [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)]. Then remove tail: the last element was (7,6), but after moving left, is the tail still (7,6)? No, because when you move left, the body shifts. Wait, no—the tail moves up by one if not eating.

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

After moving to a new position that's not the apple, the snake's body segments shift forward. So each segment moves one cell in the direction of movement, except the head which moves first.

So when you move left from (7,2) to (6,2):

- The old head (7,2) becomes BODY1.
- Each subsequent body segment moves up by one row: (7,3) becomes (6,3), but wait, no—each segment moves in the direction of the head's movement.

Wait, no. Actually, each body segment follows the snake's path. So when the head moves left to (6,2), each body segment also moves left by one cell, except the tail which might move differently depending on whether it's a growth move or not.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about how the body segments move after each step.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on the path rather than the exact movement of the body would be better for planning.

Given that the snake needs to reach (2,5), which is 5 left and 3 up from the head, maybe a path like:

1. Move "LEFT" as much as possible until x=2.
2. Then move "UP" until y=5.

This seems logical but needs to avoid collisions with body segments.

Another concern is that if the snake continues moving left too far ahead of its body, it might create a situation where the head can't move up because the body is blocking.

Perhaps interleaving "LEFT" and "UP" moves would be better. For example:

1. Move "LEFT" to (6,2).
2. Then move "UP" to (6,3).
3. Continue moving "UP" while moving left until reaching (2,5).

But I need to check if this is possible without the body colliding with itself.

Alternatively, moving up first might not be possible because the initial direction is down, and reversing would require a move in the opposite direction.

Wait, no—after moving left, the direction is "LEFT", so the next move can't be "UP" unless it's a reversal. Is reversing allowed after moving left?

No, I think that when you change direction, you can only do so by 90 degrees, but I'm not sure of the exact rules here. It might depend on whether the snake is considered to have reversed direction or not.

Given this uncertainty, perhaps the safest path is to continue moving left all the way to (2,2) and then move up to reach (2,5). This should allow the snake's body to shift in a way that doesn't block the head's movement.

So let's outline the moves:

Move 1: "LEFT" from (7,2) to (6,2).
- Direction becomes "LEFT".
- Body shifts: old head (7,2) is now BODY1.
- Tail moves up by one: tail was at (7,6), now at (7,5).

Move 2: "LEFT" from (6,2) to (5,2).
- Direction remains "LEFT".
- Old head (6,2) becomes BODY1.
- Tail moves up to (7,4).

Wait, no—if the tail was at (7,6) after move 1, moving left again would mean each body segment moves left as well. So after move 2:

- Body is [(6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)].
- Tail is now at (7,5 - 1?) No, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Actually, when the snake moves normally, each body segment follows the path of the head. So when the head moves left to (6,2), each body segment also moves left by one cell in their respective positions.

So after move 1:

- Body becomes [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)].
- Tail is at (7,5).

Wait, no—originally, the tail was at (7,6). After moving left to (6,2), the old head (7,2) becomes the new BODY1, and each body segment moves left by one. So:

- The first body segment was at (7,3) and moves to (6,3).
- Second: (7,4) -> (6,4).
- Third: (7,5) -> (6,5).
- Fourth: (7,6) -> (6,6).

But this doesn't make sense because the snake is moving left as a unit. I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Perhaps a better approach is to model the body segments as each following the head's position in their own columns. So when the head moves left by one, each body segment also moves left by one in their respective rows.

This would mean that after move 1:

- Head at (6,2).
- Body segments at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).

Wait, no—originally, the body was [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)]. After moving left as a group, each segment moves to x=6 in their respective y positions. So:

- (7,3) becomes (6,3).
- (7,4) becomes (6,4).
- (7,5) becomes (6,5).
- (7,6) becomes (6,6).

Then the new body is [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)].

Wait, no. The head moves to (6,2). The old head (7,2) becomes the first body segment. Then each subsequent body segment follows the head's movement from their own positions.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe focusing on the fact that each body segment is directly behind the one above it. So if the head moves left to (6,2), the next segment must also be at (6,3), and so on down the line.

This means that after move 1:

- Head: (6,2)
- Body: [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)]
- Tail: (7,5)

But wait, that doesn't make sense because if the head moves left, the entire snake shifts left. So actually, all body segments move left as well.

So after moving left:

- Head: (6,2)
- Body1: (7,2)
- Body2: (6,3)
- Body3: (5,4)
- Tail: (4,5)

Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe I need to visualize this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the body segments don't move horizontally but follow the head's vertical and horizontal movements as a group. This is getting too confusing, so maybe it's better to proceed with the initial plan of moving left until x=2 and then up, while keeping track of potential collisions.

Given that, here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Move "LEFT" from (7,2) to (6,2).
   - Check: No collision.
   - Body shifts left; tail moves accordingly.

2. Move "LEFT" from (6,2) to (5,2).
   - Check: No collision.
   - Continue shifting body.

3. Move "LEFT" from (5,2) to (4,2).
   - Check: No collision.
   - Body continues moving left.

4. Move "LEFT" from (4,2) to (3,2).
   - Check: No collision.
   - Now at x=3.

5. Now, direction is "LEFT". To start moving up, I need to change direction or make a move that allows turning without reversing immediately.

Wait, after moving left multiple times, the snake's direction is still "LEFT", so reversing would require changing direction to "RIGHT". Alternatively, can it turn while moving left?

Perhaps, but I'm not sure if that's allowed. Maybe the snake can start moving up once it's aligned properly.

From (3,2), the next move could be "UP" since the current direction is "LEFT", and reversing would mean going right, which isn't useful here. But actually, changing direction mid-move might require a 180-degree turn, which is not possible unless explicitly allowed.

I think that after moving left several times, the snake can start moving up without reversing because it's already aligned vertically towards the apple.

So from (3,2):

6. Move "UP" to (3,3).
   - Check: No collision.
   - Body shifts; tail moves up.

7. Move "UP" to (3,4).
   - Check: No collision.
   - Continue moving up.

8. Move "UP" to (3,5).

Now, the head is at (3,5), which is one row above the apple's y=5. But wait, the apple is at (2,5). So actually, after reaching x=3 and y=5, I need to adjust.

Perhaps from (3,2):

6. Move "UP" to (3,3).
7. Then move "LEFT" again to (2,3).
8. Then move "UP" to (2,4) and (2,5).

This way, the head can reach (2,5) without colliding with the body.

Let me outline this path:

1. Move 1: "LEFT" from (7,2) -> (6,2).
2. Move 2: "LEFT" from (6,2) -> (5,2).
3. Move 3: "LEFT" from (5,2) -> (4,2).
4. Move 4: "LEFT" from (4,2) -> (3,2).
5. Move 5: "UP" from (3,2) -> (3,3).
6. Move 6: "LEFT" from (3,3) -> (2,3).
7. Move 7: "UP" from (2,3) -> (2,4).
8. Move 8: "UP" from (2,4) -> (2,5).

At each step, I need to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with existing body segments.

For example, after move 1:

- Head at (6,2), body is [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)].
But wait, if all body segments move left, then they would be at:

- Body1: (6,2)
- Body2: (6,3)
- Body3: (6,4)
- Body4: (6,5)

Wait, no—that can't be because the head moved from (7,2) to (6,2), so the body should follow accordingly. Maybe each body segment is directly below the one above it.

So if the head is at (6,2), then:

- Body1: (6,2)
- Body2: (6,3)
- Body3: (6,4)
- Body4: (6,5)

But originally, they were all at x=7. So after moving left as a group, their new positions are x=6.

This means that the body is now along x=6 from y=2 to y=5.

Therefore, when moving "UP" from (3,2), the body will shift accordingly without colliding with itself because each segment moves up as a unit.

So continuing:

5. Move 5: "UP" from (3,2) -> (3,3).
   - Body shifts up; no collision.
6. Move 6: "LEFT" from (3,3) -> (2,3).
   - Check if any body segments are at x=2, y >=3.
   - Since the body is at x=6, this should be safe.
7. Move 7: "UP" from (2,3) -> (2,4).
8. Move 8: "UP" from (2,4) -> (2,5).

At each step, as long as the head doesn't pass through a body segment's position, it should be safe.

So this seems like a viable path without collisions.

Additionally, after reaching (2,5), the snake can coil or stay there, having achieved the goal.

Now, considering potential obstacles:

- At move 6, when moving left from (3,3) to (2,3), we need to ensure that no body segment is already at x=2. Since the original body was at x=7 and shifted to x=6 after move 1, they won't interfere.

- Similarly, moving up doesn't cross any existing body segments because each body part is moving up in tandem.

Therefore, this path should work without causing the snake to collide with itself.

In summary, the plan is:

1. Move left three times from (7,2) to (4,2).
2. Then move up once to (3,2).
3. Then move left again to (2,3).
4. Finally, move up twice to reach (2,5).

This sequence of eight moves should allow the snake to reach the apple at (2,5) without colliding with its own body.
</think>

The snake successfully reaches the apple by following a strategic path:

1. **Move left three times** from position (7,2) to (4,2).
2. **Move up once** to position (3,2).
3. **Move left again** to position (2,3).
4. **Move up twice** to reach the apple at position (2,5).

This sequence avoids self-collision and efficiently navigates to the target.

**Answer:** The snake can successfully reach the apple by moving left three times, then up once, left once more, and up twice, ultimately arriving at \((\boxed{2}, \boxed{5})\).
