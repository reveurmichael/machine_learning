this crossover it's important to get
 

19
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,470
this crossover it's important to get
this first step outside of his frame so

20
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:19,480
this first step outside of his frame so
 

21
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,230
this first step outside of his frame so
he feels threatened and actually shifts

22
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,240
he feels threatened and actually shifts
 

23
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,950
he feels threatened and actually shifts
over and then you can counter him the

24
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
over and then you can counter him the
 

25
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,750

31
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,550
shift their torso or turn to get over
this leg in any way so the defender

32
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:31,560
this leg in any way so the defender
 

33
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,389
this leg in any way so the defender
doesn't feel threatened by that shift so

34
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:33,399
doesn't feel threatened by that shift so
