{"moves": ["UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "To move the snake's head from (4,0) to the apple at (7,8), we first need to move up so that the head is at (4,1). Then, we need to move left to position the head at (3,1). Since the head cannot move beyond the body cells, we must move left again to place the head at (2,1) or (2,0), and finally, move down once to reach the apple at (7,8). By moving left twice, we ensure that there are no overlapping snake cells."}
