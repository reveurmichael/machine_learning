========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the current state of the snake and where it's heading. The head is at (0,6), facing "UP". There are body segments at [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)], so the tail is at (3,5). The apple is at (1,8).

I should check if moving in the current direction would cause a collision. Since the head is at (0,6) and facing "UP", moving up would take it to (0,7), which isn't occupied by any body segments except possibly the tail after moving. But the tail is currently at (3,5). So moving UP seems safe.

Next, I should consider if there's a better path that allows for more moves or doesn't get stuck later. Maybe moving RIGHT first would allow it to reach the apple without blocking itself in the future.

But wait, moving RIGHT from (0,6) would take the head to (1,6). Is this cell safe? Looking at the body segments: [(0,5), (1,5), ...]. The current head is at (0,6), so (1,6) isn't occupied. So it's safe.

Alternatively, moving UP first might allow reaching the apple faster. However, since the snake can only move in one direction per turn, I need to plan a path that doesn't get stuck.

I think moving RIGHT once would create more space for maneuvering towards the apple without immediately blocking itself.
</think>

The initial position of the head is (0,6) facing "UP". The body segments are at [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)], and the apple is at (1,8). Moving RIGHT once to (1,6) creates a clear path towards the apple while avoiding any immediate collisions. This move sets up the snake for future safe moves without blocking itself.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving Right provides a clear path towards the apple and avoids immediate collision with body segments."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (0, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (1, 8). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
