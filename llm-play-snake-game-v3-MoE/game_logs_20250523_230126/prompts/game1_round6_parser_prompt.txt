Okay, so I need to help plan a path for the snake from its current position at (5,4) towards the apple at (3,0) on a 10x10 grid. Let me break down how I should approach this.

First, let's understand the problem constraints and rules. The snake has a head and a body that extends backward. Each part of the body is adjacent to the one in front, and the tail can't go beyond the head. If the snake eats the apple, it grows by one segment but doesn't move its tail.

The movement update rule says when the snake moves, if the new head position would be on a body segment that's not the tail's current position, it dies. So I have to make sure that when moving or eating the apple, there are no such collisions.

I should start from (5,4) and aim for (3,0). Let me visualize the grid. Starting at (5,4), which is one row below the top right corner if 0 is bottom left. The target is way to the left of that.

I need to think about possible directions. Since I can't reverse direction on the first move after eating the apple, my initial moves have to be in non-reversed directions except when at the end of a move without an apple.

Let me consider each step:

1. **First Move**: From (5,4), since it's not the first move yet (because I haven't eaten the apple), direction can be any of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But if I go DOWN or UP, I might hit other parts of the grid. So maybe LEFT or RIGHT first.

Wait, but wait—since I'm not eating the apple yet, I have to check for collisions with body segments beyond the tail. Since the snake is just starting, there are no other parts except the body and the head. So moving in any direction should be safe as long as it doesn't go out of bounds.

But if I move DOWN, from (5,4) to (5,3). That's adjacent, so no collision with the tail yet. Similarly, LEFT would take me to (4,4).

Hmm, perhaps starting by moving RIGHT is better since that brings me closer horizontally. So maybe moving RIGHT to (6,4), but wait—no, because that might be into a body segment if the body hasn't extended beyond yet.

Wait no—the snake's body starts from the tail and extends backward. The given example had the snake with [Head, BODY1], which suggests that the rest of the body is behind it. So if I move RIGHT, I have to make sure that (6,4) isn't part of the existing body. But since no other information is given about the body segments, maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, moving DOWN from (5,4) would take me to (5,3), which is adjacent. Let me consider both options.

Wait, perhaps it's better to move RIGHT first to (6,4). That way, I stay on the same y-coordinate as before and can potentially avoid some obstacles later. But let me think about possible collisions.

If I go DOWN from (5,4) to (5,3), that is adjacent to the body segment at (5,4). So if my new head position after moving is (5,3), which is just below the tail's current position (which would be (5,4)). So in this case, I'm moving into a cell that is part of the body. But wait—the rule says if it's not the tail, then collision occurs.

Since I'm not eating the apple yet, and the new head is at (5,3), which is adjacent to (5,4). Is (5,3) part of the snake's body? Since the snake hasn't moved beyond the first step. Wait no—because each move after that would involve shifting the body.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when you compute new_head, it could be any position as long as it's adjacent to the last part before the shift. So if I move from (5,4) to (6,4), then the new_head is (6,4). The tail shifts back by one, so if the snake was [H, B1], after moving, H becomes (6,4), and B1 becomes None.

But since I haven't eaten the apple yet, I can move any direction as long as it's adjacent. So perhaps starting by moving RIGHT to (6,4). But then I have to consider future moves where maybe the apple is in a position that requires me to shift right again.

Wait, but if I keep moving RIGHT until I reach x=5 or beyond? No, because when I move right from (6,4), it becomes (7,4), and so on. But since there's no obstacle, except for maybe the body segments if they are part of the snake's body.

But perhaps it's better to move down instead. Let me think: moving DOWN would take me to (5,3). Then I have to check if that position is in any other body segment besides the tail.

Since the snake's body starts from the tail and extends backward, perhaps (5,3) isn't part of the snake's body yet. So no collision there.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT first might allow me to reach (6,4), then perhaps move DOWN or LEFT if needed.

Wait, but let me think about the final position: I need to get from (5,4) to (3,0). Let's compute the net movement required in x and y directions. Starting at (5,4), ending at (3,0).

The change is Δx = 3-5= -2, Δy=0-4=-4.

So overall, I need a move that reduces x by 2 and y by 4. But since movement can be done step by step, perhaps using a combination of RIGHT, DOWN, etc., but with careful consideration of possible collisions.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach: to find the minimal path from (5,4) to (3,0). Let's see:

The Manhattan distance is |5-3| + |4-0|= 2 +4=6 steps. So a straight line path would require moving LEFT twice and DOWN four times. But since movement has constraints on direction, I need to plan around the body.

But perhaps the snake can't take that direct path because of obstacles or body segments blocking it.

Alternatively, let's think about possible moves:

From (5,4):

1. Move RIGHT to (6,4)
2. Then from (6,4), move DOWN to (6,3)
3. From (6,3), move LEFT to (5,3)
4. Then perhaps other directions.

But I need to ensure that each step doesn't cause a collision with the body segments beyond the tail.

Wait, but since the snake's body is [H, B1], after moving, H becomes (new_head_x, new_head_y), and B1 becomes None. So when evaluating for collisions, if the next head moves into any B_i except the tail's current cell, it's a collision.

So as long as I plan the steps so that each move is adjacent to the previous body segment, which are all in order, that should be safe.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to start by moving DOWN first. Let me think:

From (5,4), moving DOWN would take me to (5,3). Then from there, I can try LEFT or RIGHT if possible.

But wait, let me consider the initial steps carefully:

- After moving DOWN to (5,3), the body segments become [(5,4) becomes (5,3)], and the tail shifts back. So the new snake is [H', B1'], where H' = (5,3). Then when I move again, I need to check if the new_head is adjacent to any existing B_i.

But perhaps this approach would cause more collisions down the line because the body segments might get too close.

Alternatively, moving RIGHT first:

- From (5,4) to (6,4). Now, the snake's head is (6,4), and the body segment that was at (5,4) becomes B1. The tail shifts back to None.

Then from (6,4), I can move DOWN to (6,3). Then again, moving RIGHT could take me to (7,4), but wait—since it's on x=7, which is within the grid. But I need to end at (3,0), so perhaps that's not efficient.

Alternatively, after (6,4) comes (6,3), then moving LEFT to (5,3). From there, maybe move DOWN again to (5,2). Then LEFT to (4,2), and so on. But this seems like a long path with possible collisions if I don't plan properly.

Wait, perhaps the key is to first move DOWN as much as possible without getting too close to other body segments. Let me see:

From (5,4), moving DOWN to (5,3). Then, since the new_head is at (5,3), which is adjacent to the previous tail's position (which was at (5,4)), so no collision.

Then from (5,3), I can move LEFT to (4,3). That is adjacent to the body segment that was behind it. Then from (4,3), maybe moving DOWN to (4,2), then LEFT to (3,2), etc., but wait—this seems inefficient and might lead me away from the apple.

Alternatively, after moving DOWN to (5,3), perhaps I should move RIGHT instead of LEFT next time. Let's try:

- From (5,3) moving RIGHT to (6,3). Then from there, maybe down again.

But this approach could be causing me to overshoot or get too far from the apple.

Wait, another idea: since the snake can only change direction if it moves in a way that doesn't reverse the first move, perhaps I should avoid moving back on the first step. But once I start moving other directions, I can adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal path is to move DOWN four times and LEFT twice, but ensuring that each step doesn't cause a collision with existing body segments.

But let me see: from (5,4), moving DOWN four times would take me to (5,0). But then I have to move LEFT twice more. However, as I'm not eating the apple yet, this seems feasible, but perhaps there are other constraints.

Wait, but if I start by moving DOWN each time, that might cause the snake's body segments to be adjacent to each other and possibly interfere with any existing body parts beyond the tail.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to plan a route that first moves towards x=5 or x=6, then down as needed.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to think about the target: (3,0). Let me compute how much I have to move in each direction:

From (5,4) to (3,0): Δx = -2, Δy = -4.

So net movement is LEFT and DOWN. But since the snake can't change direction on first step after moving, perhaps I need to alternate directions or find a way to reach that.

Wait, but if I start by moving RIGHT twice:

- From (5,4) to (6,4), then to (7,4). Wait—no, because from (6,4), the next move would require moving DOWN, perhaps. But let me plan step by step.

Let's try this path:

1. Move RIGHT from (5,4) to (6,4).

2. Then from (6,4), move RIGHT again to (7,4). Now, from (7,4), I have a body segment at (6,4) and the tail is None.

3. From (7,4), perhaps moving DOWN to (7,3).

But wait, this seems like it's going away from the apple, which is at (3,0).

Alternatively, maybe after step 1 and 2, I should start moving DOWN:

- From (5,4) to (6,4), then to (7,4). Then move DOWN to (7,3), etc., but this seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps the key is to make sure that each new_head is adjacent to the last B_i. So, for example:

- Start at (5,4).

1. Move RIGHT to (6,4): This is allowed because it's adjacent and part of the body segment extending from the tail.

2. From (6,4), move DOWN to (6,3). Now, the snake's head is (6,3), and the previous B_i was at (6,4).

Wait, but that would make me collide with the existing body segments beyond the tail? Wait no—because when moving from (5,4) to (6,4), the new_head is (6,4). The tail shifts back to None. Then, in step 2, I move down to (6,3). Now, my B_i is at (6,3), which was not part of any existing body segment beyond the tail before this step.

Wait no—because after moving from (5,4) to (6,4), the snake's segments are [(5,4), (6,4)], with H=(5,4). Then when I move down to (6,3), which is adjacent to (6,4), it's fine. So that's allowed.

Then step 3: from (6,3), move LEFT to (5,3). That's okay because it's adjacent to the existing B_i at (6,3).

Wait no—actually, when moving to (5,3), I'm moving into a position where it's just below (6,4) which was part of the body. So that would be safe.

Then step 4: from (5,3), move DOWN to (5,2). That is adjacent to (5,3).

Step 5: from (5,2), move LEFT to (4,2). Adjacent.

And so on... but this seems like it's moving in circles around the current area. Maybe I'm missing a better approach.

Wait, perhaps the optimal path is to first move DOWN as much as possible without hitting any body segments beyond the tail.

From (5,4), moving down four times:

- (5,4) → (5,3) [down once]
- (5,3) → (5,2) [down again]
- (5,2) → (5,1)
- (5,1) → (5,0)

But then from (5,0), I need to move LEFT twice more. But let me check:

After moving down four times to (5,0):

From (5,0), the snake's head is at (5,0). The body segment that was at (5,1) becomes B1, and the tail is None.

Then, from (5,0), I can move LEFT twice to reach (3,0).

But wait, when moving down four times, each step requires checking if it collides with any other segments. But since I'm only moving within x=5, y from 4 down to 0, and the body is at y >=1, perhaps no collision occurs because the new_head is always directly below a segment.

Wait, but in this path:

- Move DOWN four times: (5,4) → (5,3), then (5,2), etc., up to (5,0).

Then from (5,0), move LEFT twice to (3,0). But I need to check if moving LEFT would cause any collision with existing body segments.

Wait, when I'm at (5,0), the previous B_i is (5,1). So moving LEFT to (4,0) would make me adjacent to that. Then from (4,0), moving LEFT again to (3,0).

But wait, after four moves DOWN:

- From (5,4) → (5,3): no collision.

- From (5,3) → (5,2): no collision.

- From (5,2) → (5,1): yes, because the tail is None, and moving to (5,1) would be adjacent to nothing beyond the current body segments except for (5,4), which was the initial position. But when I moved down four times from (5,4) to (5,0), that's okay.

Wait, but after the first move DOWN, (5,3) is now part of the body. Then from there, any moves would have to be adjacent to (5,3). Moving LEFT would take me to (4,3), which is not in contact with any other segments except possibly the initial one at (6,4).

But wait, moving LEFT from (5,3) takes me to (4,3), which is only one step away from (5,4). Since I'm not eating the apple yet, it's safe.

Hmm. So perhaps this path would work:

1. Move DOWN four times: (5,4) → (5,3) [step 1]
2. From (5,3), move LEFT twice to reach (3,3) [steps 2 and 3]. Wait, but wait—this is a problem.

Wait no—if I start at (5,4), move down four times to (5,0). Then from (5,0), I need to move LEFT twice more. But let's plan step by step:

Step 1: (5,4) → (5,3): Adjacent to the initial tail, which is fine.

Step 2: (5,3) → (5,2): Also adjacent.

Step 3: (5,2) → (5,1): Ok.

Step 4: (5,1) → (5,0): But then from (5,0), I have to move LEFT twice:

From (5,0):

- Step 5: (5,0) → (4,0)
- Step 6: (4,0) → (3,0)

Now, the snake is at [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), ...], but wait, no. After four moves DOWN, I have:

Segments after step 4:

- H = (5,4)
- B1: (5,3)
- B2: (5,2)
- B3: (5,1)
- B4: (5,0)

Then from (5,0), the next moves would be LEFT to (4,0) and then LEFT again to (3,0).

But I need to make sure that each move doesn't cause a collision with existing body segments beyond the tail.

After moving down four times:

- The new_head is (5,0).
- Then, from (5,0), moving LEFT twice would take me to (4,0) and then (3,0).

But in terms of checking for collisions, each move should be adjacent to the last B_i before shifting.

Wait, when I'm at (5,0):

- The current head is H=(5,0).
- The previous segments are B1=(5,1), B2=(5,2), B3=(5,3), and B4=(5,4).

So moving LEFT to (4,0) would require that this new_head (4,0) is adjacent to the last B_i at (5,1). But (4,0) is not adjacent to (5,1); it's two steps away in x and one step up. So no collision.

Therefore, moving LEFT twice from (5,0) would be safe.

So this path seems possible:

- Move DOWN four times: (5,4) → (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0)
- Then move LEFT twice to reach (3,0)

But let me check each step in detail for any collisions.

Starting at (5,4):

1. From (5,4) → (5,3): This is adjacent and part of the body, so no collision.

2. From (5,3) → (5,2): Adjacent to existing segments beyond tail, but not beyond the current body except for (6,4), which was the initial segment. Wait, I'm confused now—maybe this approach isn't correct because moving from (5,3) down again would go below the initial head.

Wait a minute—if I move DOWN four times, each time to (5,3), then (5,2), etc., and when I reach (5,0), that's adjacent to (5,1). So no collision between these steps.

Then from (5,0):

- Moving LEFT once takes me to (4,0)
- Checking if this is adjacent to the last B_i at (5,1): The distance is one in x and one in y. Not adjacent. So that's okay.
- Then moving again to (3,0). Now checking adjacency with B_i=(5,1), which is two in x, so not adjacent.

Therefore, this path seems feasible without any collisions. But let me make sure that when the snake moves down four times from (5,4) to (5,0), it's okay because each move was within y=3 to y=0, which are all beyond the initial tail at y=1 and up.

Wait no—the initial tail is at (6,4). So moving down from (5,4) would go into y=3, but that is still adjacent to the initial tail's position. Hmm, perhaps this approach is okay because each move doesn't land on any existing body segments beyond the current one.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it—maybe just plan a movement pattern that makes the snake reach (3,0) without any issues.

Wait another thought: if I first move RIGHT twice to (6,4), then DOWN four times to (5,0). From there, LEFT twice to (3,0). But let me check whether moving from (6,4) down four times would cause any collisions:

When I'm at (6,4):

1. Move RIGHT once: (7,4)
   - This is adjacent to the initial head at (5,4), which was part of the tail after the first move.
   - But since we're moving from (5,4) to (6,4), that's allowed.

2. From (6,4), move RIGHT again: (7,4)
   - Similarly adjacent to the initial head and safe.

3. Then moving DOWN four times:

- From (7,4) → (7,3)
- Then (7,2)
- Then (7,1)
- Then (7,0)

But wait, when I'm at (6,4), the next move is RIGHT to (7,4). That's okay.

Then from (7,4), moving DOWN four times:

- (7,3): Adjacent.
- (7,2): Adjacent.
- (7,1): Adjacent.
- (7,0): Adjacent.

But then after that, I have to move LEFT twice from (5,0) to reach (3,0).

Wait, but when I'm at (7,0), moving LEFT would take me to (6,0), which is adjacent to the initial head's position. No collision there because it was part of the body.

Therefore, perhaps this path also works without any collisions.

Hmm... so both approaches seem possible. Maybe either one can work.

But let me think about another approach—starting by moving LEFT twice from (5,4) as the first two moves:

1. Move LEFT once to (4,4)
2. Move LEFT again to (3,4)

Now, I have a segment at (3,4). Then move DOWN four times to (3,0):

- From (3,4) → (3,3)
- (3,2)
- (3,1)
- (3,0)

But wait, from (3,4), moving LEFT twice would take me to (1,4), which is adjacent to nothing except the initial segment at (5,4). But since I'm on x=3, and (5,4) is two steps away in x. No collision.

Then from (3,0):

- Moving RIGHT three times would reach (6,0)
   - Checking for collisions: (5,0) → adjacent? Let's see.
     - (6,0) would be adjacent to (5,1), which was part of the body.
     - Wait, no. After moving DOWN four times from (3,4):

Segments after step 4:

- H=(3,4)
- B1=(3,3)
- B2=(3,2)
- B3=(3,1)
- B4=(3,0)

Then from (3,0), the snake needs to move RIGHT three times more. But wait, this would take it beyond x=6 if we don't consider any further moves.

Wait, but initially, after four DOWNs, we were at (3,0). Now, moving RIGHT three times: (4,0) → (5,0) is next, which is already part of the body. So that would be a collision because when I'm at (3,0), and move RIGHT to (4,0), it's adjacent to (3,1), but since I just moved into (4,0), which was not previously a segment. Wait no—moving from H=(3,0) to (4,0): I have to check if this new_head is adjacent to the last B_i before shifting.

Wait, when moving from (3,0) right again:

The new_head is (4,0). The previous segments were at (3,1), (3,2), etc. So checking adjacency between (3,1) and (4,0): that's a distance of 1 in x and -1 in y. Not adjacent.

Wait no—the check should be whether the new_head is directly above or below any existing segment beyond the tail. But when I'm moving right from (3,0), which was previously part of B_i=(3,1). So (4,0) would need to be adjacent to either (3,1)'s y+1 or y-1.

But since (3,1)'s position is at x=3, then for the new_head at (4,0), checking if it's adjacent:

The distance from (3,1) is 1 in x and -1 in y. So not directly above or below. Therefore, no collision.

Wait, but that might not be correct because when moving from H=(3,0), the new_head would be placed at (4,0). The previous segments are B_i's: (3,1), (3,2), etc. So to avoid a collision, (4,0) must be adjacent to any of these.

But since it is not, that's okay. Similarly for all subsequent moves.

So this approach seems possible as well without any collisions.

Hmm... so perhaps the optimal path isn't necessarily moving four times down and two lefts. Maybe other combinations are better in terms of minimizing steps or getting closer to the target.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal number of steps is 6: four DOWNs from (5,4) to (5,0), then LEFT twice to (3,0). Let me count:

1. Move DOWN → (5,3)
2. DOWN → (5,2)
3. DOWN → (5,1)
4. DOWN → (5,0)
5. LEFT → (4,0)
6. LEFT → (3,0)

That's 6 steps.

Is there a shorter path?

Wait, perhaps:

- From (5,4), move RIGHT once to (6,4).
- Then DOWN four times: (6,3) → (6,2) → (6,1) → (6,0).

Then from (6,0):

- LEFT three times: (5,0) → (4,0) → (3,0) → (2,0). Wait no—wait I think that's a different approach.

Wait in this case:

Segments after moving RIGHT once to (6,4), then DOWN four times to (6,0):

- H = (6,4)
- B1 = (6,3)
- B2 = (6,2)
- B3 = (6,1)
- B4 = (6,0)

Then from (6,0), moving LEFT three times:

(5,0) → (4,0) → (3,0) → (2,0). Wait no—no. From (6,0), moving LEFT once to (5,0), then again to (4,0), and again to (3,0).

But wait, from (6,0):

- Moving LEFT to (5,0): is this adjacent? The previous segment at (6,1). So new_head would be (5,0). Checking if it's adjacent to (6,1): x difference 1, y difference -1. Not directly above or below.

So that should be safe.

Then moving LEFT again: from (5,0) → (4,0).

Again, check adjacency with previous segment at (6,1), which is two steps away in x—so no collision.

Similarly, the next move to (3,0) would require checking against (6,1). No collision because they are four steps apart. So this path seems safe without any collisions.

So total steps:

- 1 RIGHT from (5,4)
- 4 DOWNs → 5 moves
- 3 LEFTs from (6,0): 3 moves

Wait that's 1 + 5 + 3 = 9 moves? That's more than the previous approach. So maybe the first approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a path that gets to (3,0) in fewer steps without any collisions.

Another thought: what if we move LEFT twice from (5,4), then DOWN four times, then RIGHT three times?

Let me see:

1. Move LEFT once → (4,4)
2. LEFT again → (3,4)
3. DOWN four times:
   a. (3,4) → (3,3)
   b. (3,3) → (3,2)
   c. (3,2) → (3,1)
   d. (3,1) → (3,0)

Then from (3,0), move RIGHT three times to reach (6,0). But wait that would go further away. Alternatively:

Wait no—I think after moving LEFT twice from (5,4):

- H=(3,4)
- B1=(3,3)
- B2=(3,2)
- B3=(3,1)
- B4=(3,0)

Then from (3,0), moving RIGHT three times:

→(4,0) → (5,0) → (6,0). Wait that's moving three steps to the right. Then from (6,0), we can't move further without collision.

Wait but in this case, after getting to (6,0), how do you get to (3,0)?

That seems complicated because from (6,0) you have to move LEFT three times—so that's three steps. That adds up:

1. Move LEFT twice → 2 moves
2. DOWN four times → 4 moves
3. RIGHT three times → 3 moves

Total: 9 moves.

Hmm... perhaps the first approach of moving DOWN four times from (5,4) and then LEFT twice is better with 6 steps, avoiding any collisions.

But wait another idea: maybe move RIGHT once to (6,4), then DOWN four times, then LEFT three times. Let's check:

1. Move RIGHT → (6,4)
2. DOWN four times:
   a. (6,4) → (6,3)
   b. (6,3) → (6,2)
   c. (6,2) → (6,1)
   d. (6,1) → (6,0)

Now from (6,0):

- Move LEFT three times: (5,0) → (4,0) → (3,0). That's 3 moves.

So total steps:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN four times
3. LEFT three times

Total of 8 moves? Wait, that can't be right because in this path, after moving RIGHT to (6,4), then DOWN four times brings us to (6,0). Then LEFT three from there: yes, three moves.

So total steps:

1 RIGHT → move to (6,4)
2 DOWN × 4 → (6,0)
3 LEFT × 3 → (3,0)

That's 8 moves. Let me check for any collisions in each step:

- Moving from (5,4) → (6,4): adjacent? H=(5,4), B1=(6,4). Yes, they're adjacent.

- Then moving DOWN four times: each new_head is one below the previous. Each should be adjacent to existing segments beyond tail. Since x increases by 1, y decreases by 1 each time. The initial tail was at (6,3) etc. So for example, from (5,4) → (6,4): check if (7,4) is adjacent? No problem.

Similarly, moving from (6,4) to (6,3): same logic. Then to (6,2), (6,1), (6,0). All are adjacent to the initial tail beyond y=1 and x beyond 5.

Then from (6,0):

Moving LEFT to (5,0): check if it's adjacent to any existing segment. It is not; previous segments were at y=4,3,2,1. So no collision.

Similarly, moving from (5,0) → (4,0), etc., but wait after that—wait, we are at (6,0). To reach (3,0), need to move LEFT three times.

But (6,0) is part of B_i=(6,1), (6,2), etc. So moving from H=(6,0) → (5,0): check if it's adjacent to any segment beyond the tail. The distance would be 1 in x and -1 in y—so not directly above or below.

Similarly for other steps:

From (5,0) → (4,0), etc., each is two steps away from existing segments at higher x, so no collision.

Therefore, this path seems valid without any collisions. So total moves: 8.

But wait earlier when I moved four DOWNs first and then LEFTs, it took me 6 steps, which seems better because it doesn't involve moving around.

Wait but in the other approach where I move RIGHT once, DOWN four times, and LEFT three times, that's 8 moves. Which is worse than the 6-step approach of four DOWNs followed by two LEFTs.

So perhaps the optimal path is to do four DOWNs from (5,4) → (5,0), then two LEFTs to reach (3,0).

Let me recount:

1. From (5,4):
   a. Move RIGHT once: (6,4)
   b. Then move DOWN three times:
      i. (6,4) → (6,3)
      ii. (6,3) → (6,2)
      iii. (6,2) → (6,1)
      iv. (6,1) → (6,0)
   c. Then move LEFT twice to (5,0) and (4,0).

Wait no—I think the four DOWNs would be from (5,4), so let me see:

- Move RIGHT once: (6,4)
- DOWN three times:
   a. (6,3)
   b. (6,2)
   c. (6,1)
   d. (6,0)
- Then LEFT twice to (5,0) and (4,0).

Total steps:

1. RIGHT
2. DOWN × 3 → 3 moves
3. LEFT × 2 → 2 moves

That's 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 moves.

Wait that seems better than the 8-step approach I considered earlier. So total of 6 moves: RIGHT, then DOWN three times, then LEFT twice.

Let me visualize this:

Start at (5,4).

1. Move RIGHT once to (6,4). Now segments are H=(6,4), B_i=(7,4) etc.
2. Then move DOWN three times:
   a. (6,4) → (6,3)
   b. (6,3) → (6,2)
   c. (6,2) → (6,1)
   d. (6,1) → (6,0)
3. Now at (6,0). Move LEFT twice:
   a. (5,0)
   b. (4,0)

So that's 6 moves.

Now, checking for collisions in each step:

- Step 2a: Moving from H=(6,4) to (6,3): adjacent? Yes, because it's directly below. So no collision.
- Step 2b: From (6,3) → (6,2): yes, adjacent.
- Step 2c: From (6,2) → (6,1): yes, adjacent.
- Step 2d: From (6,1) → (6,0): yes, adjacent.

Then from (6,0), moving LEFT to (5,0):
- Check if (4,0) is adjacent. It's two steps away in x and same y. So no collision.

From (5,0), moving LEFT to (4,0):
- Again, check if (3,0) is adjacent. Three steps away from existing segments at y=4, etc.—no collision.

Therefore, this path seems valid without any collisions, reaching (4,0). But wait, the target was (3,0), not (4,0). So perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait no—I thought to get to (3,0). Wait let me recount:

No—wait in my plan above, after moving RIGHT once and DOWN three times and LEFT twice, I end at (6,0) → (5,0) → (4,0), which is (4,0). But the problem statement says "target position: 3." So perhaps there was a miscalculation here.

Wait no—the initial target was (3,0), but in my plan above, I ended at (4,0). That can't be right. So did I make an error?

Let me check:

In this path:

1. From (5,4):
   a. RIGHT once → (6,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. 3 moves: (6,4) → (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1)
3. LEFT twice to reach (5,0), then (4,0).

Wait that would end at (4,0). That's not the target of (3,0). So perhaps I need to adjust.

Ah! Wait in step 2c, moving from (6,1) → (6,0). Then in step 3a, moving LEFT once: (5,0).

Wait but then after that, if you move LEFT again, you get (4,0), which is the target. But no—it's supposed to be 3.

Hmm—that indicates a miscalculation because I'm not at (3,0) in this path.

So perhaps I need another approach where I end up at (3,0). Let me think again.

Wait maybe moving LEFT once and then RIGHT twice instead of LEFT twice. Or something else?

Alternatively, after step 2d: from (6,0) → (5,0), then move LEFT once to get to (4,0), which is not the target—maybe I need another approach.

Let me try a different plan:

Start at (5,4):

1. RIGHT → (6,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. (6,3) → B_i=(7,3)
   b. (6,2) → B_i=(7,2)
   c. (6,1) → B_i=(7,1)
   d. (6,0) → B_i=(7,0)
3. Now at (6,0). From here:

Option: move LEFT once to (5,0), then DOWN three times again? No, perhaps that's not the best.

Alternatively, from (6,0):

- Move LEFT once → (5,0)
- Then LEFT twice more → (4,0) and (3,0).

Wait but no—wait:

After moving LEFT once to (5,0), then I have two more LEFTs: total of three moves. So (5,0) → (4,0) and (3,0). That's three steps from (6,0). But that would end at (3,0).

Wait but earlier in this plan:

1. From (5,4): RIGHT once → (6,4)
2. DOWN three times to reach (6,0)
3. Then LEFT once to get to (5,0), and then two more LEFTs: total of 3 moves from (6,0) to (5,0), then (4,0), then (3,0).

Wait but that would require moving three steps after being at (6,0). So from (6,0):

- Moving LEFT once → (5,0)
- Then DOWN × two more times? No—it's only moving LEFTs.

So I think this path is not working. Let me re-express it:

Plan 2:

Start at (5,4).

1. RIGHT once → (6,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. (6,3) → H=(6,3), B_i=(7,3)
   b. (6,2) → B_i=(7,2)
   c. (6,1) → B_i=(7,1)
   d. (6,0) → B_i=(7,0)
3. From (6,0):
   a. LEFT once → (5,0)
   b. DOWN three times? No—because that would take me further away.
   c. Alternatively, I can't move any more downwards without going beyond the initial tails.

Wait but perhaps from (6,0), moving LEFT three times to reach (3,0). Wait no:

From (6,0) → (5,0) is one move. So that's 1 step, not 3. Therefore, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting the steps.

Alternatively, maybe the initial plan of four DOWNs then two LEFTs gives me to (4,0), but perhaps there's another path where I end at (3,0).

Wait no—I think my first approach is correct because after moving DOWN three times from (6,4) I reach (6,1), which allows for two more steps to reach (5,0) and then (4,0). That ends at (4,0), not (3,0).

So perhaps another plan: move LEFT once first.

Let me try:

Plan 3:

Start at (5,4):

1. LEFT once → (4,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. (4,4) → (4,3)
   b. (4,3) → (4,2)
   c. (4,2) → (4,1)
   d. (4,1) → (4,0)
3. Now at (4,0). From here:

Option: move LEFT once to reach (3,0). But that would require moving two more steps after being at (4,0).

Wait but no—wait from (4,0), I need to move LEFT twice to get to (2,0) and then perhaps something else. No—that doesn't lead me to (3,0).

Alternatively, is there another way?

Wait maybe when moving DOWN three times from (4,4):

a → (4,3)
b → (4,2)
c → (4,1)
d → (4,0)

So at (4,0), move LEFT once to (3,0). But that's only one step; the target is (3,0).

Wait perhaps I can make it with:

Plan 3:

Start at (5,4):

1. Move LEFT once to (4,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3) → H=(4,3), B_i=(5,3)
   b. (4,2) → H=(4,2), B_i=(5,2)
   c. (4,1) → H=(4,1), B_i=(5,1)
   d. (4,0) → H=(4,0), B_i=(5,0)
3. Now at (4,0). From here:

Option 1: Move LEFT once to (3,0).

But wait—no, because each DOWN move is one step down from the current y-coordinate.

Wait no—the steps after step 2 would be moving from H=(4,0) to B_i=(5,0), which requires just one step. So I have:

After moving to (4,0):

- Move LEFT once: (3,0). That's one more move.

But the target is (3,0), so that's two moves after being at (4,0).

Wait but how can I reach (4,0) in such a way that after moving LEFT once from there I land on (3,0)?

Because in my current plan, when I'm at (4,0):

- I move LEFT once to (3,0). So total moves: 1 (step 2a) + 1 (step 3a) = 2 steps. So that's acceptable.

Wait but no—that would end me at (3,0), which is the target.

So let me re-express Plan 3:

Plan 3:

Start at (5,4):

1. Move LEFT once → (4,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3) → H=(4,3), B_i=(5,3)
   b. (4,2) → H=(4,2), B_i=(5,2)
   c. (4,1) → H=(4,1), B_i=(5,1)
   d. (4,0) → H=(4,0), B_i=(5,0)
3. From (4,0):
   a. Move LEFT once → (3,0). That's one move.

So total steps:

- 1 LEFT
- 3 DOWNs
- 1 LEFT

That's 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 moves.

Wait but in step 2a, I went from (4,4) to (4,3), which is one step. Then in step 3a, move to (3,0): another step. So total of five steps: 1+3+1=5.

But does that path have any collisions?

Let's verify each movement:

Step 2a: (4,4) → (4,3). Are they adjacent? No—directly below, so yes, no collision.

From H=(4,3) to B_i=(5,3): correct. Similarly for other steps in step 2.

After that, at (4,0):

Move LEFT once: (3,0). That's one step from (4,0), which is two steps away? No—wait x decreases by 1 each time, so from (4,0) to (3,0)—only one step. But according to the target, it should be at (3,0).

Wait in my initial plan, I have:

After being at (4,0):

- Move LEFT once → (3,0): that's correct.

So total steps are 1 (from step 2) + 3 (step 2) + 1 (step 3a) = 5 moves. But the target is (3,0), so this seems to work.

But let me double-check all movements:

- Starting at (5,4):
   - Step 1: LEFT → (4,4)
   - Steps 2a-d: DOWN ×3 from (4,4): (4,3) → B_i=(5,3); (4,2)→B_i=(5,2); (4,1)→B_i=(5,1); (4,0)→B_i=(5,0)
   - Step 3a: LEFT once from (4,0): to (3,0)

Yes, that seems correct. Now, checking for collisions:

- Moving LEFT in step 2 is fine, no problem.
- Moving DOWN three times from (4,4) lands at (4,1), then (4,0). So each down movement goes from current y to one less: all adjacent correctly.

No horizontal or vertical jumps beyond the initial tails. So that should be correct.

So with this plan, I end up at (3,0) in five moves. But earlier when I thought of another plan where I was ending at (4,0), but actually by moving LEFT once after being at (4,0), it's acceptable.

Wait, so the target is (3,0). So my new plan:

After reaching (4,0):

- Move LEFT once → (3,0).

Yes. That's correct.

So this path seems to reach the target in five moves.

But wait—let me count again.

Plan 3 steps:

1. Step 1: LEFT from (5,4) → (4,4)
2. Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   - (4,4)→(4,3)
   - (4,3)→(4,2)
   - (4,2)→(4,1)
   - (4,1)→(4,0)
3. Step 3a: LEFT from (4,0) → (3,0).

Total steps:

- 1 (step1)
- 3 (steps2)
- 1 (step3)
Total: 5 moves.

Yes, that seems to be correct.

Wait, but in this case, can I reach (3,0) with just five moves? That's better than the previous approach where it ended at (4,0).

So perhaps this is a better plan. So let me write down all steps clearly:

1. Step 1: LEFT from (5,4) → (4,4)
2. Step 2a: DOWN from (4,4) → (4,3)
3. Step 2b: DOWN from (4,3) → (4,2)
4. Step 2c: DOWN from (4,2) → (4,1)
5. Step 2d: DOWN from (4,1) → (4,0)
6. Step 3a: LEFT from (4,0) → (3,0)

So total of 5 moves.

Wait but is there any possibility for collision in this path?

After step1, moving LEFT once to (4,4). Then DOWNs from (4,4), which are all below the tails. So each move is adjacent correctly—no collision.

At (4,0): when I move LEFT once, to (3,0)—which is two x's away. Since the initial tail at x=5, y=0 is a horizontal line. Moving from (4,0) left to (3,0) is fine because it doesn't intersect with any vertical lines except in cases where there are multiple moves.

Wait but in this case, the only other line is the initial tail at x=5, which is a horizontal line. So when moving from (4,0) left once, we're just along the y=0 line towards x=3. No collisions with any vertical lines because all other vertical lines are either to the right of 4 or on 4.

Wait no—vertical lines in the initial setup are at x=5 and onwards. Wait, so moving from (4,0) left once would be along y=0 line towards x=3, but that's fine since there are no vertical lines in that area except perhaps x=5 is a horizontal tail. So yes, moving to (3,0) isn't interfering with any other vertical lines.

So I think this path works without any collisions and ends at (3,0) in five moves.

But wait—did I count correctly?

Plan 3:

1. LEFT from (5,4): x becomes 4. That's one move.
2. DOWN three times: y decreases by 1 each time to reach (4,0). Three moves here.
3. LEFT once from (4,0): that brings x to 3. One more move.

Total of 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 moves.

Yes, this seems correct.

But wait—I thought initially I was ending at (4,0), but now by moving LEFT once after being there, it's acceptable.

Wait no—wait in Plan 3:

After step2d: (4,1)→(4,0).

Then step3a: (4,0) → (3,0): that would be moving left from x=4 to x=3. That is a horizontal move along y=0.

Yes, it's allowed because the initial vertical tail at x=5 isn't being touched here; it's just a line on y=0 from x=5 onwards, which doesn't interfere with the current x=4 line moving left.

Thus, Plan 3 seems correct and efficient in reaching (3,0) in five moves.

But perhaps I can find an even shorter path. Let me think of another approach.

Alternative Approach:

Let me try a plan that ends at (2,1). No—wait the target is (3,0).

Alternatively, let's consider going from (5,4):

Option: DOWN three times to reach y=1, then LEFT twice to x=3. But no—I think I already did that.

Wait, but in Plan 3, I ended at (3,0). So maybe another way is:

Plan 4:

Start at (5,4):

1. DOWN once → (5,3)
2. DOWN again → (5,2)
3. DOWN again → (5,1)
4. LEFT twice → (3,1) and then (2,1).

Wait no—wait I'm ending at (2,1), but the target is (3,0). So that's not helpful.

Alternative Idea: Maybe moving right from some point?

But if you move right beyond y=5? No, because the initial lines are up to y=4.

Wait, so perhaps another approach:

Plan 5:

Start at (5,4):

1. LEFT once → (4,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3) → H=(4,3), B_i=(5,3)
   b. (4,2) → H=(4,2), B_i=(5,2)
   c. (4,1) → H=(4,1), B_i=(5,1)
   d. (4,0) → H=(4,0), B_i=(5,0)
3. From (4,0):
   a. LEFT twice → reach (2,0). But that's not the target.

Wait no—wait after being at (4,0), moving LEFT once would be to (3,0), which is the target.

So Plan 5:

Same as Plan 3, just ending at (3,0).

Alternatively, can I find a path where I reach (2,1) and then go further?

Wait no, because I need to end at (3,0). So perhaps that's not helpful.

Another Idea: Maybe moving from (4,0) to (5,0), but then that would take me past the target. Wait if you move from (4,0) to (5,0), is that allowed?

Because the initial vertical line at x=5 is a horizontal line. So moving from y=0 at x=4 to y=0 at x=5 is not crossing any other lines except possibly another line.

Wait no—because there are only two lines:

1. Vertical: x=5, which is a horizontal line from (5, -infty) to (5, +infty).
2. Two slanted lines with negative slopes that go through certain points.

So moving along y=0 from x=4 to x=5 would be fine because it's just the continuation of the initial vertical line at y=0 beyond x=5.

Therefore, perhaps in Plan 3, after being at (4,0):

- Moving LEFT once → (3,0), which is acceptable because we can move on the same horizontal line without crossing any other lines.

Thus, yes, it's correct.

So with that, I think the minimal number of moves to reach (3,0) is five. But wait in Plan 4, ending at (2,1) would require:

Plan 6:

Start at (5,4):

1. LEFT once → (4,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3) → H=(4,3), B_i=(5,3)
   b. (4,2) → H=(4,2), B_i=(5,2)
   c. (4,1) → H=(4,1), B_i=(5,1)
   d. (4,0) → H=(4,0), B_i=(5,0)
3. From (4,0):
   a. RIGHT twice to x=6
   But that's not the target.

Wait no—wait I'm moving right beyond 4? No—if you're at y=0 and move right, it would be towards positive x-axis beyond (4,0). That is fine because there are no other lines in that area except for any existing vertical or slanted lines. Since all vertical lines start from x=5 onwards.

Wait, so moving to x=6 from (4,0) is acceptable because the only line at y=0 starts at x=5. So yes, you can move beyond it without crossing other lines.

So Plan 6 would end up at (6,0). But that's not helpful for our target of (3,0).

Alternatively, after being at (4,0), moving LEFT once to (3,0) as before.

Thus, same plan as before: five moves.

But perhaps another path is shorter? Let me see:

Wait, in Plan 5, I have five moves—wait no. Let's recount the steps for Plan 3 and Plan 5.

Plan 3 has 5 moves, but Plan 5 also ends at (3,0) in four or five?

Wait let me write it step by step:

Plan 5:

1. Step 1: LEFT from (5,4) → (4,4)
2. Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   a. (4,4)→(4,3)
   b. (4,3)→(4,2)
   c. (4,2)→(4,1)
   d. (4,1)→(4,0)
3. Step 5a: LEFT once from (4,0) → (3,0).

Wait that's five moves.

So both Plan 3 and Plan 5 are at five moves but different paths—end points same.

But for the problem statement: we need to reach (3,0). So regardless of path, minimal number is four or five?

Wait in my initial plan, I thought it ends at (4,0), which took six moves:

Plan 1:

1. LEFT → (4,4)
2. DOWN three times:
   a. (4,4)→(4,3)
   b. (4,3)→(4,2)
   c. (4,2)→(4,1)
   d. (4,1)→(4,0)
3. LEFT once → (3,0)

That's six moves.

But in Plan 3:

5 moves to reach (3,0).

Thus, perhaps five is the minimal number of steps.

Wait but I just realized that there might be another path where you can end at (2,1) with four moves?

Plan 7:

Start at (5,4):

1. LEFT → (4,4)
2. DOWN once:
   a. (4,4)→(4,3)
   b. (4,3)→(4,2)
   c. (4,2)→(4,1)
   d. (4,1)→(4,0)
3. LEFT twice → reach (2,0). But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, Plan 7:

1. Step1: LEFT to (4,4)
2. Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)
3. From (5,0), LEFT once → (4,0). Not helpful.

No, that doesn't help. So I think Plan 3 is the best for four or five moves.

Wait but let me check another plan:

Plan 8: Starting at (5,4):

1. DOWN to (5,3)
2. DOWN again to (5,2)
3. DOWN again to (5,1)
4. LEFT twice to (3,1) and then maybe back? No—wait you can't go back on y=1.

Wait no—after reaching (5,1), moving left twice from x=5 would bring me to (3,1). But I need to end at (3,0). So that's not helpful.

Thus, Plan 3 and Plan 5 are the shortest ones with five moves each. But wait in Plan 3, it ends at (3,0); but if I could somehow reach a lower y-coordinate earlier on without moving right or left too much, maybe I can do better? Let me see.

Wait another Idea: Perhaps going beyond x=4 and then backtracking?

But that might not help. For example:

Plan 9:

Start at (5,4):

1. LEFT to (4,4)
2. DOWN twice:
   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)
3. LEFT twice to x=3 → (3,0).

That's four moves—wait:

Wait step 1: Left to 4,4.

Steps 2a-d: three downs, but in total steps 4.

Then from (4,0): LEFT twice → (2,0). No good. So that ends at x=2, y=0—not helpful.

Alternatively, after being at (4,0), moving LEFT once to (3,0)—so plan:

Plan 10:

Start at (5,4):

1. Step1: LEFT → (4,4)
2. Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)
3. Step5a: LEFT once → (3,0).

That's five moves—same as before.

But in this plan, it ends at (3,0), so yes.

Thus, I think that the minimal number of moves is five to reach (3,0). But wait earlier, when I was considering y=1, x=2, I thought maybe Plan 6 could end there with four steps. Let me recount:

Plan 6:

Start at (5,4):

1. Step1: LEFT → (4,4)
2. Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)
3. From (4,0): LEFT twice → x=2, y=0.

Thus, four moves—ends at (2,0). So if I can find a way to reach (2,1), that could be done in five steps:

Plan 7:

1. Step1: LEFT to (4,4)
2. Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)
3. From (4,0), LEFT once → (3,0). Not helpful.

Alternatively:

Plan 8: Starting at (5,4):

Step1: LEFT to (4,4)

Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)

From (5,0): RIGHT twice to x=7 → ends at (7,0). Not helpful.

Alternatively:

Plan 9: Starting at (5,4):

Step1: LEFT to (4,4)

Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)

From (5,0): LEFT twice to x=3 → (3,0). Same as Plan 3.

So I think the minimal number of moves is five. But wait, let me check another plan:

Plan 10: Starting at (5,4):

Step1: LEFT→(4,4)

Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:
   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)

From (5,0): LEFT once → (4,0). Not helpful.

So in this case, I have to end at (3,0), taking five moves.

But earlier, when I considered starting from (5,4):

Step1: LEFT→(4,4)

Steps 2a-d: DOWN three times:

   a. (4,3) → H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2) → H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1) → H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0) → H=(5,0)

From (5,0): LEFT twice → x=3, y=0.

Yes, that's five moves.

But wait earlier when I thought of ending at (2,1), maybe taking four steps:

Plan 6: Same as before but ends at (2,0). So if from (4,0) moving left once, you get to (3,0)—the same as Plan 3 and 5.

So minimal number is five moves. Thus, the answer should be \boxed{5}.

Wait, but let me double-check:

In Plan 5, I have five steps: starting at step1 to (4,4), then three downs, then one left. So that's six actions? Wait no—the notation was step-by-step instructions, so in terms of the path taken, each movement is a separate instruction.

Wait let me clarify:

Each "Step 1", "Steps 2a-d", etc., correspond to specific actions, which are moves on the grid. So from (5,4):

Step1: LEFT → (4,4)

Then Steps 2a-d: three DOWNs:
   a. (4,3) → H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2) → H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1) → H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0) → H=(5,0)

Then Step5a: LEFT → (3,0).

So that's six steps? Wait no, because after the five actions, you have finished.

Wait no—let me recount:

Step1: LEFT

Steps 2a-d: three DOWNs.

Step5a: LEFT.

That is, in terms of number of instructions, it is one step for moving left once. So total steps are six? Or am I miscounting?

Alternatively, perhaps the plan is considered as five moves because after the starting point (5,4):

1. Move Left
2. Move Down 3 times
3. Move Left

So that's four directions: LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT.

But when you're at each step, that would be:

Start at (5,4).

Step1: LEFT → (4,4)

Step2a-d: DOWN → (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0)

Step5a: LEFT → (3,0)

So the sequence is: (5,4)→(4,4)→(4,3)→(4,2)→(4,1)→(4,0)→(3,0).

Thus, that's six steps. So actually, total of five moves because each move (LEFT or DOWN) is considered a single instruction.

But the problem statement says "moving to cells"—so perhaps each movement is one step. Therefore, from (5,4):

Move LEFT → 1

Move DOWN →2

Move DOWN →3

Move DOWN →4

Move LEFT →5

Thus, total of five moves: steps from 0 to 5.

So yeah, that's consistent with Plan 5 being in five moves.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the starting cell as move one? But that seems unlikely since starting at (5,4), first move is moving to a neighbor.

Therefore, in terms of number of moves or steps, it's five.

But to confirm, let me try another path:

Plan 11: Starting at (5,4):

Step1: LEFT → (4,4)

Steps 2a-d: three DOWNs:

   a. (4,3)→H=(5,3)
   b. (4,2)→H=(5,2)
   c. (4,1)→H=(5,1)
   d. (4,0)→H=(5,0)

From (5,0): RIGHT → x=6

So that would end at (6,0), but not helpful.

Thus, no—so minimal number is five moves to reach (3,0).

Alternatively, Plan 6:

Start at (5,4):

1. LEFT→(4,4)
2. DOWN→(4,3)
3. DOWN→(4,2)
4. DOWN→(4,1)
5. LEFT→(3,1)

And then if I can go back up to (3,0)—but that would require moving UP once from (3,1), which is not allowed because you cannot move back on the same step unless it's a different direction.

Wait no—it’s only moving in directions specified by the problem. The problem allows movement only Left and Down. So you can’t move Up or Right. Therefore, after being at (4,0), all further moves must be LEFT or DOWN. Thus, to get back up from y=1 to y=0 requires a UP move, which is not permitted.

Therefore, that path ends at (3,1). Not helpful for our target of (3,0).

So the minimal number of steps seems indeed five. Hence, I think the answer is \boxed{5}.

**Final Answer**
The minimum number of moves required to reach cell $(3,0)$ is \boxed{5}.
</think>

To determine the minimum number of moves required to reach the cell (3, 0) starting from (5, 4), we can break down the problem into a series of moves that involve moving left and down.

1. Starting at (5, 4):
   - Step 1: Move LEFT to (4, 4)
2. Moving down:
   - Steps 2a-d: From (4, 4) move DOWN three times.
     - Step 2a: Move DOWN to (4, 3)
     - Step 2b: Move DOWN to (4, 2)
     - Step 2c: Move DOWN to (4, 1)
     - Step 2d: Move DOWN to (4, 0)
3. From (4, 0):
   - Step 5a: Move LEFT once to reach (3, 0)

This sequence of moves takes a total of five steps:
- Starting at (5, 4), moving left, then down three times, and finally left again.

Thus, the minimum number of moves required to reach cell (3, 0) is \boxed{5}.

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 4) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat the apple at (3, 0).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
