========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>We are given a Snake game scenario with grid 10x10 coordinates from bottom left to top right, and initial snake position head at (2,9). Current direction: LEFT. There is one body cell at coordinate (3,9) for the snake's body segment (excluding head presumably means only tail piece? Actually description "body cells" indicates tail positions I think if we are using snake's head's adjacent segments). But note that snake can not reverse direction; current direction: LEFT so cannot move RIGHT on first move because reversing would be opposite to left. Current direction is already given: LEFT. We need to plan a safe path from (2,9) to apple at (8,9). The apple coordinate is (8,9).

Observing grid coordinates: snake head at (2,9), snake body at (3,9) means that's to the right of head? Wait careful check: The snake head is at (2,9) so the x-coordinate is 2 and y=9. Snake's body cell coordinate given: (3,9). Actually note, if current direction is left then snake's head is moving left from previous move maybe? But now it's not matter.

But wait check: The apple is at (8,9). That means we need to get from (2,9) to (8,9). But notice that the y coordinate remains same. So we want only horizontal movement if possible. But note that snake body cell (3,9) is in the direction of RIGHT from head? Let's check: From (2,9), moving right would lead to (3,9) which is currently occupied by snake's body tail because it's provided as "body cells" excluding head. So cannot move directly right immediately.

But we must plan safe moves that eventually reach apple at (8,9). But wait, what are constraints: Must not reverse direction on first move. Current direction is LEFT so you cannot choose RIGHT for the first move. We need to consider how to reach apple safely and avoid collisions with body. Possibly use an alternative route.

We can check possible directions from head (2,9): The snake's valid moves are "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". But if we move right, immediate collision because body cell is at (3,9) is in the direction of moving right. So we cannot go right on first move.

We can check other directions: If we try to go left from (2,9), then new head position would be (1,9). That might be safe? But apple is at (8,9)? Actually no, going left gets us further away from the apple. Also note the movement constraint: x coordinate difference from 2 to 8 means we need more RIGHT moves than LEFT moves overall. But if we move left now then count will be negative direction. But maybe a detour route is required.

We might consider an alternate route that avoids immediate collision with body cell. The snake's body segment at (3,9) suggests it occupies the square in front of our head if going right? Wait check: If snake is facing LEFT and its current position is head (2,9), then if we choose move RIGHT, new head would be (3,9) which is occupied by the snake's body cell. So cannot pick that.

Maybe we can go up first to avoid collision? But note, apple at (8,9) shares same y coordinate as head. And moving UP from (2,9) gives us (2,10). But grid is 0-indexed with max y=9 so (2,10) would be outside grid because grid bounds are x in [0,9] and y in [0,9]. So UP is not possible if it goes off-grid. Check: Grid coordinates from bottom left (0,0) to top right (9,9). With head at (2,9), UP means new position (2,10) which is outside the grid. Similarly DOWN move: from (2,9) would be (2,8) and that might be safe because y=8 is within bounds.

What about moving left? That gives new head = (1,9). But does that cause collision with body? Body cell at (3,9) is not on that square. So left is allowed if it doesn't violate snake rule "cannot reverse direction"? Wait check constraint: "Must not reverse direction on the first move." The snake's current direction is LEFT. Reversing means if currently moving left then you cannot go right next? Let me re-read the rule exactly: "* Must not reverse direction on the first move." That means we must not choose a move that would be opposite to the previous direction? But here the "current direction" was given as LEFT so if we try to move RIGHT, that is opposite of left. And our analysis already said right from (2,9) leads to collision with body. So anyway it's illegal.

So options available: UP and DOWN and LEFT are possible moves? Let's check all:
- UP: new head = (2,10). But grid y goes up to 9, so that's out-of-bound.
- RIGHT: (3,9) but snake body cell occupies that square. So not allowed.
- DOWN: (2,8) safe because it's within grid and doesn't collide with snake body? Check snake body is at (3,9). And head moves to (2,8), so no collision with snake's body since snake's body is at a different coordinate. But wait: check potential wall collisions? But (2,8) is valid.

- LEFT: (1,9) safe as long as not colliding with snake's body cell. Snake body cell is at (3,9). So that's allowed.

But we must be careful because if we choose left then our net horizontal difference becomes negative relative to apple? But we can always plan a later correction route as the problem states: "final position check" means overall counts of moves must sum up exactly. The required final displacement is x difference 6 (8-2) and y difference 0. So if we go left once, then you'll have to eventually offset that with two right moves? Wait compute: If I move LEFT one time, then my relative position becomes (-1,0). To achieve net +6 in x, you would need an additional difference of +7 in x direction (or rather, because final displacement from initial head must be exactly RIGHT difference 6 minus left difference. Let's denote total right moves = R and left moves = L. We require R - L = 6. If we have a preliminary move left (L=1) then R-L = R-1 should equal 6 => R=7. So the number of right moves must be exactly 7 to compensate for one left move.

But is that route safe? Let's check possible path: The apple at (8,9) means eventually we want to be horizontal coordinate 8 when y remains same as head's y coordinate which is 9 if we do not change vertical displacement. But then the snake's body cell is at (3,9). And if we go right from head while it's on same row, you'll have collision with the body segment if your tail hasn't moved.

Maybe a detour route that avoids going directly right when the tail occupies that square? Let’s check: The snake current state:
Head: (2,9)
Body: [(3,9)]
Apple: (8,9)

Now note: Snake's head is at (2,9), and its body extends to (3,9). If we move RIGHT from head we would be going into the square that currently contains body. But if apple is at (8,9) then eventually you'll need to move right along row y=9. But you can't because snake's body will block it immediately.

Thus maybe a detour upward or downward might be needed so that when moving right, the path is clear because the body moves forward and leaves behind a gap? Let’s simulate snake movement in time step manner with current configuration:

At t=0 (initial state):
Head: (2,9)
Body: (3,9) [immediately behind head]
Apple at (8,9)

After each move, snake's new head becomes old head + direction. The tail is removed if apple not eaten.

Consider potential moves:
Option 1: Move DOWN from (2,9) → new head = (2,8). Then snake body will update: previous head becomes part of the body? Let’s simulate snake movement step by step:

State before move: 
Head = (2,9)
Body = [ (3,9)]
Apple at (8,9)

If we choose DOWN:
- New head becomes (2,9) + (0,-1) = (2,8).
- The previous head (2,9) is added to body.
- Tail removed: but apple not eaten so tail gets removed from snake's old body. But the snake's body currently has only one segment (3,9). So after move:
New state t=1:
Head: (2,8)
Body becomes: [ (2,9), (3,9) ] with older positions if any? Actually wait: When moving, new head is added to front of the snake, then tail removed. But careful: The simulation:
- Snake's position is a sequence of segments from head to tail in order of movement. At initial state, we have head and body segments behind it. For clarity, I'll denote snake segments as positions with head at index 0 and tail at last index.
At t=0, snake segments [ (2,9), (3,9) ].
Now if we move DOWN:
- new head: (2,8).
- The previous head becomes second element of the snake body. So new snake becomes [ (2,8), (2,9), (3,9) ]
But then tail removed: so remove last segment (3,9). Wait that's ambiguous because if no apple eaten, typically tail is removed, but here the snake grows if apple eaten. But not eaten in this move. So new snake becomes [ (2,8), (2,9) ].
But check constraints: It says "After eating the apple, avoid traps—ensure there's at least one legal move afterward." Not relevant now.

So after moving down:
Snake becomes: Head = (2,8), Body = [ (2,9) ]
Apple remains at (8,9).

Now from position (2,8), what moves are possible?
We want to eventually go right along row 9? But then we might need to rejoin the same y coordinate. However, if we move right immediately from (2,8)? That gives new head = (3,8). And snake body is at (2,9) and apple remains at (8,9). Is that safe? Possibly yes.
But wait: We must check not reversing direction rule: The previous direction was LEFT? Wait current direction is initially LEFT? Actually the snake's "current direction" given in input is LEFT. But if we choose DOWN as first move, then are we allowed to choose any direction because it says "if direction is NONE, any move is allowed"? No, that only applies when previous direction equals NONE. So now current direction after a move becomes the move you just moved? Possibly yes. In snake game typically the next move's constraint is "cannot reverse" relative to the direction of movement (which was the last chosen direction). But here it says: "Must not reverse direction on the first move". I think that means we are not allowed to choose a move that is exactly opposite to current head's direction. Since our previous head's direction was LEFT, then RIGHT is forbidden as the next move because it is reverse of left. But now after moving down, the snake's "current direction" becomes DOWN? Wait, check: "Current direction: LEFT — One of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or NONE." That means if the snake's current motion is LEFT, then on the first move, we cannot choose a move that would be opposite to left. But wait, what does "first move" exactly mean? It probably means initial move from given state where head is (2,9) and direction is LEFT. So for our first move, if we choose down, it's allowed because it's not reverse of left. But then after we've moved, the snake's new current direction becomes whichever move you just made, I assume.

So if I choose DOWN as first move, then current direction becomes DOWN. Then subsequent moves must not be opposite of that direction (which is UP) on their immediate next step. So we have to plan safe moves in sequence with that constraint.

But let’s check alternative: Option 2: Move LEFT from (2,9)? That gives head = (1,9). But then snake body becomes: [ (2,9), (3,9) ] and tail removed so final state becomes [ (1,9), (2,9) ]. Then current direction would become LEFT. But then apple is at (8,9) but now the snake is further left away from it horizontally. It might be possible to eventually go right later. But careful: The net displacement required in x must sum up to 6 extra right moves minus left moves equals +6. If we do one left move, then we need seven right moves total. Also check potential collision risk: when moving right along row 9, if snake's body segment is in the way, might be safe because that tail might have moved.

Let's simulate Option 2: Move LEFT first:
State at t=0:
Head (2,9), Body (3,9)
After move LEFT:
New head becomes (1,9) [valid]
Snake becomes new snake segments: Head = (1,9), then previous head becomes body segment: now snake's list: [ (1,9), (2,9) ]. And tail removed from behind, so now (3,9) is lost.
Now apple at (8,9).

Next move possibilities:
From state: Head (1,9), Body = [(2,9)]. The net displacement needed to get to (8,9) is x difference 7 and y difference 0. But wait, careful: final required relative horizontal movement should be R - L =? Actually if we are at (1,9) after first move, the apple is at (8,9). So net horizontal difference is +7. And vertical difference remains 0. Now what moves are possible?
We can try to go RIGHT from here: new head becomes (2,9), but that's exactly where the body currently is. That would cause collision because snake's body occupies (2,9).
So cannot move right immediately.

What about moving LEFT? New head = (0,9). Then snake becomes [ (0,9), (1,9) ]. And then apple remains at (8,9). But that increases left moves further. That doesn't help.
Maybe try moving up or down to avoid collision along the same row?
Let's test: from state after Option 2 move LEFT:
Head = (1,9), Body = [ (2,9) ].

Option: move UP: new head becomes (1,10). But check grid boundaries? y=10 is out-of-bound if maximum y coordinate is 9. So not allowed.
Move DOWN: new head becomes (1,8). That is allowed because snake's body is at (2,9) which is different from (1,8).
After move:
New state: Head = (1,8), Body becomes [ (1,9), (2,9) ]? Let's simulate properly:
At t=0 after first move we had snake: [(1,9), (2,9)].
Move DOWN: new head becomes (1,9) + (0,-1) = (1,8). But wait, that would be (1,8)? Actually check: (1,9) down means y coordinate decreases by 1 → (1,8).
Then add old head to body. So snake becomes [ (1,8), (1,9), (2,9)] and then tail removed yields [ (1,8), (1,9) ].
But note that (1,9) now is both head's previous position which might be same as apple? Wait, apple remains at (8,9). So still okay.

Then from state: Head = (1,8), Body = [(1,9)]. Now if we move right, new head becomes (2,8). That seems safe because body at (1,9) is not on that square.
Now then subsequent moves might eventually allow to get back onto row 9 and approach apple? But the apple is at (8,9), so you want to eventually have y coordinate equal to 9. Possibly plan a path that gets around the snake's body collision.

Let’s try Option 1: Move DOWN first from (2,9) then right? Let’s simulate further:
Starting state Option 1: From initial state if we choose DOWN.
t=0 initial: [ (2,9), (3,9) ] with apple at (8,9).
After move DOWN:
New head = (2,8)
Snake becomes: Head = (2,8), then previous head (2,9) appended as second segment, and tail removed. But we must check the order carefully.

Actually, let’s do simulation clearly:

We have snake segments represented in order of movement: [Head, Body1, Body2, ...]. Initially:
Segments0: Head = A(2,9), Segments1: B(3,9).

Now if moving down means adding (0,-1) to head:
New head = (2,9 + (-1))? Actually (2,9) + (0,-1) = (2,8). So new segments become:
[ (2,8), old head becomes (2,9), and then tail removed from the back of snake. But note that the snake always moves as a whole: the new head is added at front, and the last segment is removed.
So new snake becomes: [ (2,8), (2,9) ] because B(3,9) gets removed.
So t=1: Head = (2,8); Body = (2,9).

Now possible moves from state t=1:
Current direction now becomes DOWN (since we moved down). So next move cannot be UP.
We want to eventually reach apple at (8,9). What is our plan? We need to get horizontally right and then adjust vertical coordinate.

Let's try: Move RIGHT from (2,8) → new head = (3,8). But check collision: body is (2,9), which is not colliding with (3,8). So that move seems safe.
After move RIGHT:
Simulate snake movement at t=1:
Snake segments currently: [Head=(2,8), Body=(2,9)].
Moving right adds new head = (2,8) + (1,0) = (3,8).
Then old head becomes body segment. So temporarily: Snake becomes [ (3,8), (2,8), (2,9) ] and then remove tail => removal of last segment, which is (2,9). So new snake becomes: [ (3,8), (2,8)].
Now state t=2:
Head = (3,8); Body = (2,8).
Current direction now becomes RIGHT.

From state t=2, apple remains at (8,9) and our snake is at row 8 in columns 3,2. 
We need to eventually get to row 9 (because apple's y coordinate is 9). But note that if we move right along the same row (row 8), we'll be moving horizontally with no vertical change.
But what about the snake body? It's at (2,8) which would not interfere if we try to go further right because they are behind us. But careful: The apple is at (8,9). To get to that coordinate, you need to have y=9 eventually.

So from state t=2, possible moves: We can move up to row 7 maybe then later move down? Let's think:
We want final state: Head must be at (8,9) and the net horizontal difference is R - L = ? Actually, if we go further right along row 8, you'll eventually reach column 8 if possible but then need to change y coordinate. But maybe it's simpler to move down after reaching a safe position on row 8, then turn up onto row 9.
But wait: the snake is currently at (3,8) and body = (2,8). The apple is at (8,9), so we want to eventually get from row 8 to row 9. But if I move down from (3,8): new head becomes (3,7). That doesn't help because then you'll be further away vertically.
Maybe the strategy: From state t=2, continue moving right until safe turning point? Let's try continuing to move right.

At t=2:
Snake: Head = (3,8); Body = (2,8).

If we move RIGHT again at t=2:
New head becomes (4,8).
Simulation:
Before move: [ (3,8), (2,8) ]
After adding new head: temporary list [ (4,8), (3,8), (2,8) ], then remove tail → removes (2,8). New snake becomes: [ (4,8), (3,8)].
State t=3:
Head = (4,8); Body = (3,8).
Current direction becomes RIGHT.

Now if we move RIGHT again at t=3:
New head = (5,8)
Then new snake becomes: after moving right from state [ (4,8), (3,8) ]: temporary list [ (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) ], then remove tail → removes (3,8). New snake becomes: [ (5,8), (4,8)].
State t=4:
Head = (5,8); Body = (4,8).
Current direction remains RIGHT.

Then move RIGHT again at t=4:
New head becomes (6,8)
After moving right: temporary list [ (6,8), (5,8), (4,8) ], remove tail → new snake becomes: [ (6,8), (5,8)].
State t=5:
Head = (6,8); Body = (5,8).

Then move RIGHT again at t=5:
New head becomes (7,8)
After moving right: temporary list [ (7,8), (6,8), (5,8) ], remove tail → new snake becomes: [ (7,8), (6,8)].
State t=6:
Head = (7,8); Body = (6,8).

Now we are at state t=6. The apple is still at (8,9). We want to eventually get there.
Maybe now turn up? But note: If I move up from (7,8) then new head becomes (7,9), which might be safe if not colliding with snake body. At t=6, snake segments are [ (7,8), (6,8)]. 
But caution: The apple is at (8,9). And note that if I move up from (7,8) then new head becomes (7,9). But then my body remains as [ (7,8), (6,8)].
Now after that, can I move right? From (7,9), moving right gives (8,9) which is the apple. That seems promising.

So next step from state t=6: Move UP.
From (7,8): new head = (7,9).
Simulate:
State t=6 snake: [Head=(7,8), Body=(6,8)].
Moving up means adding vector (0,+1):
New head becomes (7,8+? Actually careful: up means y coordinate increases by 1)
(7,8) + (0, +1) = (7,9).
Temporary list: [ (7,9), (7,8), (6,8) ], then remove tail → new snake becomes: [ (7,9), (7,8)].
State t=7:
Head = (7,9); Body = (7,8). Current direction becomes UP.

Now from state t=7, if I move RIGHT:
New head becomes (8,9) which is the apple.
Simulate moving right from state [ (7,9), (7,8) ]:
Temporary list: [ (8,9), (7,9), (7,8) ], then remove tail → new snake becomes: [ (8,9), (7,9)].
State t=8:
Head = (8,9); Body = (7,9).
We reached the apple.

So Option 1 yields a valid path sequence. The moves we took: First move: DOWN from initial state.
Then move RIGHT several times until reaching column 7, then UP then RIGHT to get apple at (8,9).

Let's write down the sequence of moves in order:
Start at (2,9) with snake = [(2,9), (3,9)].
Move 1: Down → new head becomes (2,8). Snake becomes: [(2,8), (2,9)].
Move 2: Right → new head becomes (3,8). Snake becomes: [(3,8), (2,8)].
Move 3: Right → new head becomes (4,8). Snake becomes: [(4,8), (3,8)].
Move 4: Right → new head becomes (5,8). Snake becomes: [(5,8), (4,8)].
Move 5: Right → new head becomes (6,8). Snake becomes: [(6,8), (5,8)].
Move 6: Right → new head becomes (7,8). Snake becomes: [(7,8), (6,8)].
Move 7: Up → new head becomes (7,9). Snake becomes: [(7,9), (7,8)].
Move 8: Right → new head becomes (8,9) → apple.

Thus, the answer is a sequence of moves: D, R, R, R, R, R, U, R. Let me check if any collisions occur:
- After move1, snake occupies cells: (2,8), (2,9). No collision.
- Move2: new head at (3,8) while body is (2,8), so that's safe as long as (3,8) != (2,8).
- And so on. All good.

We can also check alternative possibility Option 1 with Down first from initial state. But our simulation produced a valid path. 

I want to double-check: Starting snake is [A=(2,9), B=(3,9)]. Apple at (8,9). If I move DOWN:
- new head = A + (0,-1) = (2,8).
- snake becomes [ (2,8), (2,9) ].
Then if I move RIGHT from (2,8):
- new head becomes (3,8).
- snake becomes [ (3,8), (2,8) ].
Then moving RIGHT repeatedly:
- t=3: HEAD = (4,8); snake becomes [ (4,8), (3,8) ]
- t=4: HEAD = (5,8); snake becomes [ (5,8), (4,8) ]
- t=5: HEAD = (6,8); snake becomes [ (6,8), (5,8) ]
- t=6: HEAD = (7,8); snake becomes [ (7,8), (6,8) ].
Then move UP from (7,8): new head becomes (7,9).
- snake becomes [ (7,9), (7,8) ].
Then move RIGHT from (7,9): new head becomes (8,9).
- snake becomes [ (8,9), (7,9) ].

Thus it's valid. The moves are exactly D then R repeated 6 times? Wait, let me count: After initial down, we did Right moves:
From state after move1, positions column=2 to column=3 is one move. Then further right moves: columns 4,5,6,7 - so that's total of 5 more moves? Let's recount:

After move1, snake head = (2,8).
Move2: Right → head becomes (3,8). (Column 3)
Move3: Right → head becomes (4,8) (Column 4)
Move4: Right → head becomes (5,8) (Column 5)
Move5: Right → head becomes (6,8) (Column 6)
Move6: Right → head becomes (7,8) (Column 7)

That is 1 (initial down) + 6 moves right? Wait, I need to count the number of moves:
I started at state0 with snake.
Moves:
1. Down from (2,9) -> (2,8)
2. Right -> (3,8)
3. Right -> (4,8)
4. Right -> (5,8)
5. Right -> (6,8)
6. Right -> (7,8)
7. Up -> (7,9)
8. Right -> (8,9)

That's 8 moves.

Thus the answer is: D, R, R, R, R, R, U, R. Alternatively, one might express it as "Down, then 5 rights" but careful counting:
From (2,8) to (7,8) requires 5 right moves because starting at column2 and ending at column7 means difference of 5.
Let's recalc: if you are in column 2 then move Right yields column3. Then Right gives col4, etc. Let me count precisely:
Initial head position after down is (2,8) which has x=2. To get to apple at (8,9), we want x coordinate 7 before the final right move? Actually, let’s recalc: We want eventually to be at (7,9) so that a right gives (8,9). So if we need head = (7,9) then from row 8 to row 9, we must have been in same column. Wait our simulation:
After move6, snake head was (7,8), and then move up gave (7,9). Then right gave apple at (8,9). So that means from initial down, you want to get from x=2 (after first move) to x=7 with consecutive rights. That is 5 moves: 
2 -> 3 (1st R)
3 -> 4 (2nd R)
4 -> 5 (3rd R)
5 -> 6 (4th R)
6 -> 7 (5th R)

So the sequence is: D, then five R's in a row, then U, then R. That totals moves: 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 8 moves.

Let me check collision after each move:
After initial down: snake positions: (2,8), (2,9). No collision.
After first right: head becomes (3,8); body remains (2,8) and (2,9) except tail removed. So new snake is [(3,8), (2,8)]. Not colliding.
Then second right: head becomes (4,8); body = (3,8) from previous head plus old body (2,8)? But then after each move, the tail falls off. At each stage, no overlap because the snake is moving in a straight line and the body follows behind exactly one step. And because we are not turning back into our own path? Actually, it's safe as long as we don't make a U-turn immediately.

Yes, that seems valid.

Now I'll check alternative possibility Option 1: Could we have moved right first? Starting from (2,9), if you move right then head becomes (3,9) but then body is (3,9) which would be collision. So not allowed.

Could we have moved up initially? From (2,9), moving up gives (2,10) which might be out-of-bound if grid is 9 rows maximum.
What about left? That would get you off apple's x coordinate direction. Not likely.

Thus the sequence D then multiple rights then U then R seems plausible.

I need to output a path as sequence of moves: Down, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Up, Right.

So answer: D, R, R, R, R, R, U, R.

But let me double-check the relative positions:
Initial snake: head at (2,9), body at (3,9). Apple is at (8,9).
- If we go down from head: new head at (2,8) but apple's x coordinate 8 and y coordinate 9. So that seems like a detour.
But wait, if we are going to eventually get to (7,9), then final move right gets us to (8,9). That works.

I should also check if there's any possibility of collision when turning upward from (7,8) to (7,9)? The snake's body is at (7,8) after the last right. But wait, careful: After move6, snake head = (7,8), and what are the tail positions? Let's simulate step by step:

Initial state:
Position A (head): (2,9)
Position B (body): (3,9)

Move 1: Down
- new head becomes (2,8).
Now snake becomes: [(2,8) as head, then old head becomes second segment, but then tail falls off? Actually how snake movement works: new position = old head + move, and then add that to front. The last segment is removed. So after each move:
After move1: 
New head = (2,9) + Down => (2,8). 
Old head becomes second cell.
So snake now occupies: [(2,8), (2,9)].

Move 2: Right
- new head = (2,8) + Right => (3,8).
Then snake becomes: [(3,8), (2,8)], because the previous tail (which was at (2,9)) gets dropped. So now occupies positions (3,8) and (2,8).

Move 3: Right
- new head = (3,8) + Right => (4,8).
Then snake becomes: [(4,8), (3,8)].

Move 4: Right
- new head = (4,8) + Right => (5,8).
Then snake becomes: [(5,8), (4,8)].

Move 5: Right
- new head = (5,8) + Right => (6,8).
Snake becomes: [(6,8), (5,8)].

Move 6: Right
- new head = (6,8) + Right => (7,8).
Then snake becomes: [(7,8), (6,8)].
Now here's potential issue: The body that was at (7,8) might be there from previous move if not careful. Let's check:
After move5, snake was [(6,8), (5,8)]. So after move6, the new head becomes (7,8). But wait, isn't that cell occupied by our old tail? Actually, no: After move5, snake positions were at (6,8) and (5,8). Then we add a segment at (7,8) as head. And then remove the tail which is at (5,8). So now snake occupies [(7,8), (6,8)]. That's fine.

Move 7: Up from (7,8):
- new head = (7,8) + Up => (7,9).
Snake becomes: [(7,9), (7,8)].
Now check collision: The body is at (7,8) which is immediately below the head. That's allowed.

Move 8: Right from (7,9):
- new head = (7,9) + Right => (8,9).
Snake becomes: [(8,9), (7,9)].
That's exactly the apple location.

So it works fine.

Thus answer is valid.

Therefore, answer with moves: Down, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Up, Right.

I will now produce a final answer message accordingly.</think>We can solve this problem by “routing” our snake so that after a few moves its head reaches the apple without running into itself. One valid solution is as follows:

Initial snake:
 Head: (2,9)
 Body: (3,9)

Apple at: (8,9)

A possible move sequence is:

1. Move Down from (2,9) to (2,8).
 Now the snake occupies (2,8) and (2,9).

2. Move Right from (2,8) to (3,8).
 Snake now: [(3,8), (2,8)].

3. Move Right from (3,8) to (4,8).
 Snake becomes: [(4,8), (3,8)].

4. Move Right from (4,8) to (5,8).
 Snake becomes: [(5,8), (4,8)].

5. Move Right from (5,8) to (6,8).
 Snake becomes: [(6,8), (5,8)].

6. Move Right from (6,8) to (7,8).
 Snake becomes: [(7,8), (6,8)].

7. Now move Up from (7,8) to (7,9).
 Snake becomes: [(7,9), (7,8)].
 (Notice the head is now directly left of the apple.)

8. Finally, move Right from (7,9) to (8,9) and reach the apple.
 Final snake: [(8,9), (7,9)].

At every step the snake avoids colliding with itself because it’s simply “growing” one cell in front while dropping its tail, and our turns are arranged so that no segment is overwritten.

Thus, one correct sequence of moves is:

Down, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Up, Right

This path safely guides the snake from (2,9) to (8,9).
