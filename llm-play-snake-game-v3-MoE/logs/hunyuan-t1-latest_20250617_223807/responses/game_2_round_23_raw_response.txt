{
"moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (1,0) with a long body along the bottom, right, and top edges. To reach the apple at (0,5), the snake needs to move left (to x=0) and up (to y=5). Moving LEFT first avoids body collisions and positions the head at (0,0). Subsequent UP moves navigate up the left edge, avoiding the snake's body which shifts upward each turn. This path ensures no collisions with walls or body segments and leaves space to continue moving after eating the apple."
