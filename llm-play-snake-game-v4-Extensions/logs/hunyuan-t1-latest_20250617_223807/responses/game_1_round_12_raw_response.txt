{
"moves": ["DOWN", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,2) with a vertical body along x=4 (y=2-9). To reach the apple at (3,3), the snake must move left 2 and up 1. Direct left from (5,2) collides with the body, so the snake first moves DOWN to (5,1), then LEFT to (4,1) (avoiding body), then UP three times: (4,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) (reaching the apple). This path avoids collisions and leaves legal moves (UP/LEFT) after eating."
