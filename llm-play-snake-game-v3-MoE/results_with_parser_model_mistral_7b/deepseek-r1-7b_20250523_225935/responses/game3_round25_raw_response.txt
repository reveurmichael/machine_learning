========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out a path for the snake's head from (5,9) to (2,4) without colliding with itself. The snake currently has its body at [(5,8), (6,8)], which means it looks like this: Head is at (5,9), then followed by (5,8) and (6,8). So the next move can't make any part of the snake hit another part except possibly when eating the apple.

First, let's plot out where the apple is. The apple is at (2,4). From (5,9), I need to go left towards 2 and down a lot towards 4. That means moving left by 3 units and down by 5 units. So, I'll probably need more lefts than rights and more downs than ups.

But wait, the snake can't reverse direction on the first move if it's not NONE initially. The current direction is UP, so after that, maybe we should consider changing to other directions like LEFT or RIGHT.

Let me think about possible moves step by step. Since the initial position of the head is (5,9), moving right would take it to (6,9) but the body has a segment at (6,8). So if I move right, the new head would be (6,9). The next positions in the body are (6,8), which is adjacent. But since the snake's length is 3 (head + two body parts), moving right might cause it to hit its own tail? Wait, no, because when you move right, the old head becomes the new second segment.

Wait, let me clarify. The initial snake is [(5,9), (5,8), (6,8)]. If I move RIGHT, the head would be at (6,9). Then, the body shifts: first, insert the old head into the front, so the new body becomes [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)]. But then, since it's not eating the apple, we remove the tail. So the snake after move would be [(6,9), (5,9)].

Wait no, according to the rules: if you don't eat the apple, you remove the tail. So when moving right:

1. New head is (6,9).
2. Check collision: is it outside grid? No.
3. Then update body:
   a. Insert old head at front: [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)].
   b. Remove tail since not eating apple: becomes [(6,9), (5,9)].

Wait no, the initial body is [(5,8), (6,8)], so when you move right:

- New head is at (6,9). Check if it's in any of the current body except the new tail. Current body after inserting old head would be [new_head, old_head, old_body1]. So before removing the tail, check if new head collides with any body except when the tail moves.

In this case, moving right to (6,9), which is not in the initial body positions [(5,8), (6,8)]. Because after inserting, it would be [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)], but before removing the tail. So then we remove the last element because not eating apple.

Wait no, let me step through this correctly:

Current snake is [Head=(5,9), Body1=(5,8), Body2=(6,8)].

Moving right to new_head=(6,9).

Check collision: (6,9) is inside grid and not in the current body except when the tail moves. Since it's moving from head (5,9) to (6,9), which isn't in the body [5,8; 6,8]. So no collision.

Then update body:

a. Insert old head at front: new_body = [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)].
b. Since not eating apple, remove last element (tail moves): new_body becomes [(6,9), (5,9)].

Wait but the current snake was of length 3; after moving and removing tail, it's now length 2? That can't be right because a snake should retain its body except when eating. So maybe I made a mistake in the step.

Actually, no: When you move without eating an apple, the body shifts by one, so the new head is added to the front, and the last tail is removed. But since it's length 3, moving right would result in:

After inserting old head at front, the body becomes [ (6,9), (5,9), (5,8) ].

But then remove the last element: so [(6,9), (5,9)] remains. Wait that reduces the snake to two segments? No, because the original body had two elements after head; adding one and removing one would make it 2 +1 -1 = 2? So no, but a snake can't have only two segments when its initial length is three.

Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:

The snake's initial body has two parts: [ (5,8), (6,8) ]. So the snake's total length is 3: head + body1 + body2.

After moving right, new_head = (6,9). Insert old head at front: body becomes [new_head, current_head]. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element. So:

New_body after inserting: [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)].
Then, since not eating apple, we remove the tail (5,8). So new_body is [(6,9), (5,9)]. But this would make snake's length 2? That can't be right because it was initially length 3.

Wait no, when you don't eat an apple, you just move forward without growing. So if the snake was of length 3 (head + two bodies), moving and removing tail keeps it at length 3-1=2?

No, that's not correct. Because in each step:

If you're not eating, you grow by one? No.

Wait the movement rules say: when you don't eat apple, remove the last element of the body. So if the snake was [H, B1, B2], moving without eating becomes [new_H, H, B1]. Then since it's not growing, we need to remove the tail (B2). So new snake is [new_H, H, B1].

Wait that can't be right either. Let me check:

Rule 3c: If no apple, body shifts by removing last element.

So for S = [H, B1, B2], moving without eating becomes [new_H, H, B1] after adding new_head to front and then removing the tail (B2).

Ah, so in this case, length remains same. So from 3 elements, it's still 3: [new_H, H, B1].

So that makes sense.

Okay, going back:

Move RIGHT to (6,9): 

- Check collision: new_head is not colliding with current body except when tail moves.
- Insert old head at front: S becomes [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)].
- Since not eating apple, remove last element: [(6,9), (5,9)].

Wait no, because original snake was [H=(5,9), B1=(5,8), B2=(6,8)]. After adding new_head at front: [new_H, H, B1]. So that's three elements. Then remove the tail which is after moving, the body would be [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)].

Wait no, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the order.

The correct update steps are:

a. Insert old head into front of the body list. So new_body becomes [new_head] + current_body.

b. If not eating apple, remove last element: new_body = new_body[:-1].

So for S initial is [(5,9), (5,8), (6,8)]:
After moving right:

a. Insert old head at front: [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (6,8)].

Wait no, the initial body list after inserting new_head would be [new_head] + current_body, which is [new_head, H, B1]. But wait, in this case:

Original S is [H=(5,9), B1=(5,8), B2=(6,8)]. So when moving right to (6,9):

a. Insert old head at front: new_body = [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (6,8)]? Wait that would be adding the head again.

Wait no, I think I'm getting this wrong because the snake's body list excludes the head. So when you add a new head to the front, you are shifting all other segments forward.

Let me see:

Original S: [H=(5,9), B1=(5,8), B2=(6,8)].

When moving right, new_head = (6,9).

Step 3a: Insert old head into body list at front. So the new_body before step 3b is [new_head, H, B1].

But wait no:

Original S has length 3: Head + Body of two segments.

So when you move right:

- Step 2: compute new_head = (6,9).

- Check collision with any existing body positions except the tail. Since current_body is [(5,8), (6,8)], and new_head=(6,9) isn't in those, so no collision.

- Then update body:

a. Insert old head into front: [new_head, H=5,9, B1=5,8].

But wait the original S is only 3 elements, which are Head, Body1, Body2.

So after inserting new_head at front, we have four elements? That can't be because each move either adds one (when eating) or keeps same length when not eating. Wait no:

When you don't eat an apple, body shifts by removing last element. So initial S has 3 elements: [H, B1, B2].

After moving right and inserting H at front: the new_body becomes [new_head] + current_body = [ (6,9), (5,9), (5,8) ].

Then step 3b: since not eating apple, remove last element of body: so [(6,9), (5,9)] remains. So now S is [H=(6,9), B1=(5,9)]. Wait that's only two elements? That can't be right because when you start with three, move and don't eat apple, shouldn't it remain the same?

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding how body list works.

Let me think again: 

The snake is represented as a list where:

- The first element is the head.
- The rest are the body parts in order from head to tail.

So when you move without eating, you add the new_head at front and remove last element of current_body. So initial S has length 3: [H=(5,9), B1=(5,8), B2=(6,8)].

After moving right:

- new_head = (6,9).

a. Insert into front: new_body_before_removal is [(6,9), H=(5,9), B1=(5,8)].

b. Then remove last element (B1) because not eating apple: new_body becomes [ (6,9), (5,9) ].

So now the snake has two segments? That can't be correct because it was three before. Wait no:

Wait initial S had 3 elements. After moving and inserting at front, you have 4 elements. Then remove last element to get back to 3?

No, let me rephrase.

Wait when you move without eating an apple, the body shifts forward by one (i.e., all segments except the tail are shifted). So initial S is [H, B1, B2]. After moving right:

a. Insert H into front: new_body is [new_head, H, B1].

b. Then remove last element to get [new_head, H], so now body has two elements.

But that reduces the snake's length from 3 to 2? That can't be correct because snakes shouldn't lose a segment when not eating unless it's about collision.

Wait maybe I'm getting confused with how the body list is handled. Let me see: in step 3a, you insert new_head at front of current_body (which is [H, B1, B2]). So that becomes [new_head, H, B1]. Then, since not eating apple, remove last element to get [new_head, H], which has two elements.

But the snake's body should have all segments except for when it eats. If you start with three and move without eating, shouldn't it still be at length 3? Or is this a misunderstanding?

Wait looking back at rule 3:

When not eating apple: 

a. Insert new_head into front of body.

b. Remove last element (tail).

So initial S has 2 segments (head + one body part). After moving, you insert head and remove tail. So same length.

But in our case, the snake is longer because it had two bodies after head.

Wait perhaps for a snake with N segments:

Moving forward without eating: new_head is added at front, last element removed. So from 3 to 2? That seems odd unless the initial body has only one segment.

I think I'm making this more complicated than necessary. Maybe let's not focus on that and instead try to plan a path towards the apple by considering the possible directions step by step.

We need to move left (to reduce x from 5 to 2) and down (to increase y from 9 to 4). So perhaps we can alternate between LEFT, DOWN, etc., while avoiding any collision with itself or its body.

Also, note that when moving, the new head must not be adjacent to any existing body except for the one it will become after the update. So maybe some moves would cause adjacency issues if done too quickly.

Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Current position: (5,9), facing UP.
2. We need to move towards lower y and higher negative x.

But initial direction is UP; moving forward from UP will take us further up, which is away from the apple's y=4. So that's bad. Maybe turning around first.

Wait no, because if we face a different direction after some moves.

So perhaps step 1: change direction to LEFT so we can start moving towards lower x.

But let me think through each move carefully:

Move 1:

Current head is (5,9), facing UP.

Option 1: Turn left (now facing LEFT).

New_head = (4,9). 

Check collision with existing body. Current body is [(5,8), (6,8)]. So new_head=(4,9) isn't in that list; so no collision.

Update body:

a. Insert old head at front: [ (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (6,8) ]? Wait initial snake is of length 3: H=(5,9), B1=(5,8), B2=(6,8). After moving and inserting new_head at front, it's four elements. Then remove last element because not eating apple.

Wait that would make the body [ (4,9), (5,9) ] again? That seems incorrect in terms of length, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps when you insert new_head into front, and then if you're moving without growing, you remove only one segment. So initial S has 3 elements: H, B1, B2. After inserting at front, it's [new_H, H, B1]. Then since not eating apple, removing the last element (B1), so new snake is [new_H, H].

So from length 3 to 2? That seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps when you move and don't eat apple, the body shifts by one. So initial S of length N becomes length N-1 after a forward movement because you add one at front but remove one at end. Wait that would mean:

Initial: [H, B1, B2].

After moving without eating:

new_body = new_H + current_body except last.

So for example, if body is [(5,8), (6,8)], after inserting H=(4,9) at front and removing the tail of the previous snake? Wait this is getting confusing again.

Maybe I should think in terms of steps more carefully.

Let me try to outline each movement step with specific details:

Current state:
- Head: (5,9)
- Body: [(5,8), (6,8)]
- Direction: UP
- No apple eaten yet

Move 1: Facing UP, moving would take head to (5,10) which is outside the grid. So not possible.

Thus, facing UP can't be used as it leads out of the grid when moved.

So perhaps change direction first before moving:

Option A: Change direction from UP to LEFT.

Then move forward in that new direction.

Step 1:

Current head = (5,9). Direction changes to LEFT. So next movement would take us to (4,9).

Check if this is a valid position:
- Is (4,9) inside grid? Yes.
- Is it adjacent to any current body except when the tail moves?

Wait, wait: When moving without eating apple:

After adding new_head at front and removing last element of previous_body.

So initial S has [H=(5,9), B1=(5,8), B2=(6,8)].

Move LEFT:
- new_head = (4,9).

Insert into front: body becomes [(4,9), H=(5,9), B1=(5,8)]. Then remove last element because not eating apple: body is now [(4,9), (5,9)].

Thus the snake's head moves to (4,9), body is [(5,9)], which seems incorrect in terms of length. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body list works again.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving left, the snake shifts its body segments accordingly:

After step 3a: [new_head=4,9], H=(5,9), B1=(5,8). Then step 3b removes last element (B1) because not eating apple. So new_body is [(4,9), (5,9)].

So now the snake's body list has two elements: head at (4,9), and one segment at (5,9).

But wait that can't be right; initial length was 3, moving without growing should make it same? Or do I need to add a new segment?

Wait perhaps when you move into a new position:

- The snake's body is represented as the list of all segments except head.

So if original S has [H, B1, B2], and after inserting H at front (now becomes first), then it's [new_H, H, B1]. Then remove last element: [new_H, H].

Thus, in this case:

S is [(5,9)]. So moving to left would result in S being [(4,9)]?

No, that can't be right. Because a snake needs multiple segments.

Alternatively, maybe when you move into an adjacent cell and insert at front of body list without growing.

Wait perhaps the way it works is:

When facing direction d (e.g., UP), moving forward would change position to next in that direction and adjust body accordingly.

But with all this confusion, perhaps I should instead consider possible directions step by step while avoiding collisions. Maybe try a path where we first turn around and then head towards the apple.

So starting at (5,9):

- Turn left from UP to face LEFT.
- Move to (4,9).
Check if any of these positions cause collision when moving:

But before that, let's note that in order not to collide with body segments. Since after movement, the new_head must not be adjacent to any part of the previous_body except for where it will attach.

Wait no: The rule says that a forward move is invalid if head would collide with existing body parts (other than by moving into a tail that's about to move). So perhaps when we insert new_head and then remove last element, the new_head must not be adjacent to any of the current_body except for the one it will attach.

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think in terms of each movement step:

First Movement Step (after changing direction):

- Current head: (5,9), facing LEFT.
- Move to (4,9).

Check if this new position is valid:
- It's inside grid (assuming 0 <= x,y < something).
- Check the previous body parts. Previous body was [(5,8), (6,8)].

Is (4,9) adjacent to any of these? Let's see:

(5,8) is one unit left and down from (4,9). So yes, moving to (4,9) would cause head to be at (4,9), which is diagonally adjacent to (5,8). Wait but according to the rule, movement is only invalid if the new head position shares a side with any body part.

So in this case, (4,9) and (5,8): they are not sharing sides. So it's okay.

Wait actually, no: The previous body parts are [(5,8), (6,8)] which are at y=8. Current new head is at (4,9). The distance from (4,9) to any of these would be:

- To (5,8): dx=1, dy=1 --> diagonal
- So no side adjacency.

Thus, moving to (4,9) is okay.

So after this move:

- New head: (4,9)
- Body becomes [(5,9)] (since we inserted new_head and removed the tail of previous_body).

Wait but how? Original body was [B1=(5,8), B2=(6,8)]. After moving to left:

Insert into front: [new_H=(4,9), H=(5,9), B1=(5,8)]. Then remove last element (since not eating apple): new_body = [(4,9), (5,9)].

So now snake's body is [(5,9)], which would mean only one segment. But that seems incorrect because a snake should have at least two segments except when it starts.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body list works. Maybe each time you move forward without eating apple, the body shifts by moving all segments towards head. So initial S had [H=(5,9), B1=(5,8), B2=(6,8)].

After moving LEFT:

new_head = (4,9).

Insert into front: new_body_before_removal is [(4,9), H=(5,9), B1=(5,8)]. Then remove last element (B1) because not eating apple. So body becomes [ (4,9), (5,9) ].

Wait so the snake's head is now at (4,9), and its body parts are [(5,9)]? That seems like only two segments total: head and one body part. But that was originally three. Hmm, perhaps this isn't correct because each move without eating apple should maintain the same number of body parts.

I think I'm getting stuck on how to represent the snake's body in terms of list elements when moving.

Alternative approach: Maybe model the snake as a linked list where each node represents a segment. So initial segments are [ (5,9) ] followed by [(5,8), (6,8)] if facing right or left. Wait no, maybe not.

Perhaps instead of trying to track the entire body list, focus on the head and the possible next moves that won't cause collision with any existing parts except for where it can attach when shifting.

Given this confusion, perhaps I should outline a general plan:

1. The apple is at (2,4). Current position is (5,9).

We need to move from (5,9) towards (2,4), which requires moving left and down.

So the directions needed are mostly LEFT and DOWN. But considering that the snake can't collide with itself.

Let me consider a path:

From (5,9):

- Facing UP: Can't move forward without leaving grid.
- So change direction to LEFT first step.

Move 1:
- Direction changes from UP to LEFT.
- Move to (4,9).

Check for collision:
- Current body is [(5,8), (6,8)]. New head at (4,9) doesn't collide with any of these. Also, after moving, the new_body would be [ (4,9), (5,9) ] as per earlier logic.

But since this seems confusing, perhaps instead of focusing on the body list, focus on avoiding collision with existing snake parts except when the tail is about to move.

Wait another idea: Perhaps use BFS or some pathfinding algorithm considering possible moves and checking for validity each time. But given that it's a simple grid and limited movement options, maybe a manual plan can be made.

Alternatively, perhaps we should first reduce x (move left) as much as needed, then start moving down towards the apple.

But from current position:

x: 5 --> needs to go to 2: so three left moves.
y:9 --> needs to go to4: five down moves.

So a total of eight steps if we ignore snake's body constraints.

But with snake's body, some of these may be blocked. So need to plan the path carefully.

Let me attempt step by step:

Current position:
- Head at (5,9)
- Body parts at (5,8) and (6,8)
- Direction: UP

Possible moves:

1. Facing UP from (5,9): Can't move because new head would be (5,10), outside grid.

So change direction to LEFT first.

Move 1:
- Head moves to (4,9).

Check for collision: body parts at (5,8) and (6,8). New head is (4,9); not adjacent. So valid move.

New snake:

Body becomes [H=(4,9), (5,9)] because we inserted new_head and removed tail from previous_body.

So after first step:
- Head: (4,9)
- Body parts: [(5,9)]

Next steps should be to face further left or start moving down. But with only one body part now.

Wait but the initial movement reduced body parts from 3 to 2? Hmm, perhaps that's correct because when you turn around and move into a new direction without eating apple, the tail is removed.

Alternatively, maybe after first step, snake has two segments: head at (4,9), one segment at (5,9). So in next steps:

Move 2:
- Current direction from LEFT. Can we continue moving LEFT? New position would be (3,9).

Check if this causes collision with existing body parts.

Existing body is [(5,9)]. So new head at (3,9) isn't adjacent to any of these?

Wait, distance between (3,9) and (5,9) is two units apart. No adjacency except for moving directionally along the same row.

Wait no: The rule says that a move is invalid if it results in the head being on an adjacent square to any body part (excluding when moving into a tail that's about to move). So:

Current snake after Move 1 has segments at (4,9) and (5,9).

When trying to move LEFT from (4,9), new head is at (3,9).

Check if this causes collision with any of the existing body parts.

Existing body parts: only (5,9). So (3,9) isn't adjacent. So valid move.

After moving:

- Insert into front: [new_H=(3,9), H=(4,9), B1=(5,9)]. Then remove last element because not eating apple.
New body becomes [(3,9), (4,9)].

So snake now has head at (3,9) and body parts at (4,9). Hmm. Still only two segments? Or is that correct?

I think it's correct in this case: each move without growing reduces the number of body parts by one because you remove the tail.

Thus after Move 2:

- Head: (3,9)
- Body: [(4,9)]

Move 3:
- Facing LEFT again. Next position would be (2,9).

Check if new head is adjacent to any existing body parts.

Existing body: (4,9). So distance from (2,9) to (4,9): two units apart. Not adjacent.

So valid move.

After moving:

Insert into front: [new_H=(2,9), H=(3,9), B1=(4,9)]. Remove tail because not eating apple.
New body becomes [(2,9), (3,9)].

Now snake's head is at (2,9) with a body part at (3,9).

Move 4:
- Current position: (2,9). Need to start moving down towards the apple at (2,4).
So turn direction from LEFT to DOWN.

Check if this causes collision. New head would be (2,8).

Existing body is [(3,9)]. So new head at (2,8) isn't adjacent to any of these? Let's check:

Distance between (2,8) and (3,9): sqrt(1^2 + 1^2), so diagonally one unit. Thus not sharing a side.

So this move is valid.

After moving:

Insert into front: [new_H=(2,8), H=(2,9), B1=(3,9)]. Remove last element because not eating apple.
New body becomes [(2,8), (2,9)].

Now snake's head at (2,8) and body part at (2,9).

Move 5:
- Direction is DOWN. Next position would be (2,7).

Check collision with existing body parts: [ (2,9) ]. So new head at (2,7). Distance from (2,7) to (2,9): two units apart vertically.

Thus valid move.

After moving:

Insert into front: [new_H=(2,7), H=(2,8), B1=(2,9)]. Remove last element.
New body becomes [(2,7), (2,8)].

Move 6:
- Direction DOWN. Next position is (2,6).

No collision with existing body parts: only at (2,8). So valid move.

After moving:

Insert into front: [new_H=(2,6), H=(2,7), B1=(2,8)]. Remove last element.
New body becomes [(2,6), (2,7)].

Move 7:
- Direction DOWN. Next position is (2,5).

No collision with existing body parts at (2,7). Valid move.

After moving:

Insert into front: [new_H=(2,5), H=(2,6), B1=(2,7)]. Remove last element.
New body becomes [(2,5), (2,6)].

Move 8:
- Direction DOWN. Next position is (2,4).

Which is the apple's location! So this move is valid as long as new head doesn't collide with existing body parts.

Existing body: [ (2,6) ]. New head at (2,4). Distance from (2,4) to (2,6): two units apart. So no collision.

Thus, moving down five times after turning left three times should reach the apple without colliding.

So the sequence of steps is:

1. Turn LEFT.
2. Move to (4,9).
3. Move to (3,9).
4. Move to (2,9).
5. Turn DOWN.
6. Move to (2,8).
7. Move to (2,7).
8. Move to (2,6).
9. Move to (2,5).
10. Move to (2,4).

Each of these moves is valid because the new head doesn't collide with any existing body parts except when moving direction changes.

Wait but in step 5, we turned from LEFT to DOWN and moved into (2,8). Let me double-check if that's okay:

After moving left three times, snake is at (2,9) facing left. Turning down would mean facing south, so next move is (2,8).

Yes, because when you turn direction after having faced left enough, the new movement direction needs to be checked for collision.

But let me go through each step again more carefully:

Move 1: Left from (5,9) to (4,9). No collision.
Move 2: Left to (3,9). No collision.
Move 3: Left to (2,9). No collision.
Now snake is at (2,9), facing left. Next step is turning down.

So direction changes from LEFT to DOWN.

Then move to (2,8): which isn't adjacent to any body parts except for nothing because after three lefts, the only body part was in front of it now moved beyond. Wait no: After moving left thrice, the snake's body has been:
After Move 1: [(4,9), (5,9)]
Wait that doesn't make sense.

Actually, I think my earlier representation is flawed because each move changes the number of body parts based on whether an apple was eaten or not. Since no apples are being eaten here, the snake's body length remains at two segments after three left moves? Hmm, perhaps this indicates a problem with how I'm tracking the snake.

Wait another idea: Instead of tracking all body parts each time, just track the head and direction. Because for collision detection, only the current position of the body is needed to check if the new head would be adjacent. So maybe we don't need to keep track of all previous positions except where it's about to move.

So perhaps represent the snake as its current head position and direction it's facing. For collision checking, see if moving in that direction causes the head to be adjacent (including diagonally) with any part of the body besides the next segment when shifting occurs.

Wait but this seems too vague. Maybe a better approach is:

Each time we move forward, check:
1. Whether the new head position shares an edge (not diagonal) with any existing body parts except for where it would attach when moving.
2. If after movement, the snake's body has a new head and tail that could cause overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps each step should only consider the current head and direction to determine validity, because as long as the next move doesn't make the head adjacent (in any of 8 directions) to any existing segments except for when moving into where the tail is going, it's valid.

Wait but this approach might not account for all possible body parts that could block movement. It could be too simplistic.

In our specific case:

After three left moves from (5,9), we reach (2,9). Facing left at (2,9):

- Next move direction is DOWN.
So new head position would be (2,8).

Check if this is adjacent to any existing body parts. Existing body parts are along the path taken so far:

From initial position:
(5,9) --> moved left thrice: now snake's body is [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9)]? Or perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait no, each time moving without eating apple causes loss of tail segment. So after the first move to (4,9):

- Body becomes [ (5,9) ] because we inserted new head and removed old tail.
After second move: body is [ (3,9), (4,9) ]
Third move: body becomes [ (2,9), (3,9) ]

So after three left moves, snake's segments are at (2,9) and (3,9).

Now facing left from (2,9). Next position would be (1,9)? Wait no.

Wait correction:

Wait when you face left, moving forward decreases x by 1 each time. So:

From (5,9), first move to (4,9).
Then to (3,9).
Then to (2,9).

Now facing left, next possible position would be (1,9). But that's two units away from current head.

Wait but in the earlier thought process I assumed turning DOWN after being at (2,9) and moving down towards (2,4), but that may not account for the correct body segments.

Alternatively, maybe changing direction isn't as straightforward because of snake's body positioning.

Another idea: Perhaps instead of moving all the way left first to minimize x-coordinate before moving down, it might be better to interleave left and down moves to avoid blocking.

But with apple at (2,4), this is possible only once we get into that region. So perhaps initial steps should focus on reducing x while keeping y as high as needed without collision.

I think I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to write out a step-by-step plan based on initial reasoning and see if it works:

Step 1: Turn LEFT.
New head at (4,9). Valid move.

Step 2: Move LEFT to (3,9). Valid.

Step 3: Move LEFT to (2,9). Now facing left. New head is at (2,9).

Now from here, can't face further left because it would be (1,9), which is okay if no collision, but also the snake's body after step 3:

After Step 3:
- Body parts are [(3,9), (4,9)].

Wait wait: No. After each move without eating apple, tail is removed. So from Step 2 to Step 3:

Step1: Head at (4,9). Body: [5,8], [6,8] → after moving, becomes [5,9].

But I think this approach isn't working because of confusion in tracking.

Perhaps better to instead try a path with minimal left turns and maximal down movement early on.

Alternative plan:

1. From (5,9), face DOWN.
2. Move south as much as possible without collision.

Check if moving down from (5,9) is possible: new head would be at (5,8). Existing body parts are at (5,8) and (6,8). So (5,8) overlaps with existing body part? Wait no:

Wait the initial position after first move could have changed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's impossible to face south from (5,9) because that would cause immediate collision. Let me check:

Moving down from (5,9) would take head to (5,8). But since in initial state body parts are at (5,9), moving there would result in same position as current body part.

Wait no: Initial body is just the starting cell? Or it's surrounded by walls?

Assuming that snake starts with one segment and can move into adjacent cells. So from (5,9), moving down to (5,8) would check if any of the 8 surrounding cells have a body part except for where it will be attaching when shifting.

Wait I'm getting stuck on collision detection logic without a clear model of how snake's body is represented.

Maybe an alternative approach: Since we need to reach (2,4), let's plan the path from there backwards. This could simplify things because apple is at end point.

So starting from (2,4):

To get there, previous position would be either up, left, right, or down relative to current position.

But since it's snake movement, each step requires that new head doesn't collide with body parts except for attaching when moving.

Alternatively, think of it as a path where each move reduces the distance to apple and is collision-free.

Wait perhaps the key steps are:

- Reduce x from 5 to 2: require three left moves.
- Then reduce y from 9 to 4: five down moves.

But ensuring that these movements don't cause snake's body parts to block.

So the sequence would be moving left thrice, then down five times. But as in earlier thought process, I have to make sure each move doesn't result in collision with any existing body segments except for when shifting tail.

But according to initial reasoning, after three lefts:

Snake is at (2,9), facing left. Next move would be south, so new head at (2,8). Since the snake's body was along (4,9) → (3,9) → (2,9), now after moving, the body becomes [(2,9)] and [(3,9)]. Wait no: each time you move without eating apple, you remove the tail.

Wait let me represent it correctly:

After initial position at (5,9). Moving left to (4,9): body becomes [ (5,8), (6,8) ]? Or am I getting this wrong?

Perhaps a better approach is to model the snake's body as a list of positions. Each move appends new head and removes old tail.

So initial position: [(5,9)]. Since no segments after that, just one cell.

Move 1: Left → (4,9). Now body is [ (5,8), (6,8) ]? Or perhaps not. Wait the initial position was at (5,9), so moving left to (4,9) makes it the new head, and since we didn't eat any apple, the old tail (which wasn't present except for current head) is removed.

Wait no: when you move without eating an apple, your body just grows by one segment in front. Wait that's not correct either; snake moves forward and leaves its tail.

Wait perhaps each move adds a new head at direction step and removes the old last position as tail.

So if initial position is [(5,9)], moving left would make it [ (4,9) ]. No change to body since only one segment. Wait that can't be right because in most snake games, movement requires adding a new head and removing tail when no apple eaten.

Wait this indicates that I'm misunderstanding the mechanics of snake movement as per problem statement.

Re-reading the problem:

"the rules for moving: If you move forward without eating an apple, your body will shrink by one segment."

So each time you move forward (not eat apple), your body shrinks by one. So how does this happen?

Assuming that when a snake moves forward and doesn't eat, it leaves the tail behind.

Wait perhaps in movement:

- When you turn direction without eating an apple, you can only move into empty spaces.
- Upon moving, if there's no apple to eat at new position:
   - You add your head (new cell)
   - The last segment of body is removed

So for a single-segment snake: [(5,9)]. Moving left would become [ (4,9) ] since tail isn't present. So only one segment.

But that's not possible because when you have longer snake, movement affects the entire body.

Wait maybe each time you move without eating an apple:

- The new head is added at direction step.
- The last cell of current body is removed (tail).

So for a snake with n segments: moving forward will keep all but one segment after adding new head. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

This confusion makes tracking the snake's body after each move tricky without knowing exact rules.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that when you turn direction and then move into an adjacent cell:

- If there is no apple in the new position:
   - The current head moves to new position.
   - The last segment (tail) of the body disappears.
So for a snake with length L: after moving without eating, it's still length L.

Wait that contradicts "shrink by one". So perhaps:

When you move forward into an empty cell and don't eat apple:
- Add head to new position
- Remove tail segment

Thus body increases by 1? Or is the description wrong?

Alternatively, maybe when moving without eating, your body length remains same.

Wait original problem says: "If you move forward without eating an apple, your body will shrink by one segment."

So if snake has n segments before movement:
After moving and not eating, it's (n - 1) segments.

Which suggests that in such a case:

- New head is added.
- Old tail is removed to make space. So total remains same?

Wait but if you have n segments, moving forward would require adding a new segment without losing any; thus the length increases? Or perhaps it's a typo and body grows by one.

This makes solving problem tricky because snake's movement changes its shape based on this rule.

Alternatively, maybe when moving into an empty cell:

- If there is no apple to eat at new position:
   - The snake moves forward: new head is added in front.
   - The last segment (tail) is removed.

So for example, a two-segment snake [(5,9), (6,9)] facing left. Move without eating:

New head would be at (4,9). Tail at (6,9) is removed. So new body becomes [ (4,9), (5,9) ].

Wait but this contradicts the "shrink by one" because it went from 2 to 2 again.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating; maybe focus on step-by-step movement without getting bogged down in exact mechanics.

In conclusion:

To reach apple at (2,4), snake needs to move left three times and then down five times. This seems possible based on initial reasoning that each of these moves doesn't cause collision with body parts except when the tail is moved out of way.
</think>

The solution involves moving the snake first by turning LEFT twice more and then DOWN four times from (2,9) to reach the apple at (2,4). 

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Start at (5,9), facing LEFT.

2. Move left three times:
   - Move 1: (5,9) → (4,9)
   - Move 2: (4,9) → (3,9)
   - Move 3: (3,9) → (2,9)

3. After reaching (2,9), turn DOWN.

4. Move down five times:
   - Move 1: (2,9) → (2,8)
   - Move 2: (2,8) → (2,7)
   - Move 3: (2,7) → (2,6)
   - Move 4: (2,6) → (2,5)
   - Move 5: (2,5) → (2,4)

Final Answer:
The snake can reach the apple by moving left three times and then down five times. So the sequence of movements is LEFT ×3 followed by DOWN ×5.

$\boxed{(2,4)}$
