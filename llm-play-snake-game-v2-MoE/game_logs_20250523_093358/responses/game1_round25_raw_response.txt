========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

I'll help you plan a safe path for the snake to reach the apple while following all the rules.

Let's analyze the current state:
- Head position: (1, 5)
- Current direction: UP
- Body cells: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4)]
- Apple position: (0, 5)

From this information, I notice that the snake is currently headed UP and cannot reverse direction immediately. The apple is directly to the left of the current head position.

Let's plan a safe path:
1. First move LEFT from (1, 5) to (0, 5), which puts us at the apple position.
2. Eating the apple will make this position part of the body, so we need to ensure there are no immediate collisions afterward.

Since we're currently moving UP and can't reverse immediately, our first move must be LEFT. After that, we would eat the apple at (0, 5).

Let's check if any other moves could be dangerous:
- If we try to go RIGHT, we'd collide with body part (1, 4).
- We cannot go DOWN since it would reverse direction from UP.

So our safe path is simply to move LEFT once to eat the apple. After eating the apple at (0, 5), the tail will remain in place, and no immediate danger exists.

Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "Move LEFT from (1, 5) directly to the apple at (0, 5). This is the safest path given current direction constraints."
}
```

This plan follows all movement rules and avoids any immediate danger.
