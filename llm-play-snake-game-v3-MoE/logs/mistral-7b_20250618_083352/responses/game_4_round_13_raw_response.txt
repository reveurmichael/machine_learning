 {
     "moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN"],
     "reasoning": "Since the head is currently located at (4,6) and the apple is at (3,2), it requires moving 1 unit to the left and 4 units down to reach the apple safely. This direction change avoids immediate self-collision and border hugging, while ensuring a continuous body after each move."
