========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake is at (4,7), and the apple is at (4,3). So, the head is on the same x-coordinate as the apple but higher up in y. That means the snake needs to move down along the same column to reach the apple.

First, let's consider the current direction, which is "RIGHT". The movement rule says that we can't reverse direction immediately. So if the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT. Therefore, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

The head is at (4,7). Moving right would take it to (5,7), but that doesn't help towards reaching the apple which is at x=4. So moving right isn't ideal unless there's a reason to change direction later. Similarly, moving up from (4,7) would take it out of bounds since y can only go up to 9, but 7+1=8 is still within bounds. Wait, no—the grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. So moving up increases y by 1 each time.

Wait, the apple is at (4,3), which is lower in the y-coordinate than the head's current position. So to get there, the snake needs to move down four times (from y=7 to y=3). That means the snake should start moving down as soon as possible.

But the initial direction is RIGHT. The first move can't be LEFT because of the no-reverse rule. So from RIGHT, the next moves can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. But since we need to go down, the optimal first move would be DOWN.

Let's see if that's safe. After moving down, the new head is at (4,6). The body cells are [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. So after the move, the old head (4,7) becomes the first body cell. Then we have to check for collisions.

The new head is (4,6). Are any of the body cells in this position? The body cells are [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. So (4,6) isn't among them except maybe if the tail was at that spot when it's about to move. But since we're moving down, and the body will shift accordingly.

Wait, after moving down, the body will add the old head (4,7) as the first body segment. The new body list becomes [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple, the tail (1,6) is removed. So the body after moving down would be [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)].

So the new head is at (4,6), and the body cells are [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)]. None of these are at (4,6) except possibly the tail if it's moving. But since we're not eating an apple, the tail moves as usual.

Therefore, the first move is safe: DOWN.

Next, after moving down once, the head is at (4,6), and the body is [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)]. The next step would be to continue moving down. But we need to check if that's possible without collision.

Moving down again from (4,6) takes us to (4,5). Let's check the body after this move. The new head is (4,5). The old head (4,6) becomes part of the body. So the body list would be [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)]. Wait, no—each step involves moving the head and shifting the body.

Wait, after the first move (DOWN), the body is [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)]. So when we make another DOWN move, the new head is (4,5). The old head (4,6) becomes part of the body. Then, since we're not eating an apple, the tail (1,7) would be removed.

So after the second move, the body list is [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7)]. Because the tail was at (1,7), which gets removed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think about how the body updates after each move.

Each time we move, the head moves first, then the body shifts. If not eating an apple, the tail is removed; if eating, it stays.

In this case, since the apple is at (4,3), which is four steps down from the initial position, and the snake isn't growing until it reaches the apple, each move will require the snake to go straight down without any turns except maybe adjusting direction.

Wait, but in the first step, moving DOWN is allowed because we're not reversing. So after moving down once, the head is at (4,6), and the body is [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)].

Now, for the next move, what direction can we take? Since our current direction is now DOWN, the next move can't be UP. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

But since we're moving down towards the apple, continuing to move down makes sense. However, let's check if that's safe.

If we move down again from (4,6), we reach (4,5). The body after this move would be [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)] but then the tail is removed because we didn't eat an apple. Wait no—the body list before the move was [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)]. After moving down to (4,5), the old head becomes part of the body at position 0. Then, since not eating apple, we remove the last element (1,7). So the new body is [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7)].

So the new body list after two moves would be [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7)], and the head is at (4,5).

Is there any collision? The new head is at (4,5). Are any of the body cells in that position?

The body is [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7)]. None are at (4,5), so it's safe.

Continuing this way, we can keep moving down. Let's simulate a few more steps.

After third move DOWN to (4,4):

- Head is at (4,4).
- Old head (4,5) becomes part of the body.
- Body list before the move: [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7)].
- After moving down and adding old head, the body becomes [(4,5), (3,7), (2,7)].
- Then, remove tail (since not eating apple): so body is [(4,5), (3,7)].

Check for collision: (4,4) isn't in any of the body cells except perhaps if it's about to move. The body after this step would be [(4,5), (3,7)], so no collision.

Fourth move DOWN to (4,3):

- Head is at (4,3), which is where the apple is.
- So we eat the apple here.

Eating the apple means:

1. New head is (4,3).
2. Body list before eating: [(4,5), (3,7)].
3. Insert old head (4,4) into body as first element → new body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (3,7)].
4. Since we ate the apple, do not remove tail. So body remains at length 3.

Now, check for collision when moving to (4,3):

- The body before eating is [(4,5), (3,7)]. But wait, actually, after the move, the new head is (4,3). We need to check if this position collides with any body cells except possibly the tail.

Wait, in the step where we eat the apple:

The new head is computed. Then, before shifting the body, we check for collisions.

So, when moving down to (4,3), which is the apple's position, we need to ensure that this new head doesn't collide with any body cells except perhaps the tail when it moves.

But in this case, after eating the apple, the body will not remove the tail. So the body before moving was [(4,5), (3,7)]. The tail is at (3,7). When we eat the apple, the old head (4,4) is added to the front of the body list. But since we ate the apple, the tail remains.

So after eating, the body becomes [(4,4), (4,5), (3,7)] plus the new head? Wait no—after moving and eating, the body updates as follows:

After computing new_head = (4,3):

- Insert old head (4,4) into front of body → [(4,4), (4,5), (3,7)].
- Since we ate the apple, don't remove tail. So body is now [(4,4), (4,5), (3,7)].

So, when checking for collisions before shifting the body, the new head is at (4,3). Are any of the previous body cells in this position?

The old body was [(4,5), (3,7)]. Neither of these are (4,3), so it's safe.

Therefore, moving down four times in total will bring the snake to the apple. However, since the initial direction is RIGHT, the first move can't be LEFT. So starting with DOWN is allowed.

But wait—can we make the first move DOWN? The initial direction is RIGHT, and the possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.

Yes, moving DOWN is allowed because it's not a reverse of RIGHT. So the sequence would be:

1. Move DOWN to (4,6)
2. Move DOWN to (4,5)
3. Move DOWN to (4,4)
4. Move DOWN to (4,3) – eat apple

But after eating the apple at step 4, we need to make sure that in the next move (if any), we don't reverse direction.

Wait, but once we reach the apple and eat it, the snake grows by one cell because the tail isn't removed. So after eating, the body is [(4,4), (4,5), (3,7)], as per earlier.

Now, for the next move after eating the apple at (4,3), what can we do? The current direction would now be DOWN since that's how we arrived here. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.

But where to go from here? Since we've already reached the apple, perhaps the simulation is complete. But if there were more steps needed, this would require further planning.

However, in this case, the main goal is to reach (4,3), so four moves down should suffice.

So, summarizing:

1. Initial position: head at (4,7), body [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)]
2. Move DOWN to (4,6): safe
3. Move DOWN to (4,5): safe
4. Move DOWN to (4,4): safe
5. Move DOWN to (4,3): eat apple, body grows

Each of these moves is allowed and doesn't cause a collision.

Another consideration: are there any obstacles or other parts of the body that might block the path? In this case, the snake's own body seems to be moving down, so as long as each new head position isn't occupied by a body segment (except possibly the tail when it moves), it should be safe.

But wait, after the first move DOWN to (4,6), the body becomes [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)]. So in this case, the new head is at (4,6), which isn't part of the body except for the previous head at (4,7). So no collision.

Similarly, after moving down again to (4,5), the body becomes [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7)]. Again, no collision with new head.

So yes, this path is feasible.
</think>

The optimal sequence of moves for the snake to reach the apple at (4,3) from its initial position at (4,7) without reversing direction is four consecutive DOWN moves. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Position**: Head at (4,7), body segments [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)].

2. **First Move**: DOWN to (4,6). This is allowed since the current direction isn't LEFT, and moving DOWN doesn't reverse. After this move:
   - Head: (4,6)
   - Body becomes [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)] after removing the tail.

3. **Second Move**: DOWN to (4,5). Safe as no collision with body segments.
   - Head: (4,5)
   - Body becomes [(4,6), (3,7), (2,7)] after tail removal.

4. **Third Move**: DOWN to (4,4). Again, safe movement.
   - Head: (4,4)
   - Body becomes [(4,5), (3,7)] after tail removal.

5. **Fourth Move**: DOWN to (4,3). This position is the apple's location, so the snake eats it and grows:
   - Head: (4,3) – Apple eaten.
   - Body updates by adding old head (4,4) at front, becoming [(4,4), (4,5), (3,7)] without removing the tail.

**Answer**: The shortest path is four moves DOWN.
