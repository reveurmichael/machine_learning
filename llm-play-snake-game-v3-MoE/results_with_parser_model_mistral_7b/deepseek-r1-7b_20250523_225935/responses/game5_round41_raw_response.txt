========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm trying to help a snake navigate from its current position at (9,3) to eat an apple located at (8,2). The snake is currently moving right and has some body parts that are blocking its path.

First, the snake's head is at (9,3), which is pretty close to the apple. The directions it can move in are RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN, or NONE. But since the snake isn't allowed to reverse direction on the first move, and RIGHT was the last direction mentioned... Wait, no, actually, according to the problem statement, the initial direction is RIGHT, but that's part of the input, not something we need to plan for in our moves because we're starting from there. So I don't have to consider changing the initial direction unless necessary.

But wait, looking back at the problem, it says the current direction is "RIGHT", and our task is to find a sequence of directions to move towards the apple at (8,2). The snake's body is given as [(8,3), (8,4)], which are behind the head. So the full snake so far is [ (9,3) as head, followed by (8,3), then (8,4)]. Wait, no—wait, according to the problem statement, the body cells list excludes the head and goes from behind the head to the tail. So in this case, it's [ (8,3), (8,4) ], which would mean the snake is moving down along x=8.

So the current snake looks like:
Head at (9,3)
Body1 at (8,3)
Body2 at (8,4)

And then presumably the tail beyond that. But in this case, since there are only two body cells after the head, it's a snake of length 4: head + two body segments and a tail which is not listed.

Wait no—actually, wait. The problem says "Body cells" list (in inputs) excludes the head and goes from BODY1 to BODYN. So in this case, the input is [ (8,3), (8,4) ]. That would mean that the snake's body starts at (8,3) as BODY1 and then (8,4) as BODY2, implying a tail beyond that which isn't listed.

But when it moves, according to the movement rules: step 3 says if not eating apple, remove the last body cell. So in this case, after moving, the snake would have its head moved forward, and the tail removed unless it eats an apple.

Now, our goal is to reach (8,2). The snake is currently at (9,3), so we need to move left once (from x=9 to 8) but also down from y=3 to y=2. So in terms of movement, the head needs to go west and south.

But considering that the body blocks our path: the snake's current position is such that moving directly left would take us into (8,3), which is behind the head, but that cell is already occupied by BODY1. Wait no—the head can move into any of its adjacent cells except for those occupied by the body when it shifts.

Wait, the rules state that if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current position (when that tail will move), then collision occurs. So in this case, before moving, we have to ensure that new_head doesn't land on any of the current body segments, excluding where the tail would be after movement.

But wait, no—the rule says if the new head is coinciding with any BODYi except when it's the tail that will move (i.e., when the snake eats apple and grows). So in this case, since we're not eating an apple yet (the apple isn't part of the body), moving into any body segment (8,3) or (8,4) would cause collision.

So to avoid that, our movement has to be such that new_head doesn't land on these positions. But currently, head is at (9,3). Moving left takes us to (8,3), which is the position of BODY1. So we can't move directly left if we're about to eat apple.

Alternatively, perhaps moving down would take us from y=3 to 2. Let's see: new_head = (9,2). Is that a safe cell? Because it's not occupied by any body segments currently—current body is at (8,3) and (8,4). So (9,2) is clear.

Wait, so if we move down once:

new_head would be (9, 2).

Check for collision: does this new_head coincide with any BODYi? The current body cells are (8,3), (8,4), which do not include (9,2). So that's safe. Then, since it's moving towards the apple at (8,2), but first we have to check if (9,2) is adjacent to the tail. Wait no—the snake has a body beyond the head.

Wait, in this case, after moving down once, new_head becomes (9,2). The body list before movement was [head=(9,3), (8,3), (8,4)]. After inserting the old head at front and removing last element if not eating apple:

So, insert (9,3) into the front of the body list. Then since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail—so previous last element was (8,4). Now the new full snake is [ (9,2), (9,3), (8,3), (8,4) ]. So the head moves to (9,2).

But now, when moving further, we need to check for future collisions. Wait, but according to rule 1: collision occurs if new_head is outside grid or into a BODY cell that isn't the tail's current position.

Wait no—it says before body shifts. So during movement planning, we have to consider where each part of the body will end up after moving.

So for example, when considering the next move, all the body segments (including their new positions) must not block our path.

But in this specific case, since the apple is at (8,2), which is one step left and one step down from current head position (9,3). So to reach it directly, we would need a clear path through each cell between. But moving straight up may be blocked by the body.

Alternatively, perhaps making a U-turn or a slight detour could help.

But first, let's think about possible directions:

Current direction is RIGHT, but according to rules, if initial direction isn't NONE and you can't reverse, so after moving in one direction, next move cannot be opposite unless it's allowed. But the problem says that we're starting from (9,3) with current direction RIGHT, so our first move options are limited.

Wait no—the movement example showed that after eating apple, you can grow, but for this problem, since the snake is currently in a certain state and hasn't eaten the apple yet, it's moving towards it. But we have to plan directions step by step.

So perhaps starting with moving down once would be better because (8,2) is just one cell left from current head's x-coordinate. So let's see:

First move: DOWN

new_head = (9-0, 3 -1) = (9,2).

Check collision: no body cells at (9,2), so safe.

Update body: insert old head (9,3) to front of body list and remove last element (8,4). So the new snake is [ (9,2), (9,3), (8,3), (8,4) ].

Now, current direction was RIGHT. But according to movement rules, after a move, you can't reverse on next turn unless it's allowed by rules. Wait no—rule 2 says: Cannot reverse direction if the last move wasn't NONE. So since we moved right initially, and now our first move is down, which isn't reversing.

Wait, but in this case, current direction was RIGHT before movement; after moving down, perhaps next directions have to be considered with that constraint.

But regardless, let's proceed step by step.

Next positions: from (9,2), possible moves:

- LEFT would take us back to x=8, y=2—directly towards apple. But we need to check if that cell is blocked.

Current body after first move: [ (9,2) as head, then (9,3), (8,3), (8,4) ]. So moving left from (9,2) would take us to (8,2). Is this a valid position?

Check for collision with current body before movement. The new_head is (8,2). Are any of the body segments in [ (8,2) ] except when it's the tail? The body after first move doesn't include (8,2), so no collision.

But wait: when moving left from (9,2) to (8,2), we have to ensure that this new cell is not part of the current body. Current body includes (9,3), (8,3), and (8,4). So yes, (8,2) is clear.

So if we move LEFT next:

new_head = (8,2), which is our target apple position.

Since it's an apple position, we grow the snake: do not remove tail. So body list becomes [ (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (8,3) ].

Now, after this move, the head has reached the apple at (8,2). But according to movement rules, after eating, there must be a legal next move.

So we have just moved into (8,2), which is the target. Now, what happens next? The snake's body now includes [ (8,2) as head, followed by (9,2), then (9,3), (8,3), and presumably more cells beyond that—wait no, because in this case, after eating apple, we don't remove the tail. So if initial body was length 4 ([head] + [8,3], [8,4]), after moving left into [8,2], which is a new head, and since it's an apple, we add (8,2) to front without removing anything else.

Wait no—rule says: when you eat the apple, you grow by adding one segment. So initial body was 3 segments ([head] + two others). After moving into apple position, snake becomes [apple head, old head, then previous body]. Wait let me think:

Initial state after first move (DOWN):

- Snake is at [9,2], which is head.

Body list: [9,3], followed by 8,3 and 8,4. So length of the snake was 4 cells before movement? Or wait, initial given body cells are two—so probably the snake's total length is three (head plus two body parts). After moving down once:

- Insert old head at front: [9,3] becomes new first segment.

Then, since it's not an apple move, remove last element of body list. Original body was [(8,3), (8,4)], so after removing last, the new snake is [new_head=(9,2), then 9,3, followed by (8,3)].

Wait no—the movement steps are:

1. Calculate new_head: (9,2).

2. Check if it's apple position—no.

3. Insert old head into front of body list.

So original snake was [head=(9,3), 8,3, 8,4].

After moving down to (9,2):

new_body_list = [old_head] + remaining_body_without_last_element.

Old_head is (9,3).

Remaining_body is all except the last: so it's [(8,3)].

Wait wait, original body was [(8,3), (8,4)]. So inserting old head at front gives:

[ (9,3) ] followed by [8,3], then 8,4. Then since we're not eating apple, remove the last element: so new_body_list becomes [ (9,3), (8,3) ]. So snake is now length 2? But that seems contradictory because a snake can't have only two segments.

Wait no—I think I'm making a mistake here. The initial body cells are [(8,3), (8,4)], which implies the snake's body beyond the head is of length N-1 where N is total segments. So if we have head plus two body parts, that makes three segments in total: head and two body parts.

So when moving to new_head=(9,2):

Insert old_head into front of body_list:

body_list becomes [ (9,3) ] + [(8,3), (8,4)] → which is length 3. Then since not eating apple, remove last element—so body list becomes [ (9,3), (8,3) ].

So now snake's head is at (9,2), followed by (9,3), then (8,3). So that makes the total snake segments: three (head and two body parts).

But wait, moving left from (9,2) to (8,2):

new_head = (8,2)

Since it's an apple position:

- Insert old_head into front.

Old_head is (9,2), so new_body_list becomes [ (9,2) ] + [(9,3), (8,3)] → but since we're eating the apple, no need to remove tail. So body list remains as [ (9,2), 9,3, 8,3 ]

Wait that seems like a loop—snake moving into itself.

But in any case, after this move, the snake's head is at (8,2). Now we have to check if there's a legal next move. The rules say you need at least one valid move remaining.

So looking from (8,2), where can we go?

Possible directions:

- LEFT: x becomes 7, y=2 → but that would be towards the lower left of current snake position.

But let's see if it's a valid cell. Current body is [9,2], then 9,3, 8,3.

Wait no—after eating apple, our snake is at (8,2), followed by (9,2) as new head? Wait I'm getting confused with the movement steps again.

Let me clarify:

- After moving left to (8,2), which is an apple position. So according to rules: after eating, you add a segment without removing any parts beyond that.

So initial state before this move was snake at [9,3], 8,3, 8,4].

After first move down, body becomes [9,3] + [8,3]. Then when moving left into apple:

new_head is (8,2). Insert old_head (9,2) to front of body.

Body list: [ (9,2), (9,3), 8,3 ]

So now the snake's segments are head at (8,2), followed by (9,2), then (9,3), then (8,3).

Wait that seems a bit odd, but technically possible as long as no overlapping.

Now, from here, if we attempt to move further—say moving up would take us back into the body. So perhaps turning right or left is better.

Alternatively, maybe after reaching apple position, there needs to be at least one more valid move without causing collision.

But in this case, since (8,2) was our target and we've reached it by moving LEFT from previous step's head at (9,2), but looking back—perhaps the path is blocked because of snake body parts around that area.

Alternatively, perhaps after eating apple, we need to check if any further movement is possible without collision or going out of grid. But according to rule 3, since it was an apple move, no tail removal happens, so the next step's new_head must not coincide with any current or future body positions (except maybe for when the snake would have a new tail in the next step).

But this seems complicated.

Wait another approach: perhaps after moving into (8,2), we can't reverse direction immediately because that could lead to collision. So let me think—maybe instead of going LEFT first, find another path.

Alternatively, is there a way to move towards apple without getting blocked?

Current snake's body after first down move:

[9,3] as head,

then 8,3,

and then 8,4.

If we try to move up from (9,3), new_head would be (9-0, 3+1) = (9,4). But is that cell free?

In this scenario, current body includes x=8 and y=3 and 4. So (9,4) isn't part of the body yet. So moving up to (9,4) would be a safe move.

Then, after moving up:

Insert old_head into front: so [9,4] becomes new head,

and remove last element from body: which was 8,4, leaving us with [8,3].

So snake is now [ (9,4), 9,3, 8,3 ].

But this seems to be increasing the length of the snake. But wait, initial body after first move was two segments beyond head—so adding another might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better not to reverse direction and go straight for apple.

Wait I think trying a different approach: let me outline all possible moves step by step from starting position until reaching (8,2), ensuring that each step is collision-free and that the snake can continue moving after that.

Starting position:

Snake head at (9,3).

Body segments behind it are [ (8,3), (8,4) ].

Current direction: RIGHT. But according to problem statement, our task isn't about changing initial direction but planning a path towards apple given current state and movement rules.

So first move options from (9,3):

1. Move DOWN → new_head = (9,2). Check collision with body? Current body is [8,3], 8,4—so no. So that's safe. Then snake becomes:

   Insert old head at front: (9,3) followed by (8,3), then after removing tail: only two segments.

Wait maybe more accurately, the initial movement steps are as per rules:

- Move to new_head = (9,2).

- Body list before movement is [ (8,3), 8,4 ].

- Insert old head (9,3) at front → [ (9,3), 8,3, 8,4 ]

- Since not eating apple, remove last element: [ (9,3), 8,3 ]

So after first move down, snake is:

   Head at (9,2)

   Body segments: (9,3) and 8,3.

Now from here, what's the next step?

Current position: (9,2).

Possible directions:

- LEFT → new_head = (8,2). Is this an apple? Yes. So moving into it would be eating.

But wait in our case, we need to reach (8,2), which is the apple location. But according to movement rules, when you eat the apple, you add a segment without removing any previous ones—except for tail if not growing.

Wait no—if you move into an apple cell during your current step, then it's an eating move: so snake grows by one, and you don't remove anything else except maybe if the new movement is followed by another movement that causes collision?

No—it's more about whether in this particular move. So when moving into (8,2), which is an apple:

   Insert old_head (9,2) at front.

Body list before: [9,3], 8,3

After inserting and not eating? No—wait we are moving into the apple cell, so it's an eating move.

So rules for movement when eating apple:

- Insert old_head to front of body.

   So new_body_list = [ (9,2) ] + [(9,3), 8,3]

But since you've eaten apple, don't remove anything—so the snake is now four segments: head at (8,2), then (9,2), followed by (9,3), then 8,3.

Wait that seems a bit odd because it's creating a loop? Or not?

Now from this new position:

   Head is at (8,2).

Possible directions to move are limited—what cells can be reached without collision and ensuring movement beyond current head.

But since we've just eaten the apple, according to rule 3, after that step, the next step must ensure that moving forward is possible. So let's see:

Current body after eating apple: [8,2], (9,2), (9,3), 8,3]

So if I try to move right from head at (8,2):

new_head would be (7,2).

Check for collision with current body: snake has segments at x=8 and 9. So moving left is towards x=7—no conflict.

Is it an apple cell? No—the only apples in the grid are where?

Wait wait—the original problem states there's an apple somewhere else—in this case, (8,2) was the target we moved into, so maybe that's the only apple on the board. So no other apples exist elsewhere.

So moving left to 7,2:

Is that cell free? Current body includes x=8 and above—no cells at x=7,y=2 are occupied by snake beyond head (which is [8,2])?

Wait the snake's body segments after eating apple are: 

head = 8,2

then next segment 9,2 → which was old_head,

then 9,3,

then 8,3.

So no parts of the snake are at x=7,y=2. So moving left is safe.

So step would be:

- Move LEFT to (7,2).

Check for collision: none with body or out of bounds.

Insert old_head into front—old head was (8,2), so new_body_list becomes [8,2] → but that's the head? Wait no—it should insert (8,2) at front and then append remaining segments.

Wait wait:

After eating apple:

   Body list is [head: 8,2], followed by previous body excluding last element?

No—earlier step was moving down to 9,2 and body after that move was [9,3,8,3].

Then when moving left into (8,2):

- Insert old_head which was (9,2) at front → new_body becomes [(9,2),9,3,8,3]

But then since it's an apple move, no tail is removed.

So now the snake after this step would have:

Head: 8,2

Body segments: [7,2], 8,2?

Wait I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to represent each movement as per rules.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of moving down first and then into apple cell directly, find a different path that avoids such issues.

But this is getting too complicated for an initial problem-solving step without knowing the exact structure of the body beyond given segments.

Maybe I should approach it differently: think about possible moves from (9,3) towards (8,2), avoiding any immediate collisions and ensuring there's at least one next move available after reaching apple position.

Alternatively, perhaps moving left initially is causing a problem due to snake body positioning. Maybe trying another direction first.

Wait initial head is at (9,3). Body behind it is [8,3], 8,4]. So from here:

Possible moves are:

- UP → (9,4)

   Check for collision: current body includes y=3 and 4 in x=8. So moving up to 9,4 would be safe.

Then, after moving up, snake's new head is at 9,4.

Body list before movement was [8,3], 8,4]. After inserting old_head (9,3) and removing last element:

new_body_list = [(9,3), 8,3].

So now from position (9,4), body behind is 8,3.

Next possible moves:

   LEFT → x becomes 8, y=4. So new_head at 8,4.

Is this cell free? Current body includes 8,3 but not yet 8,4—so moving to 8,4 is safe as snake hasn't reached there yet?

Wait no—if the original body has a segment at (8,4), then that's part of our initial given. Wait no—the initial body was [8,3], 8,4]. So when we moved up from 9,3 to 9,4:

   Insert old_head (9,3) → new_body becomes [(9,3), 8,3]

Then after removing last element (since not eating apple): [(9,3)]?

Wait I'm getting tangled again.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a different order would prevent these issues. But this seems to require more step-by-step analysis than possible without seeing the full body structure beyond given points.

Given time constraints, maybe it's best to assume that from (8,2), after eating apple, there must be at least one more valid move—so we need to find a path where movement is possible in all steps until then.

Perhaps the initial step of moving left into (9,2) and then up into 8,2 leads to an issue because it causes snake body parts overlapping when trying to reverse direction. So maybe instead, after moving down to 9,2, move right back towards head— no, that would cause collision with own body.

Alternatively, perhaps the only way is to accept that reaching (8,2) from initial position requires certain steps and then ensuring there's a next move available. But without more precise information about the snake's body beyond given segments, it's hard to be exact.

Given all this complexity, I think the most straightforward path towards apple at (8,2) is:

1. Move down once to reach (9,2).

   - No collision with current body—safe.

   - After moving, snake becomes [9,3], 8,3] → wait no—I'm not sure about this step's body list after the move. But assuming it's safe.

2. From there, attempt to move left into (8,2) as apple position:

   - Inserting old_head and adding new segment—snake grows by one without removing tail.

But then from (8,2), we have to ensure next movement is possible. Since the snake body would be [9,2], 8,3, etc., moving further left or up could cause issues.

Alternatively, perhaps after eating apple at (8,2), another move can be made—e.g., right again into (7,2)—which seems safe as no parts of the body are there yet.

But in any case, given time constraints and complexity, I'll outline a possible sequence:

- Move down to 9,2

- Then left to 8,2 (apple)

Assuming this is acceptable with respect to collision checks and that after apple move, another valid movement exists. So the directions would be 'DOWN' followed by 'LEFT'.

Thus, the moves are: DOWN, LEFT.
</think>

To reach the apple located at position $(8,2)$ starting from $(9,3)$ while avoiding self-collision, we need to plan each step carefully.

1. **First Move (DOWN):**
   - Moving down from $(9,3)$ leads to $(9,2)$. 
   - Check for collisions: The body parts are at $(8,3)$ and $(8,4)$, so this move is safe.
   - After moving:
     - Snake's head becomes $(9,2)$.
     - Insert the previous head $(9,3)$ into the front of the body list without removing any existing segments (since it's not an apple move).
     - Final snake positions: $[9,3]$, $8,3$, and $8,4]$.

2. **Second Move (LEFT):**
   - From $(9,2)$, moving left to $(8,2)$ which is the target position for the apple.
   - Check collision: No parts of the snake are at this new position beyond the head.
   - After moving:
     - Snake's head becomes $(8,2)$.
     - Insert previous head $(9,2)$ into front and add to body list without removing any segments (since it's an apple move).
     - Now, the snake has another valid movement remaining as required.

Thus, the sequence of moves is DOWN followed by LEFT.

The directions are: DOWN, LEFT.
