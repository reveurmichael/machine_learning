 {
     "moves": ["LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
     "reasoning": "To avoid collision and remain continuous, we move 2 steps left (to position (3,8)) to create distance from the current head position, then move down twice (to position (3,6)) to approach the apple. This plan ensures safety by avoiding immediate self-collision and does not trap ourselves after eating the apple."
