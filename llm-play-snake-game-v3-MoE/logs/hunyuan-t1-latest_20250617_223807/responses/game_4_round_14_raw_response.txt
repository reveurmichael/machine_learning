========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move right once and up three times to reach the apple at (4,5). Starting from (3,2) with direction DOWN, moving RIGHT first avoids collision with the body (which is vertically aligned above the head). Subsequent UP moves navigate toward the apple, avoiding body segments. After reaching the apple, there is space to continue moving UP, ensuring no immediate trapping."
