========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

To solve this problem, we need to plan a sequence of moves for the snake to reach the apple while following all the movement rules and constraints. Let's analyze the current state:

1. Current head position: (6, 1)
2. Apple position: (7, 1)

The difference between these two positions is:
- X-axis: 7 - 6 = +1
- Y-axis: 1 - 1 = 0

So we need to move one unit to the right.

Let's check our constraints:
- We are moving DOWN currently, so we can't go UP on the first move.
- Our body position is (6, 2), which means if we go LEFT or DOWN, we'll collide with it.

Given these considerations:

1. From (6, 1) to (7, 1), we need to make one RIGHT move.
2. Since we can't reverse direction and the apple is directly right of our current position, moving RIGHT is both valid and safe.

Let's construct our JSON object:

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The apple is directly to the right of the snake head at (7,1). Moving RIGHT from (6,1) to (7,1) is a direct and safe path."
}
```

This plan ensures that we'll safely reach the apple without colliding with our body or going out of bounds.
