========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,5) with no body, so it can move freely. To reach (6,2), the head needs to move RIGHT once (x+1) and DOWN three times (y-3). Each step is checked for safety: moving RIGHT to (6,5), then DOWN to (6,4), (6,3), and finally (6,2) (apple). Since the snake has no body initially, no collisions occur. After eating the apple, the body grows to [(6,3)], leaving legal moves (e.g., LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) for the next turn."
