========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (8,2) to eat the apple at (8,5). The current direction is "RIGHT", and the body cells are [(7,2), (6,2), ..., (0,2), (0,3)]. 

First, I need to visualize the grid. The head is at (8,2), which is near the top-right corner. The apple is at (8,5), which is three units up in y-direction from the head's current position.

The body cells go all the way back to (0,3). That means the snake is currently long and covers most of the bottom row, but since it's going right, the tail is at (0,2) and then (0,3), which might complicate things.

Since the head is at (8,2) and direction is RIGHT, moving further right would take it out of bounds because x=9 is the maximum. So that's not possible. The apple is directly above in y-direction, so I need to figure a way to move up without colliding with the body.

Looking at the current body cells, after the head (8,2), the next is (7,2), then (6,2) all the way to (0,2). Then there's (0,3). So moving UP from the head would take it to (8,3). Is that safe? Let me check if (8,3) is part of any body cells. The body cells after the head are [(7,2), ...], so none have y=3 except maybe the tail's next position.

Wait, when moving up from (8,2), new_head becomes (8,3). Now, I need to check if this new_head collides with any BODYi except possibly the tail. The body cells are [(7,2), (6,2), ..., (0,2), (0,3)]. So none of these have y=3, except for (0,3), but that's only at x=0, so (8,3) is clear.

So moving UP is safe. But wait, the direction is currently RIGHT. The movement rules say you can't reverse direction immediately. Since current direction is RIGHT, next move cannot be LEFT. So moving UP or DOWN would be allowed because they're not reverses of RIGHT.

Wait no: the rules say that if current direction is RIGHT, you cannot choose LEFT next. Similarly for other opposite directions. So from RIGHT, possible next moves are UP, DOWN, but also perhaps RIGHT again (if it's allowed to continue same direction? Or does continuing same count as reverse?) Wait, I think the rule says you can't choose the opposite direction. So if current is RIGHT, you can't go LEFT, but other directions are allowed.

So from RIGHT, next move can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. But in this case, moving RIGHT would take head to (9,2), which is out of bounds because x must be less than 10. So moving right is impossible here. So the options are UP and DOWN.

But the apple is at (8,5), so I need to move up three times. Let's see:

First move: UP from (8,2) → (8,3). Safe as per earlier reasoning.

Second move: After moving UP once, the new head is (8,3). Now, what's the direction? The first move was UP, so next moves can't be DOWN because that would reverse. So from UP, I can choose UP, LEFT, or RIGHT again?

Wait no, current direction after first move becomes whatever we chose. Wait, in the movement update rules, when you make a move, the new direction is set to the chosen direction. So if I choose UP as the first move, then the next moves cannot be DOWN.

So for the second step, from (8,3), moving UP again would take head to (8,4). Is that safe? Let's check body cells after the first move:

After first move, the body is updated. The old head (8,2) becomes part of the body list. So the new body will be [ (8,2), (7,2), ... ] except when eating apple. But since we're not at the apple yet, the tail would have moved.

Wait no, in this first move, we're moving UP and not eating apple because the apple is at (8,5). So after first move:

Body becomes [old_head] + body list before, then remove the tail. So from original body [(7,2), (6,2), ..., (0,3)], adding 8,2 to front makes it [(8,2), (7,2), ...], and then we remove the last element (which is (0,3)). So new body after first move would be up to (1,2) perhaps? Not sure, but important to ensure that when moving again, the new head doesn't hit any of these.

So for second move UP from 8,3: check if (8,4) is in body. The body now includes (8,2), (7,2), ..., (1,2). None are at y=4, so it's safe.

Third move: Up again to (8,5), which is the apple. Now, when moving into the apple, we grow the body by not removing the tail.

But wait, I need to check if after eating the apple, the next move has a legal option. Because according to rules, after eating, there must be at least one legal move left.

So after moving up three times and eating the apple, what's the new state?

The snake would have grown by one, so its body is longer. Let me think about possible paths:

Alternatively, perhaps moving right isn't an option because it's out of bounds, but that was already considered.

Another thing: The initial direction is RIGHT, which means if I choose to move UP first, the next moves can be UP and LEFT or something else?

Wait, no: after choosing UP as the first move, the new direction is UP. So next moves cannot be DOWN. But in this case, moving up again would take us closer to the apple.

So possible moves: UP, UP, UP.

Let me check each step:

1. Move 1: RIGHT → can't choose LEFT.
Wait no, current direction is RIGHT; first move can't be LEFT. So from initial state, possible directions are UP and DOWN.

Wait initial direction is RIGHT. The movement rules say you cannot reverse direction on the first move. Reversing would mean choosing LEFT if current is RIGHT.

So in the initial move, possible choices are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT? Wait no: according to rule 2, "Cannot reverse": if current direction is RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT. So from RIGHT, you can choose UP, DOWN, or perhaps continue RIGHT again?

Wait, I think continuing same direction is allowed because reversing is only when going opposite.

So initial move options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.

But moving RIGHT would take head to (9,2), which is out of bounds—so it's invalid. So initial move must be either UP or DOWN.

If I choose UP:

- Move 1: UP → (8,3). Safe.
- Now direction is UP; next moves cannot be DOWN.

Move 2: Choose UP again → (8,4). Safe.

Move 3: Choose UP again → (8,5), which is the apple. This would result in eating the apple and growing the body without removing the tail.

But then after that, I need to ensure that there's at least one legal move next turn.

After eating, the snake's head is at (8,5). The direction is UP now. Next moves cannot be DOWN because current direction is UP.

Looking around, possible directions would be LEFT or RIGHT or maybe continue UP?

But since we are at y=5, moving up further would take us out of bounds (y must be <10), so UP again is allowed? Wait no: x and y go from 0 to9. So y=5 is within bounds.

Wait the grid is 10x10 with coordinates 0-9. So y can be from 0 to9, same for x.

So after moving up three times, the head is at (8,5). The body now includes all previous positions plus the new head and the old head becomes part of the body except when apple is eaten.

Wait no: upon eating the apple, we don't remove the tail. So in this case, moving UP three times would take us to the apple, but each move adds a segment at the front without removing the tail until the third move, where we eat and add without removing.

So after moving up three times:

- First move: (8,3), body grows by adding old head.
- Second move: (8,4), same logic.
- Third move: (8,5) → apple eaten. So body adds new head but doesn't remove tail.

Now, the snake's length is longer than before. But importantly, after eating, we need to make sure that from (8,5), there's at least one legal next move.

If the current direction is UP, then next possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT because DOWN would be reverse of UP? Wait no: from UP, you can't choose DOWN as it's reversing. So possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT.

But at (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) is invalid since x=9 is maximum but in a 10x10 grid, x can be up to 9 inclusive? Wait no, the coordinates go from 0-9, so 8 is okay. Moving right would take us to 9, which is allowed.

Wait wait: the initial move was RIGHT, but after moving UP three times, the direction became UP.

So in this scenario, after eating the apple at (8,5), the next possible directions are LEFT and RIGHT because you can't go DOWN (since current direction is UP and can't reverse to DOWN).

Moving LEFT from (8,5) would take us to (7,5). Is that position safe? Let's check body cells.

After three moves of UP:

The body after each move adds the previous head. So the body list would have:

First move: [ (8,2), ... ] but then added and tail removed.

Wait maybe I'm complicating it too much. The main point is that moving up three times gets us to the apple, which is the goal.

So the answer should be ["UP", "UP", "UP"], which as a JSON array would be [ "UP", "UP", "UP" ].
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine a sequence of moves for the snake starting from (8,2) to reach and eat the apple at (8,5). The snake cannot reverse its direction immediately after each move.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Position**: The snake's head is at (8,2), and it is moving right.
2. **Apple Location**: The target is (8,5), which is three units above the current head position in the y-direction.
3. **Movement Constraints**:
   - Moving right from (8,2) would take the head out of bounds as x cannot exceed 9.
   - From a given direction, you cannot reverse to the opposite direction immediately (e.g., moving left after moving right is not allowed).
4. **Possible Moves**: From the initial position with direction right, possible first moves are up or down.

### Solution:
The optimal path involves moving upwards three times to reach the apple at (8,5). Each move upwards is valid and does not conflict with any body segments since they do not occupy positions in the y=3, y=4, or y=5 rows except for the tail which moves away as the snake progresses.

### Answer:
```json
["UP", "UP", "UP"]
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (8, 2) and whose body cells are in list format [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (8, 5). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
