========== SECONDARY LLM PROMPT ==========

You are the secondary LLM in a Mixture-of-Experts system for a Snake game. Your job is to format the primary LLM's output into valid JSON.

Generate a valid JSON object from this Snake game primary LLM response (let's call it RESPONSE_1):

BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to help the snake get from (5,5) to eat the apple at (2,7). Let's break it down step by step.

First, the snake is currently at (5,5) and direction is NONE. The body cells are empty except for the head since the list is []. So, no blocking in the immediate vicinity. That means I can move freely without worrying about collisions right now.

Looking at the apple position (2,7), it's to the northwest of the head. To get there, the snake needs to make 3 steps left and 2 steps up. But since movement is grid-based, each step has to be carefully planned to avoid self-collisions.

Starting move: Let's consider moving LEFT first because that's towards reducing x-coordinate by 1 each time. So, direction "LEFT".

After moving LEFT once, the new head position would be (4,5). Now, check for any possible collisions or future issues. Since there are no body cells yet, just need to ensure movement is allowed.

Next move: Again, LEFT will take us closer. New head becomes (3,5). Still on track towards (2,7).

Third move: LEFT again would get us to (2,5), which is directly below the apple's y-coordinate of 7. Now, we need to start moving UP to reach the apple.

Fourth move: UP takes us from (2,5) to (2,6). Still not at the apple yet.

Fifth move: UP again brings us to (2,7), which is exactly where the apple is located. At this point, since the snake hasn't eaten anything except maybe the apple on the last move, but we just moved into it successfully. So, that's a safe path without any collision checks failing as long as each step didn't collide.

Wait, did I miss something? Oh right, when moving into the apple position, if there are no other body cells interfering (since the body is empty except for the head which moves to the new position), it should be fine. The snake will grow by 1 because it ate the apple, so the body length increases but in this case, since the initial direction was none and we can make a move without worrying about the tail not moving.

Also, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn to avoid immediate trapping. But since each step here is safe, it should be okay.
</think>

To navigate from (5,5) safely to (2,7), we plan moves left and then up without colliding with any body cells or itself.

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move LEFT three times to decrease x-coordinate from 5 to 2, then move UP twice to increase y-coordinate from 5 to 7. This avoids any self-collisions and the apple is within reach without blocking the path."
}
```
```

END OF RESPONSE_1.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (2, 7). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
