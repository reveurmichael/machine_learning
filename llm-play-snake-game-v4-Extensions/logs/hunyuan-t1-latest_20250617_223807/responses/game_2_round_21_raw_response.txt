"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,0) with a body blocking direct rightward movement. To reach the apple at (4,4), the snake first moves up along the left edge (x=0) to avoid collision with its body, then moves right to (4,9), and finally down to (4,4). This path ensures no collisions with the body or walls, and after eating the apple, there are legal moves available."
