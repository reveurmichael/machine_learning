========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 4 units right (to reach x=7) and 2 units up (to reach y=6). Starting with UP avoids reversing the initial LEFT direction and moves toward the apple's y-coordinate. Subsequent RIGHT moves navigate horizontally toward the apple, avoiding the snake's body which lies below (y=4) and to the right (x=7, y=3). Each move is checked for collisions with the body, confirming safety. After reaching the apple, there are valid next moves (e.g., UP, RIGHT, DOWN) ensuring no immediate trapping."
