```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "UP", "LEFT", "RIGHT", "LEFT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move UP twice to reach the apple's y-coordinate (from 2 to 0). Since the x-coordinates are the same, no LEFT or RIGHT moves are necessary. However, to avoid the body at (6, 3) after the first move, a detour is planned. The sequence ensures the snake avoids collisions and reaches the apple safely."
}
``` 

Wait, no. Let me reanalyze carefully.

The snake's head is at (6, 2), and the apple is at (6, 0). The current direction is DOWN, so the first move cannot be UP (opposite direction). However, the next moves can be UP to move toward the apple. The body is at (6, 3), which is directly above the head after one UP move. Therefore, the snake cannot move UP immediately because it would collide with its body. 

Instead, the snake must first move LEFT or RIGHT to avoid the body, then move UP. Here's the corrected plan:

1. Move LEFT to (5, 2) to avoid the body.
2. Move UP to (5, 3).
3. Move LEFT to (4, 3) to create space.
4. Move UP to (4, 4).
5. Move RIGHT to (5, 4), then continue adjusting to reach the apple.

Wait, this is getting too long. Let me rethink.

The snake's head is at (6, 2), and the apple is at (6, 0). The body is at (6, 3). The snake cannot move UP directly because it would collide with the body at (6, 3). Therefore, the snake must first move LEFT or RIGHT to avoid the body, then move UP.

Here's a better plan:

1. Move LEFT to (5, 2).
2. Move UP to (5, 3).
3. Move LEFT to (4, 3).
4. Move UP to (4, 4).
5. Move RIGHT to (5, 4).
6. Move RIGHT to (6, 4).
7. Move UP to (6, 5). Wait, this is going away from the apple.

This approach isn't working. Let me try another way.

Alternative plan:

1. Move RIGHT to (7, 2).
2. Move UP to (7, 3).
3. Move LEFT to (6, 3) – but this is the body, so invalid.

No, this also fails.

Another approach:

1. Move LEFT to (5, 2).
2. Move UP to (5, 3).
3. Move LEFT to (4, 3).
4. Move UP to (4, 4).
5. Move RIGHT to (5, 4).
6. Move RIGHT to (6, 4).
7. Move DOWN to (6, 3) – but this is the body.

This is not working. It seems impossible to reach the apple without colliding with the body in the first few moves.

Wait, let me check the Manhattan distance. The apple is at (6, 0), and the head is at (6, 2). The snake needs to move UP twice. However, after the first UP move, the head would be at (6, 3), which is the body. Therefore, the snake cannot reach the apple without colliding.

Thus, no safe path exists.

Final answer:

```json
{
  "moves": [],
  "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND"
}
