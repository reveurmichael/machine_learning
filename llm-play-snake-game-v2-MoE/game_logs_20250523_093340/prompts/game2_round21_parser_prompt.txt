<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The snake's head is at (4, 0), and it's currently moving DOWN. The body segments are [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], so the snake is moving downward from the head. The apple is at (8,6), which is to the right and above the head.

First, I need to figure out the path from (4,0) to (8,6) without colliding with the body or the walls. Since the snake is moving DOWN, the next move can't be UP (because reversing direction is not allowed). So the first move can be RIGHT, LEFT, or DOWN. But since the head is at (4,0), moving DOWN would take it to (4,-1), which is outside the grid. That's invalid. So the first move can't be DOWN. Therefore, the first move must be either RIGHT or LEFT.

But the apple is at (8,6), which is to the right. So moving RIGHT seems logical. Let's check if moving RIGHT is safe. The current body is in column 4, rows 0 to 4. Wait, the head is at (4,0), and the body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. So the body is directly above the head. So if the snake moves RIGHT, the new head would be at (5,0). Then, the body would shift: the next position would be (4,0), then (4,1), etc. But since the body is in column 4, moving right would take the head to (5,0), which is not overlapping with the body. So that's safe.

So first move RIGHT. Then, the head is at (5,0). Next, we need to move towards the apple. The apple is at (8,6), which is 3 steps right (from 5 to 8) and 6 steps up (from 0 to 6). But we have to be careful not to hit the body. Let's think about the movement path.

But the snake's body is in column 4, rows 0 to 4. Wait, the head is at (4,0), and the body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. So when the snake moves, the body shifts. For example, if the head moves RIGHT to (5,0), the body segments will shift: the next segment becomes (4,0), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and the tail (4,4) is removed. Wait, no. The body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. So the head is at (4,0). When the snake moves, the new head is added, and the tail is removed unless the apple is eaten. Since the apple hasn't been eaten yet, the tail (the last body segment) is removed.

So after moving RIGHT once, the new head is (5,0). The body becomes [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]? Wait, no. Let me think again. The body is a list of positions, excluding the head. The movement process is: new head is calculated, then the body is updated. The original body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. So when the head moves to (5,0), the new body becomes [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]? Wait, no. The body is the list of positions that the snake's body occupies, excluding the head. The snake's body is the segments that follow the head. So when the head moves, the body shifts. The original body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], which means the head is at (4,0), and the next segment is (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Wait, no, that can't be right. If the head is at (4,0), and the body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], then the body is in the order from the head's next position. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the head is moving down, and the body is following. So the body segments are behind the head. So if the head is at (4,0), and the body is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)], but the given body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. That would mean the body is in reverse order. Hmm, perhaps the body list is given in the order from the head's next position to the tail. So the head is at (4,0), and the body is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]? But the input says the body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. That seems like the list is ordered from the tail to the head. So the head is at (4,0), and the body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], which would be the tail at (4,4), then the next segment at (4,3), etc., up to (4,1), which is right behind the head. So the body is in a vertical line from (4,1) up to (4,4). So the head is at (4,0), and the body is from (4,1) up to (4,4). So if the head moves right to (5,0), the new body would be [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)], because the body shifts forward. Wait, no. When the head moves, the body shifts. The original body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. So the head is at (4,0), and the body is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]? That seems like the body is in the order from the head's next position. But the input lists the body as [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], which is in reverse order. So maybe the body is stored in reverse order. So when the head moves, the body segments shift. So after moving right, the new head is (5,0), and the body becomes [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]? That seems possible. But this might be complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the body is a list of positions that the snake's body occupies, excluding the head. So when the snake moves, the head moves, and the body shifts. For example, if the head is at (4,0) and the body is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)], then moving right to (5,0) would make the new body [(4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)], and the tail (4,4) is removed. But the input body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], which is the reverse. So perhaps the body is stored in the order from the tail to the head. So the original body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], meaning the tail is at (4,4), and the head is at (4,0), with the body segments in between. So when the head moves, the body shifts. So moving right, the new head is (5,0), and the body becomes [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,0)], but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me focus on the movement. The key thing is that the snake can't collide with its body. So after moving right once, the head is at (5,0). The body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], but the head is at (4,0). So when the head moves to (5,0), the body will be updated. The body is the list of positions that the snake's body occupies, excluding the head. So the original body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. The head is at (4,0). When the head moves to (5,0), the new head is (5,0), and the body becomes [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]. Wait, that seems like the body is now [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)], but that would mean the body is in positions (4,0), (4,4), etc., which might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the body is updated by adding the previous head position to the front and removing the last element. So the original body is [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. The head moves to (5,0). The new body is [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)], and the tail (4,1) is removed. Wait, but the original body had four elements. If the head moves, the body should have the same number of elements unless the apple is eaten. Since the apple hasn't been eaten, the body length remains the same. So after moving, the body should be [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]. So the head is at (5,0), and the body is [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]. So the body is now in positions (4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). So the body is now in (4,0), which is the previous head position, and then (4,4), etc. But that seems like the body is not in a straight line anymore. However, the main point is that the new head position (5,0) is not overlapping with any of the body positions. The body positions after the move are [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]. So (5,0) is not in that list. So that's safe.

So moving right once is safe. Now, the head is at (5,0). Next, the snake needs to move towards the apple. The apple is at (8,6). From (5,0), moving right three times would take the head to (8,0), then up six times to (8,6). But we need to make sure that during this movement, the snake doesn't collide with its body.

But let's think about the body positions after each move. Let's simulate the movement step by step.

Initial state after first move (RIGHT):

Head: (5,0)

Body: [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]

Now, the next move. The snake is moving right, so the next move can't be left (since the current direction is RIGHT). But the next move can be up, down, or right again. However, the apple is at (8,6), so moving up would be towards the apple. Let's consider the path.

But perhaps it's better to move right until the head reaches (8,0), then move up. Let's see if that's possible.

From (5,0), moving right three times to reach (8,0). Let's simulate each move.

Move 2: RIGHT → (6,0)

Body after move 2: [(5,0), (4,0), (4,4), (4,3)]

Check if (6,0) is in the body? The body is [(5,0), (4,0), (4,4), (4,3)]. So (6,0) is not in the body. Safe.

Move 3: RIGHT → (7,0)

Body after move 3: [(6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (4,4)]

No collision.

Move 4: RIGHT → (8,0)

Body after move 4: [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)]

No collision. Now, the head is at (8,0). Now, need to move up six times to reach (8,6). Let's check each step.

Move 5: UP → (8,1)

Body after move 5: [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)]

No collision.

Move 6: UP → (8,2)

Body: [(8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0)]

No collision.

Move 7: UP → (8,3)

Body: [(8,2), (8,1), (8,0), (7,0)]

No collision.

Move 8: UP → (8,4)

Body: [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)]

No collision.

Move 9: UP → (8,5)

Body: [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]

No collision.

Move 10: UP → (8,6)

Now, the head is at the apple position. At this point, the snake eats the apple, so the body doesn't shrink. The body after this move would be [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)]. Wait, but the original body after move 4 was [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)]. Then, after each move up, the body shifts. But when the apple is eaten, the body length increases by 1. However, the problem is that after the snake reaches the apple, the body would have an extra segment. However, in the simulation above, the movement from (8,0) to (8,6) would take six moves, each time moving up. But the body after each move would shift, and since the apple is eaten at the final move, the body length increases by 1. However, the main concern is that during the movement to the apple, the snake doesn't collide with its body.

But let's check if during the movement up, the head is colliding with the body. For example, after move 5, the head is at (8,1), and the body is [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)]. No collision. Then move 6: head at (8,2), body [(8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0)]. No collision. Similarly, all moves up would not collide with the body, since the body is in the lower y positions, and the head is moving up. So this seems safe.

However, the problem is that the snake is moving in a straight line, and the body is following. But when the head is moving up, the body is moving forward, so the body segments are in the positions behind the head. So there's no collision. Therefore, this path seems safe.

But let's check the movement again. The initial moves are right three times, then up six times. That's 3 + 6 = 9 moves. Starting from the initial position, the first move is right, then 8 more moves (total 9 moves) to reach the apple. However, the problem is that when the snake reaches the apple, the body is extended, but that's okay.

However, there's a problem: when the head is at (8,0), the body is [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)]. Then, moving up, the body shifts. So after moving up once, the body becomes [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)], and the head is at (8,1). Then, moving up again, the body becomes [(8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0)], and the head is at (8,2). This continues, and the body is always one step behind the head in the y-direction, so there's no collision.

But wait, when the head is moving up, the body is moving forward. So the body is in the same x-coordinate (8) but lower y. So the head is at (8, y), and the body is at (8, y-1), (8, y-2), etc. So there's no collision.

Therefore, this path is safe. However, the problem is that when the head is at (8,0), the body is [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)], which are all in the same y-coordinate (0), but lower x. So the head is at (8,0), and the body segments are at x=7,6,5,4. So no collision here.

So this seems to work. However, there's another thing to consider: the initial movement. The first move was right from (4,0) to (5,0). Then, moving right again to (6,0), (7,0), (8,0). Then up six times. So the total moves are 1 (initial right) + 3 (to reach (8,0)) + 6 (up) = 10 moves? Wait, initial state is after first move (RIGHT). Then, from (5,0), moving right three times to (8,0) would take three moves (moves 2,3,4). Then, moving up six times (moves 5-10). So total of 10 moves. But the problem is that the initial move is the first move.

But the user hasn't specified any constraints on the number of moves, just that the snake must reach the apple without colliding. So this path seems valid.

However, there's a problem: when the snake is moving right from (5,0) to (8,0), the body after each move is [(4,0), ...], etc. Wait, no. Let me re-simulate the body after each move.

Initial state: head at (4,0), body [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]

Move 1: RIGHT → head (5,0). Body becomes [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]

Move 2: RIGHT → head (6,0). Body becomes [(5,0), (4,0), (4,4), (4,3)]

Move 3: RIGHT → head (7,0). Body becomes [(6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (4,4)]

Move 4: RIGHT → head (8,0). Body becomes [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)]

So after move 4, the head is at (8,0), and the body is [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)]. Now, moving up:

Move 5: UP → (8,1). Body becomes [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)]

Move 6: UP → (8,2). Body becomes [(8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0)]

Move 7: UP → (8,3). Body becomes [(8,2), (8,1), (8,0), (7,0)]

Move 8: UP → (8,4). Body becomes [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)]

Move 9: UP → (8,5). Body becomes [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]

Move 10: UP → (8,6). Body becomes [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)] (since the apple is eaten, the body length increases by 1).

So at move 10, the head is at (8,6), which is the apple. This path seems safe. The snake never collides with its body during the movement.

But there's a problem: when the snake is moving up from (8,0) to (8,6), the body is [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)] after move 4. Then, during move 5, the body becomes [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)]. So the body is now in positions (8,0), (7,0), etc. But the head is at (8,1). So no collision. Similarly, all subsequent moves are safe.

Therefore, this path is valid.

However, there's another possibility: what if the snake moves up earlier? For example, after moving right once, move up. But that might cause a collision with the body.

Let me check. Suppose after move 1 (head at (5,0)), move up to (5,1). Body after move 2: [(5,0), (4,0), (4,4), (4,3)]. Head at (5,1). No collision with body. Then move right again. But this might be more complicated. However, the initial plan of moving right to (8,0) then up seems straightforward and safe.

Another possible issue: when the snake reaches the apple, the body is extended, but that's okay because the apple is eaten.

Therefore, the path is valid. The sequence of moves would be:

1. RIGHT → (5,0)

2. RIGHT → (6,0)

3. RIGHT → (7,0)

4. RIGHT → (8,0)

5. UP → (8,1)

6. UP → (8,2)

7. UP → (8,3)

8. UP → (8,4)

9. UP → (8,5)

10. UP → (8,6)

Total of 10 moves.

But the problem is that the user might want the minimal number of moves, but the question doesn't specify that. It just asks for a valid path.

However, there's another possible path that might be shorter or safer. For example, moving diagonally. But the snake can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right), not diagonally. So the only options are the four directions.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can move up earlier. But let's think about that.

After the first move (RIGHT to (5,0)), the snake could move up, but then it would have to navigate around its body. However, the body is at [(4,0), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]. So moving up to (5,1) is safe. Then, moving right again to (6,1), etc. But this would complicate the path and might not be shorter.

The initial plan seems the most straightforward.

Another possible issue: the body after move 4 is [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)]. So when the head is at (8,0), the body is at (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0). So the head is at (8,0), and the body is at (7,0), etc. No collision here. Then, when moving up, the body shifts forward.

Therefore, this path is safe.

Thus, the answer is that the snake can move right four times to reach (8,0), then up six times to reach the apple at (8,6).
</think>

To solve the problem of navigating the snake from its starting position to the apple without colliding with its own body, we can follow a systematic approach that ensures the snake moves in a safe and unambiguous path.

---

### **Problem Summary**

- The snake begins at position **(4, 0)**.
- The apple is located at **(8, 6)**.
- The snake can move in **four directions**: **up, down, left, right**.
- The snake cannot move into a position that is already occupied by its body.
- The goal is to reach the apple without any collision.

---

### **Solution Strategy**

A safe and minimal path can be constructed by:

1. **Moving right** from **(4, 0)** to **(8, 0)** (a total of **4 moves**).
2. **Moving up** from **(8, 0)** to **(8, 6)** (a total of **6 moves**).

This results in a total of **10 moves**.

### **Step-by-Step Path**

| Move | Direction | Position | Body Segments (after move) |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------------------|
| 1    | Right     | (5, 0)   | [(4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)] |
| 2    | Right     | (6, 0)   | [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 3)] |
| 3    | Right     | (7, 0)   | [(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 4)] |
| 4    | Right     | (8, 0)   | [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)] |
| 5    | Up        | (8, 1)   | [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0)] |
| 6    | Up        | (8, 2)   | [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)] |
| 7    | Up        | (8, 3)   | [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)] |
| 8    | Up        | (8, 4)   | [(8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)] |
| 9    | Up        | (8, 5)   | [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1)] |
| 10   | Up        | (8, 6)   | [(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)] |

---

### **Conclusion**

The snake can successfully reach the apple located at **(8, 6)** by moving **right four times** to **(8, 0)** and then **up six times** to **(8, 6)**. This path ensures that the snake never collides with its own body and reaches the goal in **10 moves**.
