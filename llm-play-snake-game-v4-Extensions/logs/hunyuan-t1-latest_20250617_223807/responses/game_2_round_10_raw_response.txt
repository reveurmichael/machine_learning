========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (0,9) with direction LEFT. First, moving DOWN avoids grid boundaries and body collisions. After 5 DOWN moves, the head reaches (0,4). Then, moving RIGHT 5 times navigates to the apple at (5,4). Each step checks for safe positions, avoiding body segments and grid edges. After eating the apple, the snake's length increases, and there are legal moves available (e.g., UP, DOWN, RIGHT), ensuring no immediate trapping."
