Let's analyze the current game state and plan a safe path to the apple at (7, 5):

Current head position: (0, 8) facing UP
Apple position: (7, 5)
Snake body segment at (1, 8)

Constraints:
1. Cannot move DOWN (opposite of current UP direction)
2. Must avoid walls and body segments
3. Need to navigate around the board to reach lower left area

Safe moves from current position (0,8):
- LEFT (would move to (0,7))
- RIGHT (would hit wall at (0,9))
- UP (would hit wall at (-1,8))

Best immediate move is LEFT to (0,7), then we can start descending.

Here's a 10-move sequence to reach the apple:

1. LEFT
2. DOWN
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. LEFT
6. LEFT
7. LEFT
8. DOWN
9. DOWN
10. DOWN

This path:
- Starts by moving left to avoid immediate wall collision
- Then moves down the left side of the board
- Turns left at row 3 to cross toward the apple
- Finally moves down to reach the apple at (7,5)

The snake will avoid its own body and walls throughout this path. After move 10, the head will be at the apple position (7,5).
