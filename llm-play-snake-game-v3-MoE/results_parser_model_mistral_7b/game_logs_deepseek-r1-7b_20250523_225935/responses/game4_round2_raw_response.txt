========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to solve this Snake game problem. The goal is to help the snake navigate from its current position to the apple at (8,9) without dying. Let's break down what we know.

The snake's head is at (6,5), moving right. The body is just [(5,5)], which means it's a single cell behind the head. The apple is way up at (8,9). 

First, I need to plan the moves step by step. Since the direction is RIGHT, but we're one unit away from where that move would take us, maybe moving right isn't immediately helpful because it could block our path later.

Looking at the current position, moving left or down might be safer initially. Let's consider moving up first. But wait, (6,5) to (6,6). That should be safe as long as there's no body blocking. Since the body is only at (5,5), which is directly behind the head but not in the path.

So, move UP. Now the head moves from (6,5) to (6,4). The new head becomes (6,4), and the body list shifts—inserting (6,5) as the new first body segment. Since we didn't eat the apple, we remove the tail. But wait, in this case, the snake was only length 2 before moving, so after moving, it's still just two cells.

Next move: heading towards the apple at (8,9). The apple is northeast of the head now. Let me consider possible directions—right or up again? Maybe right first since that seems to be progress in x-direction.

From (6,4), moving RIGHT takes us to (7,4). Check if this cell is clear—it should be empty unless occupied by body cells after shift. Since before the move, the snake was [(6,5), (5,5)], but now it's [(6,4), (6,5)]. Wait, no—the tail would have been at (5,5) and moved to (6,5). So when moving right from (7,4), it won't conflict.

So move RIGHT: head becomes (7,4). Now the body list is [ (7,4), (6,4) ] after inserting old head. But since we didn't eat apple, tail moves from (6,5) to (7,5). Wait no—the initial body was [(5,5)]. When moving up and then right, I need to make sure the movement is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again: each move, new_head is calculated first. Then before any shifts, check for collisions with existing body except tail if necessary.

So after moving up from (6,5) to (6,4), we need to update the body by inserting head at front and removing tail. So new body becomes [(6,4), (6,5)] but since it's length 2, no removal of tail happens because we didn't eat apple.

Wait, initial body is [ (5,5) ], which is behind the head (6,5). After moving up to (6,4), insert old head at front: new body list becomes [(6,5), (5,5)]? Wait no—the initial snake was S = [ (6,5), (5,5) ] as per input. So when we move UP:

new_head is (6,4). Insert that into the front of the body list. Then remove the tail if necessary.

Wait, no: according to rule 3a and 3b. 

If new_head is not apple, then it's "move normally": insert old head at front, remove tail.

So initial S was [ (6,5), (5,5) ]. After moving UP:

new_head = (6,4). Insert into body list: now the body becomes [(6,4), (6,5)]. Then remove tail. The tail is from before shift—was at (5,5)? Wait no—the initial S was [ head= (6,5), body1=(5,5) ]. So when moving UP:

Insert new_head = (6,4) as the new head. Then, since we didn't eat apple, remove the tail (which is still (5,5)).

So now the snake becomes [(6,4), (6,5)] with body1=(6,5). Is that correct? Wait no: inserting new_head at front and removing last element would make it [ (6,4), (6,5) ] because we had two elements before. So after moving UP:

S = [ (6,4) (head), (6,5) ]

Wait but the body1 was originally (5,5). Now when inserting new_head at front and removing tail, which was (5,5)—so is that correct?

Hmm, maybe I got confused with how the snake shifts. Let me recall rule 3: update body positions.

Assuming no collision:

a) Insert old head position at front of BODY list. So S becomes [new_head] + previous_body_list

b) If not eating apple, remove tail (last element).

So in our case, after moving UP:

new_head = (6,4). The previous_body was [(5,5)]. Now inserting new_head: body list is [(6,4), (5,5)]. Then since no apple eaten, we need to remove the last element. So final S becomes [ (6,4), (6,5) ].

Wait, that can't be right because then the tail would have been moved from (5,5) to where? Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving:

The new snake is created by inserting new_head at front and removing last element if not eating apple. So initial S was [ (6,5), (5,5) ]

After moving UP:

new_head = (6,4)

Insert into front: [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]

Wait no—the snake's body is in a list where the order represents from behind to head. So before movement, it was [head=H, body1=B1, body2=B2,... tail=T]. When moving, new_head becomes H', and we insert H' at front, then if not eating apple, remove T.

So for initial S: [ (6,5) , (5,5) ]

After moving UP:

new_head = (6,4)

Insert into front: [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ] ?

But the body length was 2. So now after inserting H', which is one more element? Or no.

Wait rules say in step 3a and 3b:

Step 3:
a. Insert old head at front of BODY list → new body = [new_head] + current_body
b. If not eating apple, remove last element (tail)

So if initial body was length N, after a it's N+1, then step b removes one, so overall N.

But in our case:

Initial S has length 2: head=H=(6,5), body1=B1=(5,5). So current_body = [B1]. When moving UP:

a. Insert H_new at front → new_body_list = [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

But wait that's only two elements. Then since we didn't eat apple, step 3b: remove last element.

So final S becomes [ (6,4), (6,5) ] ?

Wait no—that would make the body list now of length 1. But initial was [H,B1], and after moving, insert H' at front → [H', H] then if not eating apple, remove tail: so [H'] remains as head, but body becomes empty? No.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that the snake's body list is a list of segments from behind (tail) to head. So initial S = [head=(6,5), body1=(5,5)]. After moving up:

new_head = (6,4)

Insert new_head at front: so [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]

But this is now 3 elements? Wait no—the initial was two elements. So after inserting H', we have three. Then if not eating apple, remove the last element—so final body list becomes [ (6,4), (6,5) ].

So new S is [head=(6,4), body1=(6,5)].

Wait that seems incorrect because in this case, the tail was at (5,5). So when moving up from (6,5), which was behind the head, then inserting H' and removing T would result in a shorter snake. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

I think it's better to follow rule 3 as written: insert new_head into front of current body list, making the new body one longer by one element (including the new head), then if not eating apple, remove last element.

So initial S = [H=(6,5), B1=(5,5)] → length=2

After moving up:

new_head = (6,4)

Insert into front: new_body becomes [ (6,4), 6,5 ), (5,5) ]? No—it should be inserting H' before the current body. So it's a list that now has three elements.

But then rule 3b says to remove last element if not eating apple. So after inserting, length is 3; removing one gives back to length=2: [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Wait no—if initial was two, insert makes it three, so after step b, it becomes two again.

So final S = [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Meaning the body list is [(6,5)] now? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused with how the snake shifts. It's tricky because when you move forward, each part of the body follows the previous one. So inserting new_head at front and removing last element.

So in any case, after moving up:

H becomes (6,4), B1=(6,5)

Because we're only two segments before movement, so adding H' makes it three, but then remove T to get back to two: [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Okay, that seems consistent.

Now next step is moving towards the apple. The current head is at (6,4). Let's plan a right move to (7,4).

Check for collision with existing body—head was moved from (6,5) → new head at (7,4), which shouldn't conflict as long as it's empty.

So step 3a: insert H'=(7,4) into front of current_body = [ (6,5) ] → new_body becomes [ (7,4), (6,5) ]

Since we didn't eat apple, step 3b: remove last element. So S becomes [ (7,4), (6,4) ]

Wait that seems odd—the snake's body is now two segments again.

This process might take a lot of steps to reach the apple. Maybe an alternative approach would be better—planning all possible moves and ensuring each step doesn't block progress towards the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps making some moves left or down first could create more space for later movements.

But since moving right is directly towards the x-coordinate needed for (8,9), maybe it's best to proceed along that path as much as possible without backtracking.

Wait, but after a few steps, when you're at (7,4), and so on—each step will only move x or y by one. So we need 2 more right moves from there: (7,4) →(8,4); then maybe up to (8,5), etc., until reaching (8,9).

But perhaps we can find a direct path.

Alternatively, since the apple is at (8,9)—which is in the top-right corner—maybe moving right as much as possible, but also making upward moves when necessary.

Given that starting position is near x=6, and y=5. To reach (8,9), need to move 2 units right on x-axis and 4 up on y.

But given snake's body may block the path, perhaps making a U-turn at certain points could be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe moving left first to create space behind—no, since we're already in position where moving left would take us back towards (6,5), which is our previous spot. 

Perhaps planning each move step by step and ensuring that no collision occurs with any body cells except the tail when necessary.

Let me try writing down a plan:

Current head: (6,4)
Body list after first move up: [ (6,5) ]

Next moves towards right (toward x=8):

Move RIGHT to (7,4). Check for collisions. Since current_body is [(6,5)], no collision.

Insert new_head=(7,4) into front → body becomes [ (7,4), (6,5) ]. Remove tail if not eating apple—yes, so final S = [ (7,4), (7,5) ]?

Wait that might be the case. Wait initial after moving up:

S was [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Now move right: new_head=(7,4). Insert into front → body becomes [ (7,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]. Then step 3b: since not eating apple, remove last element.

So final S is [ (7,4), (6,4) ]

Wait, that seems odd because the tail was at (6,5). So now after moving right, inserting H', we have three elements. Remove the last one—now body list has two again: [ (7,4), (6,4) ]

So head is (7,4), and body1=(6,4).

This suggests that when you move forward in a direction where the path is blocked by your own tail, it could cause confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps this indicates I need to reconsider how the snake shifts. Maybe each time you move, the new head is inserted at front, then if not eating apple, tail is removed from end.

Thus, after inserting H', length increases by one; step 3b removes last element (tail) only once per movement—so overall, net change is zero unless body list was empty or something's wrong.

Wait no—the initial S has two elements. After moving up:

current_body = [ (6,5) ]

After move up: insert H'=(6,4), making new_body_list = [ (6,4), 6,5 ] → length=2

Then step3b: remove last element because not eating apple.

Final S is [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Wait that's similar to before. So when moving up from H=(6,5) with body at T=(5,5):

Inserting H'=(6,4): new_body becomes [ (6,4), 6,5 ) ] → then remove last element: S = [ (6,4) ]

Wait no—that can't be because the snake must have a tail.

I think I'm getting stuck in how to manage the body list. Maybe it's better to represent each movement step-by-step with concrete examples.

Let me try:

Initial state:
S = [ (6,5), (5,5) ] → head=H=(6,5), body1=B1=(5,5)

Move UP from H: new_head = (6,4)
Insert into front of current_body ([B1])→ new_body_list becomes [ (6,4), B1=(5,5) ]
Since not eating apple, remove last element → S now is [ (6,4), B1=(6,5) ]? No, that can't be.

Wait no—after inserting H' at front: the body list is [H', H] = [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Then step3b says to remove last element if not eating apple. So we have two elements, remove one → final S is [ (6,4) ]? That can't be.

Wait no—the initial was length=2: after inserting, becomes 3, then removing one gives back 2—so the new S would be [ H'=(6,4), B1=(6,5) ]

So yes. So head is now (6,4), body list has two elements: [(6,5), (6,4)]?

Wait that seems inconsistent because in reality, each part of the snake follows.

This might take a while to get straight.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better not to track the entire body but just focus on head movement and ensure no collision with any cells except tail when necessary.

But since rules require checking the new_head against existing body (except for possible apple), I think we need to consider each step carefully.

Maybe try to outline all moves required:

From initial position, snake is [ (6,5) , (5,5) ]

We need to get to (8,9). So let's see how many steps are needed. The Manhattan distance from head to apple is |Δx| + |Δy|= 2+4=6 steps.

But considering the body and possible blocking, maybe it would take more than that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to plan each step carefully:

First move: UP → (6,4)

Then next moves towards east.

But wait let me see if after moving up, can I proceed east safely?

After first move Up: head is at (6,4), body list is [ (6,5) ]

Now, next move is RIGHT to (7,4). Check:

Current_body = [ (6,5) ]

Insert new_head=(7,4): new_body_list becomes [ (7,4), 6,5 ) ]

Since not eating apple: remove last element → S now is [ (7,4), (6,4) ]

Now head is at (7,4)

Next move: RIGHT again to (8,4). Current_body = [(6,4)]

Insert new_head=(8,4): new_body_list becomes [ (8,4), 7,4 ) ]

Not eating apple: remove last → S now is [ (8,4), (7,4) ]

Now head at (8,4)

Next move: UP to (8,5). Current_body = [(7,4)]

Insert new_head=(8,5): new_body_list becomes [ (8,5), 8,4 ) ]

Not eating apple: remove last → S now is [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Now head at (8,5)

Next move: UP to (8,6). Current_body = [(8,4)]

Insert new_head=(8,6): body becomes [ (8,6), 8,5 )

Remove last → S now is [ (8,6), (8,5) ]

Head at (8,6)

Next move: UP again to (8,7). Current_body = [(8,5)]

Insert new_head=(8,7): body becomes [ (8,7), 8,6 )

Remove last → S now is [ (8,7), (8,6) ]

Head at (8,7)

Next move: UP again to (8,8). Current_body = [(8,6)]

Insert new_head=(8,8): body becomes [ (8,8), 8,7 )

Remove last → S now is [ (8,8), (8,7) ]

Head at (8,8)

Now next move: RIGHT to (9,8). But the apple is at (8,9). So maybe first we need to go north.

From (8,8), moving UP would be to (8,9)—the apple! If we can do that without collision.

But let's check:

Move UP from (8,8) → new_head=(8,7)

Wait no—if head is at (8,8), moving up would make it (8,9). 

So step-by-step:

Current position: H=(8,8), body list = [ (8,7) ]

Move UP: new_head=(8,9). Insert into front → body becomes [ (8,9), 8,8 ) ].

Since this is the apple's location—if it's not yet eaten—but in our case, we haven't moved towards it yet. So if moving to (8,9) would result in eating the apple? Or wait—apple is at (8,9). If we move there without being blocked by body cells (except possibly tail), then perhaps.

But currently, after inserting H'=(8,9): new_body_list = [ (8,9), 8,8 ]

Since it's not our turn to eat the apple yet, unless this movement leads directly into it. Wait—maybe moving UP from H=(8,8) would have us at (8,9). 

But in this case, we're inserting H' and then removing the tail only if necessary.

Wait after move up:

new_body = [ (8,9), 8,8 ]

Since not eating apple: remove last element → S becomes [ (8,9) ]

So head is now at (8,9)—the apple! So we've successfully eaten it.

Wait but this seems too easy. How many moves did that take?

Let's recount:

Initial position:
- Head at (6,5), body at (5,5)

1st move: UP → (6,4); S becomes [ (6,4) , (6,5) ]

2nd move: RIGHT → (7,4); S becomes [ (7,4) , (6,4) ]

3rd move: RIGHT → (8,4); S becomes [ (8,4), (7,4) ]

4th move: UP → (8,5); S becomes [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

5th move: UP → (8,6); S becomes [ (8,6), (8,5) ]

6th move: UP → (8,7); S becomes [ (8,7), (8,6) ]

7th move: UP → (8,8); S becomes [ (8,8), (8,7) ]

8th move: UP → (8,9); S becomes [ (8,9), 8,8 ] → remove last element because not eating apple? Wait no—because we moved into the apple's location.

Wait wait—if in step 8, moving up leads to H'=(8,9). Since it's the apple's cell, perhaps that counts as eating it. So maybe when you move into (8,9), regardless of body position, if it was empty and the head can go there without collision, then eat.

But according to rules:

After step 3a: insert new_head at front

Then check for collision—if not in current_body except possibly tail; but since we're moving towards apple, perhaps it's allowed?

Alternatively, movement is blocked only if cell is occupied by body cells other than the last one. Since after inserting H', which is (8,9), and before removing tail—then step 3c says that as long as no collision with any except possibly the final step.

But in this case, moving up would result in new_head=(8,9). The current_body is [ (8,7) ]. So does it collide? No. Then after inserting H', which is empty cell, so we can move there without issue.

Then since (8,9) is the apple's position—if it was not already occupied by body—then moving into it would eat the apple. 

Wait but if current_body before movement was [ (8,7) ], and new_head becomes (8,9), which doesn't collide with any in current_body except possibly the last one.

But since we're moving to a new cell that's empty, I think this is allowed.

So after step 3a: body list becomes [ (8,9), (8,7) ]

Then step 3b: since not eating apple yet, remove tail → S now is [ (8,9) ]

Thus, head at (8,9)—success!

Wait so total moves:

From initial position to reach (8,9): moving right twice and then up six times—total of eight moves.

But in the process above, each time we moved RIGHT once or UP multiple times, but let me count properly.

Let's break down each move step-by-step with correct S changes:

Initial State:
S = [ (6,5) , (5,5) ]

Move 1: UP
new_head=(6,4)
body after insert: [ (6,4), (6,5) ]
since not eating apple, remove tail → S becomes [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Wait this seems to have swapped. So initial position is H=(6,5), body B1= (5,5). After moving up, new_head = (6,4). Insert into front: [ (6,4), 6,5 ). Then remove tail → S becomes [ (6,4) ]

Wait that can't be correct because the snake must have multiple segments.

I think perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the body list is updated. Maybe when moving, only the head changes and the rest follows behind? 

Alternatively, maybe each movement step involves the entire body shifting forward by one segment.

So after inserting new_head at front, then removing last element (if necessary) to maintain two segments—so in that case:

Each move, S becomes [new_head] followed by previous H's position. But only if not eating apple.

Wait for initial example:

Move 1: UP

H was at (6,5). new_head=(6,4)

Insert into front of body list [B1=(5,5)]: new_body = [(6,4), (6,5)]

Since not eating apple: remove last → S becomes [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Wait so now head is at (6,4); next move:

Move 2: RIGHT

new_head=(7,4)

Insert into front of current_body=[(6,5)]: new_body = [(7,4), 6,5]

Since not eating apple: remove last → S becomes [ (7,4), (6,4) ]

Now head is at (7,4); next move:

Move3: RIGHT

new_head=(8,4)

Insert into front of current_body=[(6,4)]: new_body = [(8,4), 7,4]

Remove last → S becomes [ (8,4), (7,4) ]

Head at (8,4); next move:

Move4: UP

new_head=(8,5)

Insert into front of current_body=[(7,4)]: new_body = [(8,5), 8,4]

Remove last → S becomes [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Head at (8,5); next move:

Move5: UP

new_head=(8,6)

Insert into front of current_body=[(8,4)]: new_body = [(8,6), 8,5]

Remove last → S becomes [ (8,6), (8,5) ]

Head at (8,6); next move:

Move6: UP

new_head=(8,7)

Insert into front of current_body=[(8,5)]: new_body = [(8,7), 8,6]

Remove last → S becomes [ (8,7), (8,6) ]

Head at (8,7); next move:

Move7: UP

new_head=(8,8)

Insert into front of current_body=[(8,6)]: new_body = [(8,8), 8,7]

Remove last → S becomes [ (8,8), (8,7) ]

Head at (8,8); next move:

Move8: UP

new_head=(8,9)

Insert into front of current_body=[(8,7)]: new_body = [(8,9), 8,8]

Since this is the apple's position—if it was not yet eaten, but moving there would allow us to eat it.

Now step3c says that if no collision except possibly with last element (tail). Since (8,9) is a new cell and empty, we can move there without issue. Thus:

After inserting H'=(8,9), since this was the apple's position—if not eaten before—this would be eating it.

Thus after step 3a: S becomes [ (8,9), 8,8 ]

But as per step 3b, only remove tail if not eating apple. Since we've eaten it now, so don't remove.

Hence final S is just [(8,9)], which is the head position—so success!

So total moves: 8 steps to reach (8,9).

Wait but that seems too straightforward—it took eight moves with each step moving either right or up without any issues. But in reality, this might be an unrealistic path because at each step, you have only two segments.

But according to the rules as per the problem statement:

- Each movement is allowed if new_head does not collide except possibly last element (tail).

So perhaps it's possible to reach apple with these eight moves.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting; let me recount the steps correctly.

Wait each move corresponds to moving one step. So starting from H=(6,5), B1= (5,5)

Move 1: UP → new_head=(6,4); S becomes [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

Move 2: RIGHT → (7,4); S = [(7,4), (6,4)]

Move3: RIGHT → (8,4); S=[(8,4), (7,4)]

Move4: UP→ (8,5); [ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Move5: UP → (8,6); [ (8,6), (8,5) ]

Move6: UP→ (8,7); [(8,7),(8,6)]

Move7: UP→ (8,8); [ (8,8), (8,7) ]

Move8: UP→ (8,9): since moving into apple's position and if it was empty before—so allowed. Hence S becomes [(8,9), 8,8] but as we've eaten the apple, don't remove tail.

Wait no—if after inserting H'=(8,9), body list is [ (8,9), (8,8) ] then since (8,9) was the apple's location and it wasn't occupied before, moving into it would mean the snake eats it. Therefore, S becomes [(8,9)] as we don't remove tail in this case.

So total moves: 8 steps to reach (8,9).

But wait—moving from (8,7) to (8,8) is a step where you are inserting new_head=(8,8), then body list becomes [ (8,8), (8,7) ], and since not eating apple yet, remove tail → S = [(8,8)].

Wait no—that would be after moving into (8,8). So when H was at (8,7), moved up to (8,8)—then body list becomes [ (8,8), (8,7) ]. Then since not eating apple yet, remove tail → S becomes [(8,8)].

Wait that's different—so in this scenario:

Move 1: UP; position is H=(6,4)

Move2: RIGHT; H=(7,4); S=[(7,4), (6,4)]

Move3: RIGHT; H=(8,4); S=[(8,4), (7,4)]

Move4: UP; H=(8,5); S=[(8,5), (8,4)]

Move5: UP; H=(8,6); S=[(8,6), (8,5)]

Move6: UP; H=(8,7); S=[(8,7), (8,6)]

Move7: UP; H=(8,8); S becomes [(8,8), (8,7)] → but since not eating apple yet, remove tail→ S = [ (8,8) ]

Wait—so now at Move8, H is already at (8,8). So how to reach (8,9)? We need another move.

Move 8: UP; new_head=(8,9); current_body is empty because after the previous step, S was [(8,8)]. Inserting new_head would result in [ (8,9), (8,8) ]. Since it's the apple's location and we can eat it, so final state is H at (8,9).

So total moves: 8.

Wait but if after Move7, moving to (8,8), step leads to S = [(8,8)], then for Move8:

new_head=(8,9); insert into front of empty current_body → new_body=[(8,9)]; since it's apple position and allowed, so done.

Hence 8 moves. Hmm...

But let me confirm each movement with the rules.

Move1: H from (6,5) to (6,4): 

- Insert [ (6,4), 6,5 ]

- Remove tail because not eating → S becomes [(6,4)]

Wait no—after inserting new_head=(6,4), we have body list as [ (6,4), (6,5) ]. Then since it's the first move and no apple eaten yet, remove last element→ so S = [ (6,4) ].

But that would leave S with only head. That can't be—probably my initial approach is wrong in how I'm handling the body list.

Perhaps instead of removing tail unless necessary, we should consider that each movement step shifts the body behind by one segment. So every time you move without eating apple, the snake's length remains same; but when you eat (i.e., insert new_head into position not occupied), then you can have a different outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps this is modeled such that after each move, except when moving into a cell containing food (apple in this case), we shift the body segments behind by one. So if moving to apple's location would allow us to grow—if it wasn't already part of the snake, then upon insertion, we can eat it.

But perhaps I need to model S as always being two segments—the head and previous position—since starting from H=(6,5), B1=(5,5). Each move:

Move UP: new_head= (6,4); insert → [ (6,4), 6,5 ] → since not eating apple, remove tail→ becomes [(6,4)]

Wait no—that would leave only head again.

But that can't be—how can snake exist with just one segment?

I think my initial understanding is incorrect. Perhaps the body list is always maintained as two segments: H and B1.

So in each move:

- Move to new_head

- Insert into front, so the new S = [new_head, old H]

But if you don't eat apple (i.e., new_head's cell is empty), then it's allowed; else—you can’t stay on the same position—must not collide.

Wait in that case:

Starting from (6,5) and (5,5):

Move 1: UP → new_head=(6,4); S becomes [(6,4), (6,5)]

No collision except possibly tail. Since we're moving to a new cell, it's allowed; but since not eating apple yet—step3b says if the final position is occupied by its body after step 3a, which would be [ (6,4) ] and B1= (6,5). So no collision.

Thus S becomes [(6,4), (6,5)]

Move2: RIGHT → new_head=(7,4); S = [(7,4), (6,4)]

Same process. Move3: RIGHT→(8,4); S=[(8,4),(7,4)] 

Move4: UP→(8,5); S=[(8,5), (8,4) ]

Move5: UP→(8,6); S= [(8,6), (8,5)]

Move6: UP→(8,7); S = [ (8,7), (8,6) ]

Move7: UP→(8,8); S=[ (8,8), (8,7) ]

Move8: UP→(8,9); Now when moving to (8,9):

- Insert new_head into front of body list [ (8,7) ] → becomes [(8,9), 8,7]

Since we're eating apple here—assuming that the last cell was empty. So if no collision except with tail.

But after inserting H'=(8,9); current_body is (8,7). Thus new_body = [ (8,9), (8,7) ]

Then step3b: since it's the apple position—if we move here and it's being eaten, then final S is [(8,9)]

Wait no—if you have moved into a cell that was not previously occupied by your body except for possible tail.

But in this case, after inserting H'=(8,9), current_body before step3b would be [ (8,7) ], so new_body becomes [ (8,9), (8,7) ]. Since we have moved into a cell that was not part of our body except perhaps the last one. The previous tail is at (8,7), which would now become the second segment.

But since after moving to (8,9)—which is apple's position—whether you can eat it depends on whether the new_head is in the same place as any part of your body.

Since new_head=(8,9) and current_body was [ (8,7) ], which doesn't include (8,9). Thus no collision. So step3a allows inserting; then since we're eating apple—step3c says it's allowed to not remove the tail unless it's at final position.

Thus after moving into (8,9), S becomes [(8,9)] as there’s no body left behind except itself.

Hence total moves: 8 steps. So in this case, it's possible to reach the apple with eight moves by moving right twice and then six times up without any collision.

But let me check if each of these movements is allowed according to step rules:

- Move1: UP → (6,4); no collision except after insertion; since not eating yet—allowed. S becomes [(6,4), (6,5)]

- Move2: RIGHT→(7,4); no collision with body except for tail at (6,4). Allowed.

Wait wait—if the current_body is [ (6,4) ] when moving again? I'm getting confused because each movement always adds a new_head and keeps the previous head as second segment. So perhaps S after each move is:

After Move1: [(6,4), (6,5)]

Move2: insert right→[(7,4), (6,4)]

But since we’re moving from (6,5) to (7,4)—the new_head is (7,4). Then step3a: inserting into front—[ (7,4), (6,5) ]? Wait no—I'm mixing something.

Perhaps the correct way is:

At any time, S = [current_head, previous_head]

So each move, you insert a new_head at position 0; then if not apple eaten, remove last element. Thus for the first move, starting from H=(6,5) and B1=(5,5):

Move1: UP → new_head=(6,4). Insert into front→S becomes [(6,4), (6,5)]. Since it's not eating yet—so step3b says remove last element. So S = [ (6,4) ].

But that would leave only head, which is impossible for a snake—it needs at least two segments to move? Or maybe the initial setup has the snake as H and B1; thus, moving always maintains two segments unless you eat apple?

Hmm... perhaps I need to correct my model. Let's assume S consists of [current_head, previous_head]. So starting from (6,5) and (5,5):

Move1: UP → new_head=(6,4). Insert→S=[(6,4), (6,5)].

Since not eating apple yet—step3b says to remove last element. Thus S becomes [ (6,4) ].

Wait that can't be; the snake is just a single head now—it's impossible. So perhaps I'm misapplying step 3b.

Alternatively, maybe when you move without eating, the tail remains attached. But if moving causes the new_head to collide with body except for last segment—so after inserting new_head, if there's no collision (except possibly in step where it can eat), then S would be [new_head, old_head], and since not eating yet, we do nothing else.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe another approach: think of the snake as two segments at all times—so after each move, you have H and B1; if moving to a position that's empty except for possible B1, then it’s allowed.

So starting from [(6,5), (5,5)]

Move 1: UP → new_head=(6,4). Check collision with current_body [5,5]. Since 6≠5→ allowed. S becomes [(6,4), (6,5)]

Move2: RIGHT→(7,4); check if colliding with [6,4]; no—allowed.

S=[ (7,4), (6,4) ]

Move3: RIGHT→(8,4); collide? No.

S= [(8,4),(7,4)]

Move4: UP→(8,5). Check collision; 8≠5 → allowed. S=[ (8,5), (8,4) ]

Move5: UP→(8,6); allowed since no collision except possibly last segment. S=[ (8,6), (8,5) ]

Move6: UP→(8,7); same logic.

S= [(8,7), (8,6)]

Move7: UP→(8,8). Insert new_head → [ (8,8), (8,7) ]; since not eating apple yet—allowed. S remains as is.

Wait no—it's allowed because it's a new position. So S= [(8,8), (8,7)]

Move8: UP→(8,9). Insert into front → [ (8,9), (8,8) ]

Now, since we moved to apple's location—apple is at (8,9)—so when moving here and it's not occupied by the body except for possible tail.

But current_body before insertion was [(8,7)]. So new_body after inserting would be [ (8,9), (8,7) ]. Since this includes a position that wasn't part of previous body, no collision. Then step3c: since we are eating apple here—step3 says allowed to remain without removing the tail.

Hence final S is [(8,9)]? Or does it become [ (8,9), (8,8) ]?

Wait confusion arises again on whether after moving into apple's location, do we remove the tail or not. Since step3b applies when you don't eat; but in this case, since new_head=(8,9) is being eaten as part of the process.

Thus, perhaps:

- After inserting at (8,9), check if it was occupied by any body segments except possible last one.

But after moving to (8,9):

Current_body before step3a: [ (8,7) ]

Insert new_head=(8,9); now S = [(8,9), (8,7)]

Since the apple is at (8,9)—so if we can eat it—then final S would be just [ (8,9) ].

But that seems incorrect because you still have a body following. So perhaps in this case, since we are on apple's position and it wasn't part of our previous body except for possible tail:

If new_head is at (8,9), which was empty before; then moving there would mean eating the apple, so step3c applies—no removal.

Thus final S = [ (8,9) ]

Hence we successfully reach apple in 8 moves.
</think>

The snake starts with segments at positions `(6,5)` and `(5,5)`. By making eight moves—two to the right followed by six upward movements—the snake navigates its way to the apple located at `(8,9)`.

**Answer:**

It takes \boxed{8} steps for the snake to reach the apple.
