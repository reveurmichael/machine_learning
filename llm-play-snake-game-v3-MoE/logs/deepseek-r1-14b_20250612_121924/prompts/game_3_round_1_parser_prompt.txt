BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (5,5) to the apple at (7,3). The head is currently at (5,5), and the direction is NONE. So my first move can be any direction except reversing, but since it's NONE, I think all directions are allowed.

First, let me see the movement required. The target is two units right (from 5 to 7 in x) and two units down (from 5 to 3 in y). Wait, no—since y decreases as we go down. So from y=5 to y=3 is actually moving down by 2 steps.

Wait, the coordinate system says that "UP" increases y and "DOWN" decreases it. So from (5,5) to (7,3), the head needs to move right twice and down twice. That means I need two RIGHT moves and two DOWN moves in some order.

But since the direction can't reverse immediately, but since the current direction is NONE, the first move is free. So I can choose any initial direction except NONE.

I think starting with moving right makes sense because we need to cover two units on the x-axis. Let's plan that:

1. Move RIGHT: new head at (6,5).
2. Then another RIGHT: (7,5). Now, from here, I need to move down twice.

Wait, but after moving right twice, the snake's body will have grown or moved? Wait, in the initial state, the body is empty because it's given as an empty list. So when we start, the snake has only the head, meaning length 1.

So, let me consider each step:

- Move RIGHT: new head (6,5). Since the apple isn't here yet, and there are no body segments except the old head which is now part of the body. But wait, after moving, the old head becomes the first body segment. So after the first move, the snake's body will be [(5,5)]. Then, since we didn't eat an apple (apple is at (7,3)), we remove the tail (which in this case would have been nothing because the length was 1). Wait, no: initial body is empty, so moving right makes the new head (6,5), and the old head becomes the first body segment. Since it's not an apple, we remove the last body segment—but since there are none, the body remains as [(5,5)]? Or does it get removed?

Wait, no: when you move without eating an apple, you add the new head to the front of the body list and then remove the tail. So initial state after first move:

Head is (6,5), body is empty because we added old head (5,5) but since it's a move without apple, we remove the tail—but there are no tails yet except the new body segment from the previous step.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the initial state, the snake has only the head at (5,5), and the body list is empty. So when moving right:

1. New head is (6,5).
2. Check for collision: since the body is empty except for old head which becomes a body segment. But in this case, new_head is (6,5) which doesn't collide with any body segments because the only body after adding would be [(5,5)], and new_head is (6,5), so no collision.
3. Then, since apple isn't at (6,5), we proceed to update the body: insert old head (5,5) into the front of body list, which was empty. So now body becomes [ (5,5) ].
4. Since it's not an apple move, remove the tail—but the tail is now the last element, which is (5,5). But wait, we just added that; so after adding, the body is [(5,5)], and since we're not eating, we need to pop the tail. So body becomes empty again.

Wait, no: according to movement update rule 3c, if not growing, remove the last element of the BODY list. But in this case, the body was empty before inserting old head, so after insertion, it's [ (5,5) ]. Then, since we're not eating an apple, we remove the last element, which is (5,5), leaving body as empty again.

So after first move, the snake's position is head at (6,5), and body list is empty. So effectively, it's just moving right without any body segments except for the previous step.

Wait, that can't be right because each movement adds the old head to the front of the body. But if we're not growing, the body would only have the last inserted head.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the update rules. Let me re-read:

3a: Insert old head at front of BODY list (becomes BODY1).

3b: If new_head is apple, grow by not removing tail.

3c: Else, remove last element.

So in the first move:

- After moving right, body becomes [old_head] = [(5,5)].

- Since we didn't eat an apple, we proceed to 3c: remove last element. So body is now empty again.

Wait, that would mean that after each move (except when growing), the body list remains empty? That can't be right because then the snake's length doesn't change, which contradicts the example given in movement rules.

In the example where the snake is [HEAD (4,4), BODY1 (4,3)], and direction is LEFT:

- New head (3,4).

- No collision.

- Insert old_head into front of body list: [(4,4), (4,3)].

- Since not eating apple, remove last element: so body becomes [(4,4)]. So the snake's new state is [ (3,4) as head, (4,4) as body1 ].

So in that case, after a normal move, the body list loses one segment. So when initial length was 2, it remains at 2 because one is added and then removed.

Wait, no: initial length was 2 (head + one body). After moving left:

- new_head is (3,4).

- Insert old head into front of body list, which was [ (4,3) ] → becomes [ (4,4), (4,3) ].

- Then remove last element (since not apple), so body becomes [ (4,4) ].

Thus, the snake's length remains at 2: head is new position, and one body segment follows.

Wait, but in that example, the initial body was from HEAD to BODY1. So after moving left, the body grows by adding old_head, then removes tail only if not eating apple.

So for our problem:

- Initial state: head (5,5), body is empty (so length 1).

Move right:

- new_head (6,5).

- Check collision: no issues.

- Insert old head into front of body → body becomes [ (5,5) ].

- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes empty again.

So after the first move, the snake is at (6,5), with an empty body. So effectively, it's moving as if it's length 1 again.

Wait, that seems odd because in reality, when you move a snake of length 1, the body would just follow, but since we're not adding any segments, perhaps the initial moves are treated differently.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the update rules. Let me think again.

Another example from movement:

If S = [HEAD (5,5), BODY1 (5,4), BODY2 (5,3)] and apple is at (6,5). Choose RIGHT → new head (6,5).

- Insert old head into front of body: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ].

- Since new_head is apple, grow by not removing tail. So body becomes [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ], and the new S includes all these plus the new head?

Wait, no: in movement example for eating apple:

After moving to apple position, insert old head into front of body, making it [old_head, ...], then since we ate apple, don't remove tail. So the body becomes longer by one.

But in our case, when moving right from (5,5) with empty body, inserting old head gives [ (5,5) ], and since not eating, remove last element → body is empty again.

So each normal move doesn't change the length; only when eating apple does it grow.

Therefore, for our problem:

- Initial state: head at (5,5), body empty. Length 1.

- Move right: new_head (6,5). Body becomes [ (5,5) ], then remove tail → body is empty again. So after move 1, snake is at (6,5), length still 1.

Then move right again to (7,5). Again, same process: body becomes [ (6,5) ] and then removed, so body remains empty. Now head is at (7,5).

From here, we need to get down two steps to y=3.

But the apple is at (7,3), which is directly below. So we can try moving DOWN twice.

Wait, but after moving down once from (7,5) → (7,4). Then another move down to (7,3).

But let's check for collisions:

After moving right twice to reach (7,5):

- Each move was safe because the body remained empty except during the transition.

Now, when at (7,5), we need to move down.

Move 1: DOWN → (7,4). Check collision: no body segments because after each normal move, body is emptied. So this is safe.

Then, another move down to (7,3) where apple is located.

But wait, the apple is at (7,3), so when we reach there, we have eaten it. Thus, in that case, the body won't be popped.

Let me plan each step:

1. Move RIGHT: head (6,5). Body becomes [ (5,5) ], then removed → body empty.
2. Move RIGHT again: head (7,5). Body becomes [ (6,5) ], then removed → body empty.
3. Now, move DOWN: new head (7,4). Since we're not at apple yet, check collision: body is empty after adding old head (7,5), but when moving down, the body list after insertion would be [ (7,5) ] and then since it's a normal move, remove last → body remains empty. So safe.
4. Move DOWN again to (7,3). Now, new_head is at apple.

When we reach (7,3):

- Insert old head (7,4) into front of body list, which was empty → body becomes [ (7,4) ].
- Since new_head is apple, don't remove tail. So body remains [ (7,4) ].
- Thus, the snake's length increases by one.

But wait, initial length after each move:

After step 1: head at (6,5), body empty → length 1.

Step 2: head at (7,5), body empty → length 1.

Step 3: head at (7,4), body becomes [ (7,5) ] then removed → length 1.

Wait no: after moving down to (7,4):

- Insert old head into front of body list: body is [ (7,5) ].
- Since we're not at apple yet, remove last element → body becomes empty again. So after this move, head is at (7,4), body empty.

Then, step 4: moving down to (7,3):

- Insert old head (7,4) into front of body list → [ (7,4) ].
- Since new_head is apple, don't remove tail. So body remains [ (7,4) ].
- Thus, after this move, the snake has head at (7,3), body at (7,4). Now, length is 2.

So, in total, the moves are:

1. RIGHT → (6,5)
2. RIGHT → (7,5)
3. DOWN → (7,4)
4. DOWN → (7,3)

But I need to make sure that none of these steps cause collision with body segments except when necessary.

Wait, in step 3: moving down from (7,5) to (7,4). When we do this:

- After inserting old head into front of body list, it's [ (7,5) ].
- Then since new_head is not apple yet, remove last element → body empty again.

So no collision because during the movement, the only body segment is (7,5), which is being added and then removed. The new_head (7,4) doesn't collide with any existing body segments except for possibly the old head.

Wait, but in step 3, when moving down from (7,5):

- Old head is (7,5). So after inserting into body list, we have [ (7,5) ].
- Then we check collision: new_head is (7,4), which doesn't collide with any existing body segments except if the old head was in a position that would cause collision.

Wait, but at this point, the body is being updated. So during step 3:

Before moving, the snake's state is head at (7,5), body empty.

Move down to (7,4):

- Check for collision: new_head (7,4) needs to not be in any position of the current body segments before adding old head.

But in this case, the current body is empty, so no collision.

After moving:

- Insert old head (7,5) into front → body becomes [ (7,5) ].
- Since not apple, remove last element → body remains empty.

So no collision.

Similarly, step 4: moving down to (7,3):

- Current state is head at (7,4), body empty.
- Move down: new_head (7,3).
- Insert old head into front of body list → [ (7,4) ].
- Since new_head is apple, don't remove tail. So body becomes [ (7,4) ].

Thus, the snake's path is clear except for when it eats the apple.

So overall, this sequence should work:

1. RIGHT
2. RIGHT
3. DOWN
4. DOWN

This would get us from (5,5) → (6,5) → (7,5) → (7,4) → (7,3), eating the apple at the end.

But wait, I'm assuming that in each step, there's no collision except for when it's necessary. But let me make sure:

After moving right twice, we're at (7,5). Then down twice to (7,3).

Is there any chance that during these moves, the new head would collide with the body?

In step 1: move right from (5,5) → (6,5): no collision.

Step 2: move right again to (7,5): no collision.

Then, moving down:

From (7,5):

- Move down to (7,4). Since during this move, the only body segment is being added and then removed, so no existing segments. So safe.

Move down again to (7,3): same logic; new_head is at apple, but previous body segments are [ (7,4) ] after insertion.

But in that case, when moving from (7,4) to (7,3), the new_head is (7,3). The body after insertion would be [ (7,4) ], and since it's an apple move, we don't remove anything. So (7,3) doesn't collide with any body segments because the only segment is at (7,4).

So overall, this sequence should work.

Alternatively, could I mix RIGHT and DOWN moves?

Like right, down, right, down? Let me see:

1. RIGHT → (6,5)
2. DOWN → (6,4). Check for collision: body becomes [ (6,5) ], then removed → body empty.
3. RIGHT → (7,4)
4. DOWN → (7,3)

In this case, during step 4, moving down from (7,4) to (7,3):

- Insert old head into front of body list: body becomes [ (7,4) ].
- Since it's an apple, don't remove tail.

But in this path:

After step 1: (6,5), body empty.

Step 2: down to (6,4). Body after insertion is [ (6,5) ], then removed → body remains empty. Safe.

Step 3: right to (7,4). Insert old head (6,4) into front of body list → body becomes [ (6,4) ]. Then since not apple, remove last element → body empty again.

Wait, no: when moving from (6,5) down to (6,4), then step 3 is moving right from (6,4) to (7,4):

- Insert old head into front of body list, which was empty after the previous move. So body becomes [ (6,4) ].

- Since new_head is not apple yet, remove last element → body remains empty.

Wait no: inserting the old head into front of body list before removing:

After step 2: moving down to (6,4):

- Insert old head (6,5) into front → body becomes [ (6,5) ].
- Since new_head is (6,4), and not apple, remove last element → body remains empty.

Then step 3: move right from (6,4) to (7,4):

- Insert old head (6,4) into front → body becomes [ (6,4) ].
- Since not apple, remove last → body is empty again.

So after step 3, the snake is at (7,4), body empty.

Then step 4: move down to (7,3):

- Insert old head (7,4) into front of body list → [ (7,4) ].
- Since new_head is apple, don't remove tail. So body remains [ (7,4) ].

Thus, this path also works, and the head reaches the apple without collision.

So both sequences are possible: R, R, D, D or R, D, R, D.

But since in our initial plan we need two rights followed by two downs, or interleaved.

But to make sure that there's no collision during any steps, perhaps the first approach is safer because it keeps the movement along the same x-axis before moving down, which may minimize potential collisions (although in this case, none occur).

Alternatively, I can try another approach: down first, then right. Let me see:

1. DOWN → (5,4). But since initial direction is NONE, this is allowed.

- Insert old head into front of body list → [ (5,5) ].
- Since new_head is not apple, remove last → body remains empty.

2. RIGHT → (6,4).

3. DOWN → (6,3).

4. RIGHT → (7,3). Now, this is the apple.

But in step 4: moving from (6,3) to (7,3):

- Insert old head into front of body list: after step 3:

At step 3: move down from (6,4) to (6,3).

- Insert old head (6,4) → body becomes [ (6,4) ].
- Since new_head is (6,3), not apple, remove last → body remains empty.

Then step 4: move right from (6,3) to (7,3):

- Insert old head into front of body list → [ (6,3) ].
- Since it's the apple, don't remove. So body becomes [ (6,3) ].

Thus, this path also works:

D, R, D, R.

But in all cases, we need four moves: two rights and two downs, arranged in any order that allows us to reach the apple without colliding.

Therefore, a possible sequence is RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN.
</think>

The snake needs to move from (5,5) to the apple at (7,3). To achieve this without colliding with its body, it can make four moves: two rights and two downs in any order that avoids self-collision. A safe sequence is moving right twice followed by down twice.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Move RIGHT**: The snake's head moves from (5,5) to (6,5). No collision occurs as the body remains empty.
2. **Move RIGHT again**: Head moves from (6,5) to (7,5). Body is still empty after each move.
3. **Move DOWN**: From (7,5), the head moves down to (7,4). Insert old head into body; since not apple, remove it, so no collision.
4. **Move DOWN again**: From (7,4), the head moves down to (7,3) where the apple is located. The body now includes (7,4), and since it's an apple, it doesn't get removed.

Final answer: \boxed{\text{RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN}}

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (5, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (7, 3). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". Note that directions are uppercase. You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for representing moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
