========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to get the snake from (9,3) to eat the apple at (7,7). 

First, I'll look at the current state. The head is at (9,3), and it's moving DOWN. The body is at [(9,4)], so that means the tail is right below the head because the body list starts with the segment immediately behind the head.

The apple is at (7,7). So from the head's position, I need to move left two times and up four times. But since each move can only be in one direction per step, I have to plan a path that gets me there without colliding with the body or going out of bounds.

Right now, the snake is facing DOWN. The next move can't reverse, so I can't go UP immediately. So possible initial moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.

But wait, looking at the grid, from (9,3), moving DOWN would take me to (9,2). Is that allowed? Let's check for collisions. If I move DOWN, the new head would be (9,2). The body is at (9,4), which is behind me. Wait, no—after moving, the body will shift. Hmm.

Wait, actually, when moving, after checking collision, if it's safe, we update the body. So moving to (9,2) as new head, then adding (9,3) to the front of the body. The body was [(9,4)], so inserting head would make it [(9,3), (9,4)]. Then, since I didn't eat an apple (apple is at 7,7), we remove the tail, which is (9,4). So after moving DOWN, the new body is just [(9,3)].

So the snake length remains 2? Wait no—the initial state: head is at (9,3), body is [(9,4)], so total length is 2. If I move down to (9,2) without eating an apple, the body becomes [(9,3), (9,4)] after insertion, then we remove tail, which is (9,4). So body remains [(9,3)]. Wait that can't be right—because inserting head makes it [head old, body...], but if I don't eat, I remove the last element. Hmm.

Wait, let's clarify:

After moving to new_head, insert the old head into the body list at the front. Then, if not eating apple, remove the last element (the tail). So for the initial move DOWN from (9,3):

- New head: (9,2)
- Insert (9,3) at front of body: [(9,3), (9,4)]
- Remove last element because not eating apple: so new body is [(9,3)].

So now, the snake's segments are (9,2) as head and (9,3) as body. That makes sense.

But moving down from (9,3) to (9,2)—I need to check if (9,2) is within bounds and not colliding with any other body except possibly the tail when it moves.

Wait, after inserting, the body becomes [(9,3), (9,4)]. But before the move, I have to check collision. The new head is (9,2). Are there any body cells except the tail's current cell that would collide? The tail is at (9,4) before moving, but when checking for collision, only the non-tail body parts are checked against the new head.

So in this case, after inserting, the body becomes [old head (9,3), then old body (9,4)]. But during collision check, we're looking if new_head is in any of the existing body except possibly the tail's position before movement. Wait, no—the problem says:

"If new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn."

So, the body cells given are [(9,4)]—so in the initial state, after moving down, the body is [ (9,3), (9,4) ].

Wait, no—the body list is provided as [(9,4)], which are the body segments behind the head. So when checking collision for new_head (9,2):

- The body cells to check are from the original state: [(9,4)].
- So (9,2) is not in that list except if it's the tail's current cell.

Wait, no—the tail's current cell is part of the body list. Because in the initial state, after inserting, the tail becomes (9,3), which was previously the head.

Wait this is getting confusing. Let me refer back to the movement rules.

The collision check uses the state before body shifts. So when moving to new_head:

- The current body is [(9,4)].
- The new_head is (9,2).
- Check if new_head is in any of the body cells except the tail's position when it will move this turn.

Wait, what's the tail's position? In the original state, the snake's body is [BODY1: (9,4)], so the tail is at (9,4). But when moving down to (9,2), the new head is (9,2), and the collision check is against the current body cells [(9,4)]. So (9,2) isn't in that list, so it's safe.

Wait no—the collision check uses the state before the body shifts. So after the move, the body will be [old_head, ...], but during collision checking, only the original body is considered except for the tail.

Wait I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline:

1. Current head: (9,3)
2. Current direction: DOWN
3. Body cells: [(9,4)] → so snake is [head (9,3), body (9,4)]

If I move DOWN:
- new_head = (9,3) + DOWN's delta → y decreases by 1 → (9,2)
- Check collision: is new_head in any body cell except the tail's current cell when it moves?
Wait, no—the collision check is based on the state before the body shifts. So the body is still [(9,4)] during this check.

So new_head is (9,2). Does (9,2) equal any of the body cells? The body cells are [(9,4)], so no. Therefore, moving down is safe.

After that, in the update step:
- Insert old head (9,3) into the front of the body → new body becomes [ (9,3), (9,4) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove the last element → body becomes [ (9,3) ]

So after moving down, the snake is at (9,2) as head and (9,3) as body. That seems okay.

But I need to reach (7,7). So from (9,3), perhaps it's better to move LEFT first because we're two columns away in x-coordinate (from 9 to 7).

Wait, but moving left from (9,3) would take me to (8,3). Let me see if that's safe.

Current direction is DOWN. I can't reverse, so next move can't be UP. So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

If I choose LEFT first:

- new_head = (8,3)
- Check collision: body cells before movement are [(9,4)]. So (8,3) isn't in that list → safe.
- Insert old head (9,3) into the front of the body → [ (9,3), (9,4) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → new body is [ (9,3) ]

So snake becomes [ (8,3), (9,3) ]

Then, I can continue moving LEFT again to (7,3). Let's see:

Next move: LEFT from (8,3):

- new_head = (7,3)
- Check collision with body [(9,3)] → no collision.
- Insert (8,3) into front of body → [ (8,3), (9,3) ]
- Remove last element → body becomes [ (8,3) ]

Now at (7,3). From here, I need to move up 4 times to reach y=7. Let's plan that.

But wait, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move next turn. So when approaching the apple, I have to make sure that after moving into it, my tail isn't blocking me and that I can still move further.

Wait, but let's first get closer.

Alternatively, perhaps a better path is to move up towards (9,7), but wait, the head is at (9,3) which is on the top row. Wait no, the grid goes from y=0 (bottom) to y=9 (top). So moving UP from (9,3) would take it to (9,4), which is directly above.

Wait, maybe a better strategy is to move in a way that allows me to get to (7,7) without getting stuck by the body.

Another approach: Since I'm at (9,3), and the apple is at (7,7). The Manhattan distance is 2 left and 4 up. So I need to make two LEFT moves and four UP moves.

But initial direction is DOWN. So first move can't be UP, but perhaps moving LEFT twice to get closer in x-coordinate and then moving UP as needed.

Let me try:

1. Move LEFT → (8,3)
   - Safe? Yes.
2. Move LEFT again → (7,3)
   - Safe? Yes.
3. Now, I need to move up 4 times.

But my current direction is still DOWN unless I change it. So after moving left twice, I can then start moving UP.

Wait, but each time I make a move, the direction changes, right? Or does the direction stay until I change it?

No—the direction persists unless changed by another direction command. Wait, no, the problem says you are to provide a series of moves—each step is a direction.

So in this scenario, I can plan a path that first goes left twice and then up four times.

But wait, let me check if moving up from (7,3) is possible without collision.

After getting to (7,3), the body would be... Let's see:

Starting at (9,3). First move LEFT: (8,3), body becomes [ (9,3) ]

Second move LEFT: (7,3), body becomes [ (8,3) ]

So now, from (7,3):

- Body is [(8,3)]
- Move UP → new_head = (7,4)
  - Check collision with current body [(8,3)]? No.
  - Insert old head (7,3) into front of body → [ (7,3), (8,3) ]
  - Since not eating apple, remove last element → body is [ (7,3) ]

And so on.

So after four UP moves, I'd reach (7,7). Let's check:

From (7,3):

1. Move UP → (7,4)
2. Move UP → (7,5)
3. Move UP → (7,6)
4. Move UP → (7,7)

Each time, the body will be updated as I move up.

But when I'm at (7,7), I need to make sure that after moving into it, my next move can still go somewhere. Because once I eat the apple, I don't remove the tail, so the snake gets longer by one segment.

Wait no—if you eat an apple, you don't remove the tail; otherwise, you do. But in this problem, there's only one apple at (7,7). So when moving into (7,7), since that's where the apple is, I'll have to handle it as such.

So after moving into (7,7):

- Insert old head (7,6) into front of body.
- Since we ate the apple, don't remove tail → body becomes [ (7,6), ... ] but wait, no—the initial state before eating is just the current segments.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline all steps:

1. Start at (9,3) facing DOWN.
2. Move LEFT to (8,3). Body: [(9,3)] → after inserting old head and not removing tail, body becomes [ (8,3), (9,3) ] but wait no—when moving to new_head, insert the old head into the front of the current body.

Wait, I think this is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to find a path that doesn't involve any collision and ensures I can reach the apple.

Alternatively, perhaps moving DOWN first would extend the snake downward but might not be optimal.

Another idea: After moving down once to (9,2), then start moving LEFT towards (7,2) and then up 4 steps.

But let's see:

1. Move DOWN from (9,3) → (9,2). Body becomes [ (9,3) ]
2. Move LEFT to (8,2)
   - Check collision: body is [ (9,3) ] → safe.
   - Insert old head (9,2), body becomes [ (9,2), (9,3) ], then remove last element → body is [ (9,2) ]
3. Move LEFT to (7,2)
   - Body after inserting old head (8,2): [ (8,2), (9,2) ] → remove last element, body is [ (8,2) ]
4. Now move UP four times.

Wait, but from (7,2):

1. Move UP to (7,3)
   - Body after inserting old head (7,2): [ (7,2), (8,2) ] → remove last element, body is [ (7,2) ]
2. Move UP to (7,4)
3. Move UP to (7,5)
4. Move UP to (7,6)

Wait, but that only gets me up to y=6. I need y=7.

Hmm, so perhaps this path isn't sufficient. Maybe better to move more towards the right before moving up?

Alternatively, maybe after two LEFT moves and four UP moves as I initially thought.

But in any case, it's clear that moving left twice and then up four times is a possible way, provided I don't collide with my body.

So let me outline:

1. Move LEFT from (9,3) to (8,3)
2. Move LEFT again to (7,3)
3. Move UP to (7,4)
4. Move UP to (7,5)
5. Move UP to (7,6)
6. Move UP to (7,7)

Each time, after moving, the body is updated without collision.

But wait, when I move to (7,3), my body will be [ (8,3) ] from previous moves.

Then moving up to (7,4):

- Insert old head (7,3) into front → body becomes [ (7,3), (8,3) ]
- Remove last element → body is [ (7,3) ]

Similarly, each subsequent move up adds the new head and removes the tail, so I don't collide.

Therefore, the path would be:

Left, Left, Up, Up, Up, Up

Which totals six moves: two LEFTs and four UPs.

So in terms of directions:

LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP, UP, UP.

But wait, after moving down initially, perhaps that's not necessary. Since initial direction is DOWN, but first move can be LEFT, which changes the direction to LEFT.

Wait no—the series of moves are a sequence of direction commands; each step you choose the direction regardless of previous direction. So starting at (9,3), facing DOWN, but I can change direction as needed.

Therefore, it's possible to make the first two moves as LEFT, then four UPs.

So the moves would be:

1. LEFT → (8,3)
2. LEFT → (7,3)
3. UP → (7,4)
4. UP → (7,5)
5. UP → (7,6)
6. UP → (7,7)

I think this should work.

Let me verify each step:

1. Move LEFT from (9,3) to (8,3):
   - Collision check: body is [(9,4)] before movement.
   - new_head = (8,3) not in [ (9,4) ] → safe.
   - Insert old head (9,3) into body front → [ (9,3), (9,4) ]
   - Remove last element → body becomes [ (9,3) ]

2. Move LEFT from (8,3) to (7,3):
   - Collision check: body is [ (9,3) ] before movement.
   - new_head = (7,3) not in [ (9,3) ] → safe.
   - Insert old head (8,3) into body front → [ (8,3), (9,3) ]
   - Remove last element → body becomes [ (8,3) ]

Wait no—after the first move, the body was [ (9,3) ]. Then moving left again:

- new_head is (7,3)
- Insert old head (8,3) into front of current body: [ (8,3), (9,3) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove last element → body becomes [ (8,3) ]

Wait that seems conflicting. Let me retrace:

After first move LEFT to (8,3):

- Insert old head (9,3) into front of original body [(9,4)] → new body is [ (9,3), (9,4) ]
- Remove last element because not eating apple → new body is [ (9,3) ]

Then second move LEFT from (8,3) to (7,3):

- Insert old head (8,3) into front of current body [ (9,3) ] → new body becomes [ (8,3), (9,3) ]
- Remove last element because not eating apple → new body is [ (8,3) ]

Wait that seems incorrect because the direction changes each time. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the body updates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a series of steps:

Each move step:

1. From current head position and body list, compute next position based on direction.
2. Check if new_head is within bounds and not colliding with any body cells except possibly the tail when it moves.
3. Update body by inserting new_head at front and removing last cell unless an apple is eaten.

But in our case, we don't eat any apples except the final one, but wait—the problem statement doesn't mention multiple apples; only that you have to reach (7,7). So I assume that when moving into (7,7), it's considered as eating the apple, so body won't remove the tail.

But since in our case, we aren't considering any other apples, perhaps all moves are just normal movements without eating, except the last one which may or may not be considered as eating. Hmm, but I'm supposed to eat that apple to complete the task.

This complicates things because if I don't eat the apple at (7,7), then my path would require careful planning to not collide with the body after each move. If I do eat it, the snake grows, so the body doesn't reduce in length.

But perhaps for simplicity, I'll assume that moving into (7,7) is considered as eating the apple, and thus, the body doesn't remove the tail. Therefore, the path would be feasible with six moves: two LEFTs and four UPs.

So the final answer should be a sequence of directions: LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP, UP, UP.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the starting position (9, 3) to the target position (7, 7) on a grid. The movement is restricted to the four cardinal directions: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. The goal is to determine a valid sequence of moves that will take us from the starting point to the target without colliding with our own body, which grows as we move.

### Approach
1. **Initial Position**: Start at position (9, 3) facing DOWN.
2. **Move LEFT**: Change direction to LEFT and move towards (8, 3).
3. **Move LEFT Again**: Continue moving LEFT to reach (7, 3).
4. **Change Direction to UP**: From (7, 3), start moving UP in the subsequent steps.
5. **Move Up Four Times**: Move from (7, 3) to (7, 4), then to (7, 5), followed by (7, 6), and finally to (7, 7).

Each move is validated to ensure that we do not collide with our own body, which updates as we move. The sequence of moves ensures that we reach the target without any collisions.

### Solution Code
```python
# This code outlines the steps taken to solve the problem.
# Each comment represents a move in the specified direction.

# Starting position: (9, 3)
# Move LEFT to (8, 3)
# Move LEFT again to (7, 3)
# Then, move UP four times to reach (7, 7)

moves = ["LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"]
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Position**: We start at (9, 3). 
2. **First Move LEFT**: This changes our position to (8, 3).
3. **Second Move LEFT**: This changes our position to (7, 3).
4. **Subsequent Moves UP**: Each move UP updates our y-coordinate until we reach (7, 7).

This approach ensures that we systematically navigate from the starting point to the target without any collisions by carefully choosing each direction step-by-step. The sequence of moves is straightforward and avoids complex pathfinding algorithms, focusing instead on a direct route.
