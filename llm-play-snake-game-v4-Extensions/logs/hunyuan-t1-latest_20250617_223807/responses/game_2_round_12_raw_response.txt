========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move left 5 times to reach the apple at (0,4) from (5,4). Each left move is safe as the new head positions (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4) do not collide with the snake's body (checked before each move). After the fifth move, the snake eats the apple, grows, and has legal moves (e.g., UP, DOWN) remaining."
