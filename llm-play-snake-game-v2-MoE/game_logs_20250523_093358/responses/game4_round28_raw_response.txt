========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

To solve this problem, I'll need to plan a path for the snake from its current position (8, 8) to the apple at (8, 4), following all game rules. Let's analyze the situation:

1. The head is currently at (8, 8).
2. The apple is located at (8, 4).
3. Current direction is UP.
4. Body positions: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7)].

Since the snake's head is at (8, 8) and needs to reach (8, 4), we need to move directly downwards. However, we have to consider the snake's body positions.

The body segments that are in the way or close to the path include:
- (8, 7)
- (7, 7)

The most straightforward approach would be moving DOWN until reaching y=4 without colliding with any part of its own body. Here’s how we can plan this:

1. Move DOWN from (8, 8) to (8, 7).
2. Continue moving DOWN from (8, 7) to (8, 6).
3. Move DOWN from (8, 6) to (8, 5).
4. Finally, move DOWN from (8, 5) to (8, 4).

This path avoids colliding with the snake’s body and stays within grid bounds.

Here's the JSON object representing this plan:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move directly DOWN until reaching the apple at (8,4)."
}
```

Let's validate that:
1. Starting position: (8, 8)
2. Apple position: (8, 4)

The difference in y-coordinates is 4 units downward.

Moves needed:
- From (8, 8) to (8, 7): DOWN
- From (8, 7) to (8, 6): DOWN
- From (8, 6) to (8, 5): DOWN
- From (8, 5) to (8, 4): DOWN

Total moves = 4 DOWNs.

So the final output is:

```json
{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "Move directly DOWN until reaching the apple at (8,4)."
}
```
