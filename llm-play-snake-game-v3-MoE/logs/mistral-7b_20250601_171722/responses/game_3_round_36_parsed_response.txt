{
  "moves": ["DOWN", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "To avoid immediate self-collision, we start moving down from the current position (1,9). Then we move 4 times to the right to reach the apple at (5,4). This path respects the rules of movement and ensures a safe distance from the tail since it will not be moving after eating the apple."
