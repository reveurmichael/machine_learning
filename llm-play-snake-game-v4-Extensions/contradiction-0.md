Now, among all those guideline files, in their statements within those md files, in ./docs/extensions-guildeline (ignore empty md files), what are obviously wrong or not good or not coherent? what's the solution to adopt to make things good? write that into : ROOT/contradiction-2.md



make all md files coherent. starting for final-decison-10.md make its ideas propagande to other md files and then it will be consistent and coherent. do it step by step. and go back and forth. and step by step again.
