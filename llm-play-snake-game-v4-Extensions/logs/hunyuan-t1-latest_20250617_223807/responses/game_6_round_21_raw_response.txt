========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "UP", "UP"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 2 right and 2 up to reach the apple at (5,4). Starting with RIGHT avoids collision with the body (current BODY1 is (3,3), so moving UP to (3,3) is invalid). Moving RIGHT twice gets to (5,2), then UP twice reaches (5,4) (apple). Each step checks for collisions with body cells (none in path) and stays within grid. After eating, there are safe moves (e.g., UP, LEFT, RIGHT) avoiding self-collision."
