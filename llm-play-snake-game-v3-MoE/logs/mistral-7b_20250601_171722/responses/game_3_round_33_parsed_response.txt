```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Start by moving LEFT to avoid moving into a BODY cell (which is at (2,2) and our head is initially at (2,3)). Then move UP twice to reach the apple at (1,7), using the shortest path while maintaining continuity. This also ensures that we won't be hugging walls unnecessarily near the apple or getting trapped."
