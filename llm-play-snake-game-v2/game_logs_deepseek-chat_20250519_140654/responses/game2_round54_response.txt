Alright, let's tackle this Snake game problem step by step. I'm going to plan a sequence of moves that will safely guide the snake's head from its current position at (4, 1) to the apple at (0, 9), avoiding collisions with its own body and the walls.

### Understanding the Current State

1. **Head Position**: (4, 1)
2. **Current Direction**: DOWN
3. **Body Cells**: [(2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2)]
4. **Apple Position**: (0, 9)

### Movement Rules Recap

- **Valid Moves**: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
- **Opposite Moves**: Cannot move in the exact opposite of the current direction. Since current direction is DOWN, we cannot move UP next.
- **Collisions**: 
  - Cannot move into any body cell.
  - Cannot move outside the grid (0 ≤ x < 10, 0 ≤ y < 10).
- **Apple Eating**: Eating the apple increases the body length by 1.

### Goal

Plan a sequence of moves (5-30) that takes the head to (0, 9), ensuring:
- Number of LEFT moves - RIGHT moves = 4 (since x_head - x_apple = 4 - 0 = 4)
- Number of UP moves - DOWN moves = 8 (since y_apple - y_head = 9 - 1 = 8)

### Initial Observations

- The apple is to the left (x=0 vs x=4) and up (y=9 vs y=1) from the head.
- Current direction is DOWN, so next move cannot be UP.
- Body is mostly to the right and above the head, forming a sort of barrier.

### Planning the Path

Given the body's position, moving directly left might be tricky because the body is at (4,2) above the head (4,1). Moving left would take us to (3,1), which seems safe as (3,1) is not in the body list.

But let's think step by step:

1. **First Move Options**:
   - Cannot go UP (opposite of DOWN).
   - DOWN: (4, 0) - within bounds, not in body.
   - LEFT: (3, 1) - within bounds, not in body.
   - RIGHT: (5, 1) - within bounds, but (5,1) is not in body, but moving right seems counterintuitive since apple is left.

   Best first move seems LEFT to (3,1).

2. **After LEFT to (3,1)**:
   - Current direction is now LEFT.
   - Next cannot go RIGHT (opposite).
   - Apple is at (0,9), so need to go UP and LEFT more.
   - Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.
   - UP: (3,2) - check body: (4,2) is in body, but (3,2) is not. Safe.
   - DOWN: (3,0) - safe.
   - LEFT: (2,1) - safe.

   To get closer to apple, UP is better to increase y.

3. **Move UP to (3,2)**:
   - Current direction is UP.
   - Next cannot go DOWN.
   - Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.
   - UP: (3,3) - safe.
   - LEFT: (2,2) - safe.
   - RIGHT: (4,2) - in body. Avoid.

   Let's go UP to (3,3).

4. **Move UP to (3,3)**:
   - Current direction is UP.
   - Next cannot go DOWN.
   - Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.
   - UP: (3,4) - safe.
   - LEFT: (2,3) - safe.
   - RIGHT: (4,3) - safe.

   Continue UP to (3,4).

5. **Move UP to (3,4)**:
   - Current direction is UP.
   - Next cannot go DOWN.
   - Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.
   - UP: (3,5) - in body (3,5). Avoid.
   - LEFT: (2,4) - safe.
   - RIGHT: (4,4) - safe.

   Need to go left towards apple. LEFT to (2,4).

6. **Move LEFT to (2,4)**:
   - Current direction is LEFT.
   - Next cannot go RIGHT.
   - Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.
   - UP: (2,5) - in body (2,5). Avoid.
   - DOWN: (2,3) - safe.
   - LEFT: (1,4) - safe.

   Go LEFT to (1,4).

7. **Move LEFT to (1,4)**:
   - Current direction is LEFT.
   - Next cannot go RIGHT.
   - Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.
   - UP: (1,5) - safe.
   - DOWN: (1,3) - safe.
   - LEFT: (0,4) - safe.

   Go LEFT to (0,4) to reach x=0.

8. **Move LEFT to (0,4)**:
   - Now at x=0, need to go up to y=9.
   - Current direction is LEFT.
   - Next cannot go RIGHT.
   - Possible moves: UP, DOWN.
   - DOWN: (0,3) - away from apple.
   - UP: (0,5) - safe.

   Go UP to (0,5).

9. **Move UP to (0,5)**:
   - Current direction is UP.
   - Next cannot go DOWN.
   - Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.
   - LEFT: (-1,5) - out of bounds.
   - RIGHT: (1,5) - safe.
   - UP: (0,6) - safe.

   Go UP to (0,6).

10. **Move UP to (0,6)**:
    - Current direction is UP.
    - Next cannot go DOWN.
    - Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.
    - LEFT: invalid.
    - RIGHT: (1,6) - safe.
    - UP: (0,7) - safe.

    Go UP to (0,7).

11. **Move UP to (0,7)**:
    - Current direction is UP.
    - Next cannot go DOWN.
    - Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.
    - LEFT: invalid.
    - RIGHT: (1,7) - safe.
    - UP: (0,8) - safe.

    Go UP to (0,8).

12. **Move UP to (0,8)**:
    - Current direction is UP.
    - Next cannot go DOWN.
    - Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.
    - LEFT: invalid.
    - RIGHT: (1,8) - safe.
    - UP: (0,9) - apple!

    Go UP to (0,9) to eat the apple.

### Verifying the Moves

Let's list the moves and check the counts:

1. LEFT: (4,1) → (3,1)
2. UP: (3,1) → (3,2)
3. UP: (3,2) → (3,3)
4. UP: (3,3) → (3,4)
5. LEFT: (3,4) → (2,4)
6. LEFT: (2,4) → (1,4)
7. LEFT: (1,4) → (0,4)
8. UP: (0,4) → (0,5)
9. UP: (0,5) → (0,6)
10. UP: (0,6) → (0,7)
11. UP: (0,7) → (0,8)
12. UP: (0,8) → (0,9)

Counts:
- LEFT: 4 (moves 1,5,6,7)
- RIGHT: 0
- UP: 8 (moves 2,3,4,8,9,10,11,12)
- DOWN: 0

Check:
- LEFT - RIGHT = 4 - 0 = 4 (matches x_head - x_apple = 4)
- UP - DOWN = 8 - 0 = 8 (matches y_apple - y_head = 8)

### Checking for Collisions

At each step, the new head position is not in the body list, and within bounds.

### Final Move Sequence

The sequence is: LEFT, UP, UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP, UP, UP, UP

This is 12 moves, which is within the 5-30 range.

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "moves": ["LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "Move left to align x with apple, then ascend vertically to reach the apple at (0,9), avoiding body collisions."
}
