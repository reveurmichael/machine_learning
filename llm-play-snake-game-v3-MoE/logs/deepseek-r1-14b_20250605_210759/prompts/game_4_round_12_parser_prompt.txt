BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out how to move the snake from (8,5) to eat the apple at (0,1) without colliding with itself or the walls. Let's break it down.

First, let's understand the current state:

- Head is at (8,5), which is near the top-right corner.
- Direction is "UP", so the snake was moving upwards.
- Body cells are a list starting from behind the head to the tail: [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)]. So the snake's body is a vertical line from (8,2) down to (1,2). The tail is at (1,2).

The apple is at (0,1), which is near the bottom-left. To get there from (8,5), the snake needs to move left several times and then down.

But wait, the current direction is "UP", so I can't immediately reverse direction. Since the previous move was UP, the next move cannot be DOWN. So possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT for the first move? Wait no—the current direction is UP, so the next direction can't be DOWN. So options are UP (same), LEFT, or RIGHT.

Wait, according to movement rules: Cannot reverse. If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for others. So from UP, allowed directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

But moving UP again would take the head to (8,6). But wait, the grid is 10x10, with y ranging from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So (8,5) is near the top; moving UP to (8,6) might not be possible because it's out of bounds. Wait no, (8,5) is at x=8, y=5. Moving UP would take y from 5 to 6. Since y can go up to 9, that's fine.

But wait, the grid is defined with (0,0) as bottom-left and (9,9) as top-right. So when moving UP, y increases by 1. So (8,5) moving UP becomes (8,6), which is valid since y=6 is within 0-9.

But let's see if that's safe. If I move UP to (8,6), then the new head would be (8,6). Then I need to check for collisions:

1. Is (8,6) outside grid? No, it's valid.
2. Does (8,6) collide with any BODYi except the tail?

The body cells are [(8,4), (8,3), ..., (1,2)]. So the current head is at (8,5). The next cell in the body is (8,4). If I move UP to (8,6), then new_head is not in the body except possibly the tail. Let's see: Tail is at (1,2), which after moving would be updated, but during collision check, only current state matters.

Wait, no—BODYi are from behind head to tail. So in the initial state, after the move, when checking for collisions, the new_head should not coincide with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn.

But in our case, the tail is at (1,2). If we don't eat an apple, the tail would be removed. So during collision check, only existing cells are considered. The new head is (8,6), which is not in the body cells except possibly the first one? Let's see: Body starts with (8,4), then (8,3), etc. So (8,6) is not part of the body. So moving UP to (8,6) is safe.

But wait, the head was at (8,5). The next cell in the body is (8,4). If I move UP, the new head would be (8,6), which is two cells away from (8,5). So no collision. That seems okay.

However, moving up further might lead to issues because the snake's body could block itself. Let me think about the path.

The apple is at (0,1). From (8,5), that's a big move—left 8 units and down 4 units. The Manhattan distance is 12 steps, but with the snake's body moving, I need to find a clear path without colliding.

Alternative approach: Let's plan a path from (8,5) to (0,1). Since the apple is at (0,1), which is far away, perhaps the optimal path would be to move left as much as possible and then down. But considering the snake's body is in the way.

Wait, let's see: The body starts at (8,4), so moving up from (8,5) to (8,6) is clear. Then maybe continue moving up? But that might not be the most efficient.

Alternatively, since the apple is far left and down, perhaps it's better to move left first.

But current direction is UP; can't go DOWN yet. So options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Moving LEFT from (8,5) would take head to (7,5). Let's check if that's safe.

Body cells after the head are [(8,4), ...], so (7,5) isn't part of the body. So moving LEFT is safe.

But wait, when I move LEFT, what happens to the body? The old head (8,5) becomes the first body cell, and the tail might be removed unless we eat an apple.

In this case, since we're not eating the apple, after moving LEFT, the snake's body would be [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), ..., (2,2), (1,2) ] but the tail would be at (0, something? Wait no—the body is [(8,4), ... (1,2)], so when we move, the old head (8,5) becomes the new first body cell.

Wait, let me think again. The movement steps:

After choosing a direction D:

1. Compute new_head = current head + direction vector.
2. Check collision: if new_head is outside grid or in any BODYi except possibly the tail's next position.
3. If no collision:
   a. Insert old head into body as first element.
   b. If new_head == apple, grow (don't remove tail).
   c. Else, remove last element of body.

So if I move LEFT from (8,5) to (7,5):

- New head is (7,5). Check collisions: it's inside grid and not in the current BODY cells [(8,4), ...], so safe.
- Insert (8,5) into body, making new_body = [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), ..., (1,2) ].
- Since new_head is not apple, remove tail: the last element was (1,2), now removed. So new body is [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) ].

So the new state after moving LEFT would have head at (7,5), body as above. Now, next direction can be any except the reverse of LEFT, which is RIGHT.

Wait no—current direction was UP, and I moved LEFT. So previous direction was UP, new direction is LEFT; allowed because you can't reverse from UP to DOWN but other directions are fine.

Now, after moving LEFT once, let's see where to go next.

I need to get to (0,1), so probably continue moving left or down.

But I'm now at (7,5). Let's try moving LEFT again to (6,5).

Check collision:

- New head is (6,5). Current body cells after inserting old head (7,5) are [ (8,5), ... ]? Wait no—after the first move, the body becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,2), ..., (2,2) ].

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's re-examine:

Original head: (8,5). Body after moving LEFT to (7,5):

- Head becomes (7,5).
- Insert old head (8,5) into body as first element.
- Since new_head is not apple, remove tail (1,2).

So the new body is [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) ].

So the body after first move is 9 cells long. The tail is at (2,2).

Wait, no—original body was 10 cells: [(8,4), (8,3), ..., (1,2)]. After moving LEFT:

- Insert old head (8,5) → new body starts with (8,5).
- Then the rest are original body except last element is removed. So new body is [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) ].

So the tail is now at (2,2). So when I move again from (7,5), say to (6,5):

- New head (6,5). Check collision: not in body [8,5; 8,4; ... ; 2,2], so safe.
- Insert old head (7,5) → new body starts with (7,5).
- Remove tail (2,2), now body is [ (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), ..., (3,2) ].

This seems okay. So moving LEFT again to (6,5).

But wait, I'm not making progress towards the apple because each time I move left in x but y remains 5. The apple is at y=1, which is much lower.

Perhaps after some moves left, I should start moving down.

But let's see: if I keep moving LEFT several times, will that help? Or maybe I need to change direction earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the first move should be UP to (8,6), then continue moving UP further until it's safe to turn.

Wait, but from (8,5) moving UP to (8,6):

- New head is (8,6). Not in body [(8,4), ...], so safe.
- Insert old head into body → new body starts with (8,5).
- Remove tail (1,2).

Now the body is [ (8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2) ].

Next move could be UP again to (8,7). Repeat until can't go further up. Then turn left or right.

But from (8,6), moving UP would take to (8,7); then perhaps continue until y=9, which is the top. But that's a long way and might not help reach (0,1).

Alternatively, perhaps after moving LEFT once, I can start moving DOWN.

Wait, but current direction after first move was LEFT; so next move cannot be RIGHT.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should think of a different approach.

Another idea: Since the apple is at (0,1), which is far left and down, perhaps the snake needs to make a path that goes around its own body without colliding.

But given the current position, maybe it's better to move DOWN first if possible, but initial direction is UP.

Wait no—current direction is UP; can't reverse to DOWN immediately. So options are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.

Perhaps moving UP first and then turning left would be a way to avoid collision with the body.

But let me try planning the moves step by step:

1. Current position: head (8,5), direction UP.
2. Move 1: Choose direction LEFT → new head (7,5). Body becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2) ].
3. Move 2: From (7,5), can choose any except RIGHT. Let's say move DOWN to (7,4).

But wait, can I move DOWN? Because previous direction was LEFT; so allowed directions are LEFT, UP, and maybe DOWN as it's not the reverse of LEFT.

Wait no—reverse of LEFT is RIGHT, so moving DOWN is allowed.

So from (7,5), move DOWN to (7,4). Check collision:

- New head (7,4) not in body [8,5; 8,4; ... ;2,2].

But wait, the body after first move was [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), ..., (3,2), (2,2) ].

So (7,4) is not part of that. So safe to move DOWN.

After moving DOWN:

- Head is at (7,4).
- Insert old head (7,5) into body → new body starts with (7,5).
- Remove tail (2,2). Now body is [ (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), ..., (3,2) ].

Now, next move from (7,4): can't reverse direction. Previous was DOWN; allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP except for the opposite of DOWN, which is UP? Wait no—the rule says cannot choose the reverse direction.

Wait, the current direction after moving DOWN is now DOWN, so next move cannot be UP.

So from (7,4), can choose LEFT, RIGHT, or same direction (DOWN).

But to reach (0,1), we might need to go further down. Let's try moving DOWN again to (7,3).

Check collision: new head (7,3) not in body [7,5; 8,5; ... ;3,2]. So safe.

After move:

- Head at (7,3).
- Insert (7,4) into body → body starts with (7,4).
- Remove tail (3,2). Now body is [ (7,4), (8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2) ] but wait, after removing the last element (3,2), it becomes shorter.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let's track the body properly:

After first move: head (7,5), body [ (8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2) ].

Second move: DOWN to (7,4). Insert (7,5) → body becomes [ (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), ... , (3,2) ].

Third move: DOWN to (7,3). Insert (7,4) → new body starts with (7,4), followed by (7,5), (8,5), etc. Then remove tail (3,2).

So the body is now [ (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2) ] but without the last element.

Wait no—the initial body after first move was 10 cells: [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,2), ... , (2,2)].

After moving DOWN to (7,3):

- Insert old head (7,4) → new body starts with (7,4).
- Then the rest is previous body without last element: [(8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2)].

Wait no—the body after first move was [ (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) ].

After second move (DOWN to 7,4):

- Body becomes [ (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), ..., (3,2) ].

After third move (DOWN to 7,3):

- Insert old head (7,4).
- Remove tail: last element was (3,2).

So new body is [ (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2) ].

This seems okay. Now, I'm at (7,3). Next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN but not UP.

If I continue moving DOWN to (7,2):

- Check collision: new head (7,2) is in the body? Body after third move is [ (7,4), ... , (2,2) ].

Wait, the body includes (2,2). So (7,2) isn't part of it. Wait no—body cells are [(7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,2), ... ]? I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps this step-by-step approach is too time-consuming, and I should instead think about a different strategy. Maybe moving LEFT initially to clear space on the left side.

Alternatively, perhaps the first move should be RIGHT. But that would take head to (9,5). Is that safe?

Wait, (8,5) moving RIGHT is (9,5), which is within grid.

Check collision: body after inserting old head would be [ (8,5), ... ] but new_head is at (9,5), which isn't in the body. So it's safe.

After moving RIGHT:

- Head at (9,5).
- Body becomes [ (8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2) ].
- Remove tail (1,2).

Now, from (9,5), can I move further right? But x is 9, which is the maximum. So next moves can be UP or DOWN or same direction.

But moving UP might take head to (9,6), but that's away from the apple.

Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT and then turning around. Hmm, not sure.

I think I'm stuck trying to find a clear path without colliding with the body. Maybe it's better to try another approach: moving in a way that creates space on the left side by moving left first.

So initial plan:

1. Move LEFT from (8,5) to (7,5). Safe.
2. Then move DOWN to (7,4), safe.
3. Continue moving DOWN until possible to turn left.

But I'm not sure if this is the best way.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving LEFT once, start moving right along y=5 to clear space on the left.

Wait, no—after moving LEFT, x is 7; moving RIGHT would take it back towards higher x but may interfere with the body.

I think I need a better strategy. Maybe simulate the moves step by step:

Move 1: LEFT → (7,5). Body: [ (8,5), (8,4), ..., (2,2) ].

Move 2: DOWN → (7,4). Insert (7,5). Remove tail (2,2). Body: [ (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), ..., (3,2) ].

Move 3: LEFT → (6,4). Check collision: new head (6,4). Not in body. Safe.

Now, move to (6,4).

Body after move:

- Insert old head (7,4).
- Remove tail (3,2). Body: [ (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), ..., (2,2) ].

Move 4: DOWN → (6,3).

Body after move:

- Insert old head (6,4).
- Remove tail (2,2). Body: [ (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), ... , (3,2) ].

Continue this way, moving left and down alternately to navigate towards (0,1).

But honestly, I'm not sure if this will work without eventually colliding with the body. Maybe it's better to consider that the snake needs to make a U-turn or move in a spiral to clear space.

Alternatively, perhaps the first few moves should be LEFT until x=0, then start moving down.

But each time I move left, I have to ensure that the new head doesn't collide with any part of the body.

Another idea: After moving LEFT once, move DOWN several times to lower y-coordinate, then continue moving LEFT towards x=0.

So:

1. Move 1: LEFT → (7,5). Body [8,5; ... ;2,2].

2. Move 2: DOWN → (7,4). Insert (7,5). Remove tail (2,2).

3. Move 3: DOWN → (7,3). Insert (7,4). Remove tail (3,2).

4. Move 4: LEFT → (6,3). Check collision: new head (6,3) not in body.

Proceeding:

5. Move 5: DOWN → (6,2). Insert (6,3). Remove tail (something? Now the tail is at (2,2)).

Wait, after move 4, the body was [7,4; 7,5; ... ; something]. I'm not tracking it correctly.

This seems too time-consuming without a clear path. Maybe I should instead conclude that moving LEFT first, then DOWN, and so on, is the way to go.

But considering the complexity, perhaps the correct answer is to move LEFT, then proceed down and left as needed.

Alternatively, since I'm not making progress, maybe the initial moves are RIGHT to make space on higher x, but that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, let's try moving RIGHT first:

1. Move 1: RIGHT → (9,5). Body [8,5; ... ;2,2].

From here, can move DOWN to (9,4), then continue moving down towards y=1 while moving left when possible.

But from (9,5):

Move 2: DOWN → (9,4). Safe.

Body after move:

- Insert old head (9,5).
- Remove tail (something).

Wait, it's getting too complicated. I think I'm stuck and need to try a different approach.

Perhaps the optimal path is:

1. Move LEFT to (7,5).

2. Then move DOWN until y=4, 3, ..., 1.

But after moving down, can I then move left towards x=0?

Alternatively, maybe make a loop by moving right and up after some point.

I think without a clear simulation, it's hard to say, but perhaps the first move is LEFT.
</think>

The snake should start by moving left to begin creating space on the side closer to the target position. This allows for better maneuverability towards the apple located at (0,1).

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Move Left**: The snake moves from (8,5) to (7,5). This creates space on the left side.
2. **Move Down**: From (7,5), move down to (7,4) to start heading towards the apple's y-coordinate.
3. **Continue Moving Down**: Continue moving down along x=7 until reaching a safe point where turning left is possible.
4. **Turn Left and Move Further**: Once at a lower y-coordinate, turn left to decrease the x-coordinate towards 0.
5. **Adjust Directions as Needed**: As the snake approaches (0,1), adjust moves to navigate around its own body without colliding.

The initial move to the LEFT is crucial to begin clearing space towards the target.

**Answer:**

The first move should be to the LEFT.

## WHAT RESPONSE_1 LOOKS LIKE:
RESPONSE_1 might look like this:
  <think> THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 </think>
  FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of safe moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (8, 5) and whose body cells are in list format [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2)], to eat (or at least get close to) the apple at (0, 1). It's possible that RESPONSE_1 cannot determine a complete safe path to the apple and gives just one or several initial moves.

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". You might see "U", "D", "L", "R" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "U"), "DOWN" (for "D"), "LEFT" (for "L"), "RIGHT" (for "R"); you might see "North", "South", "West", "East" in the text for moves, you should convert them to "UP" (for "North"), "DOWN" (for "South"), "LEFT" (for "West"), "RIGHT" (for "East").
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or no safe initial moves can be performed, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning on path and move planning, return your answer in JSON format: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_OR_SAFE_INITIAL_MOVES_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" } in JSON format.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 is not sufficiently informative on moves to perform (e.g. leading to the apple, or one or several initial safe moves), you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Fourth, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
