========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I have to figure out how to get this snake from (1,9) to eat the apple at (7,2). Let me start by understanding the initial setup.

The head is at (1,9), and the current direction is RIGHT. The body cells are [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7)]. So the snake's body starts from (1,9) going left along y=9, then down to (0,7), and then right a bit.

First, I need to make sure that each move follows the rules. The snake can't reverse direction immediately unless it's on the first move. Also, I have to avoid collisions with the body except when moving into the tail's new position.

Since the head is at (1,9) and the apple is at (7,2), which is pretty far down and to the right. The initial direction is RIGHT, so moving that way seems logical. Let me see how the snake can move without getting stuck or colliding.

If I start by moving RIGHT from (1,9), the new head would be (2,9). But wait, checking the body cells: the tail is at (2,7) and other parts are around that area. So moving to (2,9) might not collide with any body part because the body is on the left side of the grid.

Wait, no, the body starts from (1,9), so the next segment is (0,9). So after the head moves right to (2,9), that's a new position. I need to check if this causes any collision before the body updates.

Since the body isn't in that area yet, it should be safe. Then, inserting the old head (1,9) at the front of the body list and removing the tail if not eating the apple.

But I also have to make sure that after each move, the snake's body remains continuous. So each segment must be adjacent by one cell in x or y.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move RIGHT: (2,9). Now, check if any collision before update.
   - New head is (2,9), which isn't in the body yet, so safe.
   - Insert old head at front: body becomes [(1,9), ...]. Remove tail? No, unless eating apple.

2. Next move: continue RIGHT to (3,9). But wait, the apple is down at (7,2), so maybe moving right isn't the best approach because it's taking me away from the target.

Hmm, that's a mistake. I need to think about direction changes.

Wait, the initial direction is RIGHT, but the apple is below and to the right. So perhaps after moving right a bit, I should start moving DOWN.

But can I change direction? The next move directions are restricted by the current direction. Since it's RIGHT now, the next move can't be LEFT or UP unless it's the first move. Wait, no—can you reverse on the second move? No, the rules say you can't reverse unless it's the first move.

So after moving RIGHT a couple of times, I have to decide whether to switch direction without violating the reversal rule.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN immediately would be better, but since the initial direction is RIGHT, that's not allowed unless it's the first move. Wait, no—the first move can change direction only if it's "NONE". But in this case, the current direction is RIGHT, so the next move can't be LEFT or UP because that would reverse.

Wait, the rules say: If current direction is "UP", you may not choose "DOWN" next; similarly for "LEFT"↔"RIGHT". So if I'm moving RIGHT now, I can't change to LEFT on the next move. But I could change to DOWN or UP?

No, wait, it's about reversing. Moving from RIGHT to LEFT is a reversal because they are opposites. Moving from RIGHT to DOWN is not a reversal—it’s a turn down, which is allowed.

So after moving RIGHT once, I can then choose DOWN as the next direction without any problem because it's not a reversal.

Wait, no—the current direction is RIGHT. The next move directions must follow the rules: you cannot reverse unless it's the first move. So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT, but you can go UP or DOWN as long as it doesn't cause immediate collision.

So perhaps after moving RIGHT once to (2,9), I can then start moving DOWN towards the apple.

But let me check if that's possible. Let's plan a path:

1. Move RIGHT: (2,9). Body becomes [(1,9), ...]. Tail is at (2,7).

Wait, no—the body list provided is [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7)]. So the tail is at (2,7). When I move to (2,9), the new head is there. Then, inserting (1,9) at front: body becomes [(1,9), ...], and then removing the tail unless eating apple.

Wait, no—if I don't eat the apple, I remove the tail, so the body length remains the same.

So after moving to (2,9), the body would be [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7)]? No, wait—the initial body is [BODY1, BODY2, ..., BODYN]. So when I move, I insert the old head at front and then remove the tail.

Wait, maybe it's better to represent this step by step.

Let me try to simulate a few moves:

Initial state:
- Head: (1,9)
- Direction: RIGHT
- Body: [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7)]
- Apple: (7,2)

First move: RIGHT → new_head = (2,9). Check for collisions:

- Is (2,9) outside grid? No.
- Does it collide with body? Body is at [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7)]. So no collision.

So update body: insert old head (1,9) at front → new body is [ (1,9), ... ]. Then remove the tail (since not eating apple). The new body becomes [ (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7) ]? Wait no, because after inserting, the body is [ (1,9), ... current body except head]. Then removing the tail.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

After moving to (2,9):

- The new head is (2,9)
- Insert old head (1,9) at front of body list: so body becomes [ (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7) ]
- Then remove the tail (since not eating apple): so body becomes [ (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]

So new body is 5 segments.

Next move: DOWN → since current direction is RIGHT, but now I'm at (2,9). If I choose DOWN, the new head would be (2,8).

Check collision:

- (2,8): within grid.
- Check if it's in body except possible tail. Body is [ (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]. So no collision.

Update body: insert old head (2,9) at front → [ (2,9), (1,9), ... ] and remove the tail if not eating apple. Since I'm not eating, remove tail: new body is [ (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]

Wait, no—after inserting, the body becomes [ (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ] and then remove the last element to keep length same. So new body is [ (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7) ]

Wait, but initial body had 5 segments after first move. Now after second move, it's back to 5.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe I should plan the path in terms of directions:

From (1,9), need to go to (7,2). So net movement is +6 right and -7 down.

So from x=1 to 7: that's 6 steps to the RIGHT.
From y=9 to 2: that's 7 steps DOWN.

But the snake can't reverse direction immediately. So initial direction is RIGHT, so next move can be UP or DOWN, but not LEFT.

If I start moving RIGHT, then change to DOWN after a couple moves.

Let me try another approach:

1. Move RIGHT as much as possible without getting stuck.
2. Then switch direction to DOWN and proceed towards the apple.

But I have to ensure that the body doesn't block itself.

Alternatively, perhaps moving in a spiral or some pattern around the apple's position could work.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the grid and see what's blocking.

The snake is currently occupying columns 0-2 on y=7 and higher. The apple is at (7,2). So there's a lot of space below and to the right.

So perhaps after moving RIGHT a few times, then move DOWN all the way.

But let me think about how the body would follow:

Each time I move in a new direction, the body segments need to be adjacent. So if I start moving RIGHT from (1,9), then each step right adds a segment on the right.

Once I have moved as far right as possible, perhaps turning DOWN is feasible without reversing.

Wait, but after moving RIGHT, can I then move DOWN?

Yes, because the direction change isn't a reversal. So:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,9)
Move 2: RIGHT → (3,9)
...
Up to 7 times: (8,9). But that's far away from the apple.

But maybe not necessary. Alternatively, moving right until some point and then down.

Alternatively, perhaps a more optimal path is to go right until x=7, but that would require 6 steps right from x=1.

But doing so while avoiding collisions with the body.

Wait, no—the snake's body is on the left side, so as long as I move right, the body can stay behind.

Once I reach (7,9), which is far above the apple, then maybe start moving down.

From (7,9) to (7,2): 7 steps DOWN. But again, need to make sure that each step doesn't collide with the body.

But when moving down from (7,9), the body would follow, but it's all on the left side at y=7 and lower.

So perhaps this path is feasible.

Alternatively, another approach could be to move right until x=5 or something, then start moving down without needing to reverse.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline possible moves step by step:

Move 1: RIGHT → (2,9). Body becomes [(1,9), ... other segments], tail at (2,7).

Move 2: DOWN → (2,8). Check for collision before update.

- (2,8): is it in body? The body after move 1 was [ (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]. So no.

Update body: insert (2,9) at front → [ (2,9), (1,9), ... ] and remove tail if not eating apple. New body is [ (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]

Wait, but length was 5 after first move; now it's back to 6? That can't be right.

No, the initial body has 5 segments. After moving and inserting, it becomes 6, then remove one for same length.

So new body is [ (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7) ]

Move 3: DOWN → (2,7). Check collision:

- (2,7): current tail is at (2,7)? No, after move 1, the body had [(1,9), ...], then after move 2, it's [ (2,9), (1,9), ... ] and tail at (0,7). So moving to (2,7) would be new head.

Is (2,7) in current body? The body is [ (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7) ]. So no, it's not present. So safe.

Update body: insert old head (2,8) at front → [ (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), ... ] and remove tail if not eating apple.

New body is [ (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7) ]

Wait, no—if I'm at (2,7), which was the old tail's position. So inserting the previous head (2,8) and then removing the new tail (if not eating apple). But since I didn't eat, remove the last segment.

So body becomes [ (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8) ]

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to consider that each move adds a new head and removes the tail, keeping the length same unless eating the apple.

But perhaps I should just focus on making progress towards the apple without getting stuck.

Another thought: since the apple is at (7,2), maybe moving right as much as possible without hitting walls or body, then down.

Let me see:

From (1,9):

Move RIGHT to x=7, y=9. That would take 6 steps. But each step needs to be done carefully.

But wait, the snake's body is on the left side at lower y-values, so moving right shouldn't interfere as long as I don't have segments in front.

Once at (7,9), then move DOWN towards (7,2).

Is that possible?

From (7,9):

Each step down would add a segment below. The snake's body is on the left side, mostly around y=7 and lower.

So when moving from (7,9) to (7,8), etc., I don't expect collisions because the body is on the left.

But I have to make sure that each new head position doesn't collide with any existing body segments except possibly the tail.

Wait, but after moving right to (7,9), the body would be extending behind me. So when I move down, I need to ensure that the new head doesn't hit any body parts.

But as I'm moving down from (7,9), the body is on the left side, so probably safe.

So maybe this path is feasible:

1. Move RIGHT 6 times: each time, check if it's safe.
2. Then move DOWN 7 times.

Let me try to simulate a few more moves.

After Move 1: (2,9)
Move 2: (3,9)
...
Move 6: (7,9). Now at x=7, y=9.

Body after each move:

Each time moving RIGHT, insert the previous head and remove tail. So body would be [ (previous head), ... , original tail ].

But perhaps this is getting too detailed. Let me assume that moving right to (7,9) is possible without collision.

Then from there, moving DOWN 7 times:

Move 7: (7,8)
Move 8: (7,7)
...
Move 13: (7,2). Arrived at the apple.

But wait, I need to check if each move causes a collision before updating the body.

Each step down would be safe because the body is on the left side.

So in total, 6 moves RIGHT and 7 moves DOWN, totaling 13 moves.

Is there any point where moving down would cause the head to collide with the body?

Since the body is behind, I think it's safe.

But let me confirm:

After moving to (7,8), check if (7,8) is in body. The body after 6 RIGHT moves would have inserted each previous head and removed the tail. So the body would be [ (1,9), (2,9), ..., (7,9) ] but that can't be since we are removing tails.

Wait no—each move inserts the old head at front and removes the last segment of body. So after 6 RIGHT moves, the body is:

[ (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]? No, because each move adds a new head.

Wait I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to represent the body as a list and see how it grows.

Let me try:

Initial body: [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7)]

After first RIGHT move:

- Insert (1,9) at front → [ (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7) ]
- Remove tail (since not eating apple): [ (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]

Second move: RIGHT → (3,9). Insert previous head (2,9):

[ (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7) ]
Remove tail: [ (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7) ]

Third move: RIGHT → (4,9). Insert (3,9):

[ (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7) ]
Remove tail: [ (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8) ]

Fourth move: RIGHT → (5,9). Insert (4,9):

[ (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8) ]
Remove tail: [ (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9) ]

Fifth move: RIGHT → (6,9). Insert (5,9):

[ (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9) ]
Remove tail: [ (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9) ]

Sixth move: RIGHT → (7,9). Insert (6,9):

[ (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9) ]
Remove tail: [ (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9) ]

So after six RIGHT moves, the body is:

[ (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9) ]

Now, moving down from (7,9):

Move 7: DOWN → (7,8). Check if in body. Body has [ (6,9), ... , (2,9) ]. So (7,8) is not present.

Insert previous head (7,9) at front:

[ (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9) ]
Remove tail (if not eating apple). Wait, after six RIGHT moves, the body had 5 segments. After this move, it becomes 6.

But since we didn't eat the apple yet, remove the last segment: [ (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9) ]

Move 8: DOWN → (7,7). Check if in body. Body is [ (7,9), ... , (3,9) ]. So no.

Insert previous head (7,8):

[ (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9) ]
Remove tail: [ (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9) ]

Continue this process until reach y=2.

Each step down would add the previous position at front and remove the last segment. Since we're not eating the apple, each move reduces body length by 1.

After 7 moves DOWN from (7,9):

We end up at (7,2). Each step is safe as long as the new head doesn't collide with existing body except possibly the tail.

So yes, this seems possible.

Therefore, the minimal number of moves would be 6 RIGHT and 7 DOWN, totaling 13 moves.

But let me check if there's a way to reach the apple in fewer steps by combining moves or taking shortcuts. However, since movement is only right or down, and we need to move from (1,9) to (7,2), it can't be done faster than 6+7=13 moves.

So I think that's the minimal number of moves.
</think>

The minimum number of moves required for the snake to reach the apple at (7,2) is 13. The path involves moving right six times and down seven times without colliding with the body except at the tail, as each segment follows the head.

**Answer:** The minimum number of moves is \boxed{13}.
