{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move 4 units right (from x=1 to x=5) and 1 unit down (from y=7 to y=6). Starting with the current direction 'RIGHT', moving right four times avoids collisions with the body (which is initially positioned left and below the head). After reaching (5,7), moving down to (5,6) reaches the apple. Each step checks for safe positions (within bounds and not colliding with body segments), ensuring the path is valid."
