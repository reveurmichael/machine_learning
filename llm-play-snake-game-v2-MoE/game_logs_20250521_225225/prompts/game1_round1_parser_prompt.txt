<think>
Alright, I'm faced with this Snake game problem where I need to help the snake get from (5,5) to eat an apple at (7,6). The initial direction is NONE, meaning any move is allowed. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll note down the current position: head at (5,5), and body is empty since it's given as an empty list. The apple is at (7,6). From my understanding, to reach the apple, the snake needs to move right twice and up once because 7-5=2 in x-direction and 6-5=1 in y-direction.

Since the snake can't reverse direction on its first move, but since it's starting from NONE, any of the four directions are allowed. So, I should plan a path that doesn't require reversing immediately after moving towards the apple.

Looking at the movement rules, each time the head moves forward, the tail follows unless it eats the apple. Since there's no body yet, the snake will just grow by one segment when eating the apple. Also, collisions with walls or its own body are deadly, so I need to make sure every move keeps the snake within bounds and doesn't cause a collision.

Let me plan the path:

1. Move RIGHT: from (5,5) to (6,5). This is valid because it's going towards increasing x.
2. Next, can we move RIGHT again? Wait, since direction was initially NONE, moving RIGHT is allowed. But after that, if I try to go RIGHT again, would that be a reversal? No, only the first move from NONE counts as reversing. So, yes, two consecutive RIGHTs are okay.

Wait, but actually, no: according to rule 3, the snake can't reverse direction on the next step. But since the initial direction is NONE, moving RIGHT and then RIGHT again is allowed because it's not a reversal after the first move. So that should be fine.

So:
1. Move RIGHT → (6,5)
2. Move RIGHT again? Wait, but from (6,5), moving right would take us to (7,5). Then we need to go up once to get to (7,6).

Wait, let's check:

From (6,5) direction is RIGHT, next move can't be LEFT because that's a reversal. So after RIGHT, the allowed moves are UP, DOWN, or NONE again.

So from (6,5), moving RIGHT again would make it (7,5). Then from there, to get to (7,6), we need to go UP once.

But then checking for collisions:

At each step, check if the new head position is valid and not overlapping with any body parts. Initially, the body is empty, so only the walls are a concern.

1. Initial move RIGHT: (5,5) → (6,5). Valid.
2. Next, moving RIGHT again would be from (6,5) to (7,5). But wait, after moving RIGHT once, direction is now RIGHT; can we move RIGHT again? Since the last direction was RIGHT, reversing it isn't allowed unless it's the initial NONE.

Wait no: The rule says that if direction is UP, it cannot reverse to DOWN next. So from RIGHT, you can go LEFT in the next step as long as it's not going back immediately.

But wait, the movement rules say:

The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). If the direction is NONE, any move is allowed.

So after a RIGHT, moving LEFT would be reversing? Because it's opposite in x-direction. But according to rule 3, can you go from RIGHT to LEFT?

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The example given says that if going UP, cannot move DOWN next; similarly for other directions. So each direction is considered as a vector, and moving in the exact reverse would be a reversal.

So moving FROM RIGHT (vector (1,0)) to LEFT (-1,0) is reversing because it's directly opposite.

But rule 3 says: The snake **cannot** reverse direction (e.g., if going UP, cannot move DOWN next). So I think that means you can't switch from UP to DOWN or vice versa. But does moving from RIGHT to LEFT count as a reversal?

Wait, in the problem statement, it's not clearly specified whether changing x-direction counts as reversing. It only gives an example with vertical directions (UP and DOWN), but perhaps for horizontal directions too.

But per rule 3, it says that if direction is "UP", cannot move "DOWN" next. Similarly, moving RIGHT can be followed by LEFT? Or is that considered a reversal?

I think the answer lies in whether the new direction is directly opposite or not. For example:

- From RIGHT (x+1), moving LEFT (-x) would be direct reverse; hence it's a reversal.
- So perhaps any change of horizontal direction from RIGHT to LEFT or vice versa counts as reversing.

Wait, but rule 3 says "snake cannot reverse direction". So if the current direction is RIGHT, you can't move LEFT next. Or maybe only certain directions?

Hmm, this needs clarification.

The initial movement could be anything because it's NONE. Then subsequent moves are constrained by previous direction and cannot go directly opposite? Maybe not.

Wait, rule 3 says: "The snake **cannot** reverse direction on its next step."

But the example given is when moving UP, you can't move DOWN. So perhaps in terms of vertical directions only; for horizontal, same applies?

So if moving RIGHT (x+1), then moving LEFT (-x) would be considered a reversal and thus prohibited.

If that's the case, after moving RIGHT to (6,5), from there, I cannot immediately move LEFT because it would reverse direction. So in this case, what are my options for next steps?

From (6,5), possible moves:

- UP: (7,6) → which is our target.
- DOWN: (6,4)
- RIGHT: (7,5)
- NONE: doesn't change direction.

But moving from RIGHT to RIGHT again would be allowed since you're going in the same direction. Wait no—right after moving RIGHT once, next move could still be RIGHT as it's not a reversal of itself.

Wait, but wait; perhaps I'm misapplying rule 3 because right is only one possible x-direction; maybe once you've moved in any horizontal direction, changing to another isn't allowed?

No, the example says UP and DOWN are prohibited next steps if moving from UP or DOWN. So probably for each movement step, after a certain direction, some other directions may be prohibited.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that if your previous direction was RIGHT (vector (1,0)), then you cannot move LEFT (-x) as it would reverse the x-direction.

But perhaps in this problem statement, moving from RIGHT can still allow another RIGHT movement since same direction is not considered a reversal. So, for example:

- Moving RIGHT once: allowed.
- Then again RIGHT: allowed because same direction, no reversal.
- But then you cannot move LEFT (because it's reverse of RIGHT).

But wait, perhaps rule 3 says that after moving in one direction, the next step can't be directly opposite.

In that case, let me try to outline possible paths:

Option 1:
Move RIGHT twice and UP once. Is this possible without reversing?

Path:
(5,5) → RIGHT → (6,5)
Then from (6,5), since previous move was RIGHT, next cannot be LEFT or maybe any other direction? Wait no—if you've moved RIGHT to get here, can you then move RIGHT again? Because same direction.

Wait: The rule says that the snake **cannot** reverse its direction on its next step. So moving in the same direction is allowed as it's not a reversal.

So from (6,5), if previous was RIGHT, you could still choose to move RIGHT again or any other non-reversing directions except opposite of current direction?

Wait no—if your last movement was RIGHT, then you cannot reverse it by moving LEFT next. So in this case, can I do:

1. Move RIGHT → (6,5)
2. From there, perhaps change direction to UP? Because moving from RIGHT to UP is a turn.

So after RIGHT, the next move could be either RIGHT again or another non-reversing movement like UP or DOWN or NONE.

Wait, but wait: if current direction was RIGHT, then can you switch to any other direction except for LEFT (which would reverse x-direction). So moving from RIGHT, possible directions are:

- RIGHT
- UP
- DOWN
- NONE

So I think that's correct. Because only the exact opposite is a reversal.

So perhaps after first move RIGHT, second move could be RIGHT or UP or DOWN or none.

But since I need to get to (7,6), which requires two Rights and one Up, maybe this path would work:

(5,5) → RIGHT → (6,5)

Then from (6,5):

If the last direction was RIGHT, can we move RIGHT again? Let's check if that leads us towards our target.

So moving RIGHT to (7,5). Then next step: move Up to (7,6).

This would require two moves:

First move: RIGHT
Second move: RIGHT → to (7,5)
Third move: UP → to (7,6)

Now, check if any of these steps result in a reversal.

From initial NONE, moving Right is allowed. Then from there, moving Right again would be same direction—no problem with reversal.

Then, after that, moving Up next. From the last direction being RIGHT, can we move UP? Yes because it's not directly opposite; it's changing x to y direction. So no reversal occurs here.

So this seems feasible:

1. Move RIGHT → (6,5)
2. Move RIGHT → (7,5)
3. Move UP → (7,6)

But wait: from step 2, we are at (7,5). Now the last direction was RIGHT again. So when moving to Up next, it's a left turn—it doesn't reverse any previous movement.

So this seems allowed. Let me check for each move:

1. Step 1: from (5,5) to (6,5): last direction is RIGHT. Next step could be any non-reversed, so yes.
2. Step 2: from (6,5) to (7,5): same as above. Last direction RIGHT again—can move RIGHT or other directions except LEFT.
3. Step 3: from (7,5), last direction was RIGHT; can we move UP? Yes.

Wait but after moving twice RIGHT, the next step is UP without reversing any previous direction.

But wait, if I'm at (7,5) and my last direction was RIGHT—could I have other options besides RIGHT or UPM Down or NONE?

Yes. But in this case, moving Up leads us to target.

So does that mean that the path is possible?

Alternatively, perhaps we can move Up first:

1. Move UP → from (5,5) to (6,6)
But then, how do we get to 7 on x? Maybe have more steps... But seems longer than necessary.

I think moving Right twice and then Up once would be better.

So the sequence is RIGHT, RIGHT, UP: leads directly to target.

Another approach could be:

1. Move RIGHT → (6,5)
2. Then change direction to DOWN or something else—but no, that wouldn't help us reach (7,6).

Wait: But if we move Right twice and then Up once, as above, is the path possible without any reversals?

Yes.

So let's outline this in code steps:

current_position = (5,5)
directions = [RIGHT, RIGHT, UP]

But wait, according to rules, after each step, you can't reverse direction on next move. So from initial NONE, right is allowed; then again right; then up—since no reversal.

Yes, that should work without any issues.

So perhaps the minimal number of moves would be 3: two rights and one up.

But wait, let me check:

Wait (5,5) + RIGHT → (6,5): step1.
From there, move RIGHT again to (7,5): step2. Now last direction was RIGHT. Can we move Up? Yes—no reversal required because moving from x-direction to y-direction is not a reversal.

So yes, three steps: right, right, up.

Therefore, the minimal number of steps would be 3 moves.

But wait, in some snake movement rules, turning may require that you can't make sharp turns; but this problem's rule says only about reversing. So it seems we are allowed to change direction as needed, as long as previous step isn't directly opposite.

So I think the plan is correct: three steps.

Wait no—wait a moment:

In the first move, from (5,5) to (6,5): last_dir = RIGHT.
Second move, from (6,5) to (7,5): last_dir still RIGHT. So moving Right again is allowed because same direction as previous step—no reversal.

Third move: From (7,5), we can now change direction to Up since it's not directly opposite (i.e., x to y is a turn, not a reversal). So yes, that's allowed. Hence three steps needed.

So the answer would be 3 moves?

But wait, let me check whether in each step there are no issues with moving beyond boundaries or not.

From (5,5) moving Right: (6,5): valid.
Then to (7,5): x is now 7—valid since we're at the edge. Then Up to (7,6): y becomes 6—valid if 6 <= max_y? Assuming that's allowed.

Wait, perhaps there are no walls mentioned here; problem seems abstracted so you can move in any direction as long as it's not a reversal and within grid?

Alternatively, maybe the grid is considered unbounded except for movement constraints. So as per given rules, three steps would work without needing to consider boundaries beyond that.

Thus, with this reasoning, the minimal number of moves required is 3: two rights followed by an up.

But perhaps I should model it more carefully step-by-step:

1st move: RIGHT → (6,5)
Last direction: RIGHT
2nd move: RIGHT again? Since moving same direction—allowed because no reversal. So now at (7,5)
3rd move: change to UP from (7,5) → reach (7,6)

Yes.

So this seems correct.
</think>

The problem involves navigating a grid where each step is subject to specific movement constraints. The goal is to determine the minimal number of moves required to reach a target position while adhering to these constraints.

1. **Movement Rules**: You can move in any direction except directly reversing your previous step (i.e., if you moved right, you cannot move left next). However, turning or moving sideways without reversing is allowed.
2. **Target Position**: Starting at (5,5), the target is (7,6).
3. **Path Analysis**:
   - Moving Right twice brings us to (7,5).
   - From there, a Upward move reaches the target.

Thus, three moves are sufficient: two rights and one up.

$\boxed{3}$
