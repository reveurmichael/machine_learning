========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to help this snake eat the apple without dying. So, the head is at (6,1), and the apple is just one step to the right at (7,1). That seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that moving right is safe.

First, looking at the current direction: it's RIGHT. Oh wait, according to rule 3, the snake can't reverse direction immediately. So if the current direction is RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT because that would reverse. But in this case, moving RIGHT again isn't reversing; it's just continuing in the same direction. Wait no, actually, the movement rules say that each move must be a valid direction without reversing. So since the snake was moving right, the next direction can't be left if that would reverse. But wait, the current direction is RIGHT, so possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again, as LEFT would reverse.

Wait no, I think rule 3 says you cannot reverse direction on each move. So for example, if the snake is moving UP, it can't next move DOWN because that's reversing. But in this case, current direction is RIGHT. The possible moves are any except NONE unless the current direction is NONE. Wait, no: when direction is not NONE, the next direction cannot be opposite. So from RIGHT, you can't go LEFT on the next move. Because LEFT would be the reverse of RIGHT.

Wait, but in this case, the apple is directly to the right. So moving right again seems possible. Let me check the body cells. The body is [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]. So from head at (6,1), moving right would take it to (7,1), which is the apple's position. But wait, after eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment. So the body becomes [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] and the tail doesn't move because the apple was eaten.

But wait, let's think about collision. When moving from head to (7,1), which is the apple's position, will that new head collide with any body part? The current body includes cells up to (5,1). So (6,1) is the head, and then the body parts are down to (5,1). So if the head moves right to (7,1), there's no collision because none of the body parts are at (7,1). Wait, actually, after moving, the new head is (7,1), and the body would shift. The previous head (6,1) becomes part of the body.

So when the snake moves right to (7,1), it's eating the apple, so it grows, meaning that the tail doesn't move. So the new body would be [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]. The head is now at (7,1). So the next step after eating the apple would be to check if there's a safe move.

Wait, but according to rule 4, after moving, the snake must not die. So when we make a move that leads to the apple, we have to ensure that after eating, the snake isn't in a position where it can't move further without colliding with itself or going out of bounds.

But in this case, after eating the apple at (7,1), the next step could be any direction except for reversing. Wait, no: the current direction after moving right would be RIGHT again because we just moved that way. So the next move can't be LEFT as it's the reverse.

Wait, but the problem says to plan a sequence of moves leading to eating the apple, not necessarily what comes after. But according to the constraints, after eating the apple, ensure there's at least one legal move afterward. So after moving to (7,1) and eating the apple, we need to have at least one possible next move.

Looking at the grid, from (7,1), possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT, or LEFT, but considering the body parts. Let's see:

After eating the apple, the snake's head is at (7,1). The body is now [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]. So the next move can't go into any of these cells.

If we try to move RIGHT from (7,1) again: new head would be at (8,1). Is that safe? It's within grid bounds. The body parts up to (6,1) are okay because (8,1) isn't part of the body. So moving right is possible.

Alternatively, other directions could be considered as well.

Wait, but in this case, after eating the apple, the snake needs to have at least one move left. Since moving right again is possible, that's acceptable.

But let's check if there are any obstacles when moving directly right. The body parts from (6,1) down to (5,1), etc., so no conflicts.

So the path seems safe: just move RIGHT once to eat the apple. But wait, I need to make sure that after eating the apple, the snake can still move at least one step. So when the head is at (7,1), moving right would take it to (8,1). Is there any collision? The body parts are up to (6,1), so no. Therefore, this seems safe.

But wait, the initial direction is RIGHT. So can we move again in the same direction without reversing?

Yes, because the next move isn't a reversal; it's continuing in the same direction.

So the moves would be ["RIGHT"], which takes the head from (6,1) to (7,1), eating the apple.

But wait, let me make sure that this is allowed. The movement rules say that after moving RIGHT, the next move can't be LEFT unless it's NONE. But since in this case, the direction is RIGHT, and we're moving again in the same direction, that's fine.

So the sequence would just be one move: ["RIGHT"], which takes the head to (7,1), eats the apple, and then after that, the snake can move further if needed, but for the purpose of this problem, we only need to reach the apple. So the moves list is just one step.
</think>

The snake is currently at (6,1) with the apple directly to its right. Moving right will allow it to eat the apple without collision.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving RIGHT from (6,1) leads directly to the apple at (7,1) without colliding with the body or walls."
}
```
