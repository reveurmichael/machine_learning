<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to get the snake from (6,6) to the apple at (4,2). The head is currently moving up, and the body has two segments: (6,4) and (6,5). So the snake is in a vertical line going up.

First, I need to calculate the Manhattan distance between the current position and the apple. The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates. From (6,6) to (4,2), the x difference is 2 and the y difference is 4. So total distance is 6, which is pretty far.

But wait, since the snake can't reverse direction immediately, I have to consider that the first move can't be down because the current direction is up. The movement options are left, right, or up for the first move.

Looking at the required moves: we need more LEFTs than RIGHTs by 2 (since 6-4=2) and more DOWNs than UPs by 4 (since 6-2=4). So overall, the snake needs to go left twice more than right, and down four times more than up.

Starting from (6,6), moving left might be a good idea because we need to decrease x by 2. But I also have to consider that after each move, the body segments will shift. The current body is [(6,4), (6,5)], so if we move in any direction, the tail will follow but only stay if we eat an apple.

Hmm, right now, the snake's body is behind it, so moving left would mean that after moving, the new position (5,6) needs to not collide with the body. But wait, the body is at (6,4) and (6,5). So moving left to (5,6) wouldn't conflict because the body is below.

But let's plan step by step. The first move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. Since we need to go left, maybe starting with a LEFT move makes sense.

Wait, but from (6,6), if I move LEFT to (5,6). Then the next head position would be (5,6), and the body would update: the old head (6,6) becomes part of the body, so the new body is [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]. Wait no—the movement updates as follows: the new head is added, and the tail moves unless an apple is eaten. Since we haven't eaten the apple yet, the tail will move.

Wait, but in this case, after moving LEFT, the snake's body would be [(6,4), (6,5)] plus the new position? Or does the tail get removed?

No, when you move without eating an apple, the tail is removed. So if I move from (6,6) to (5,6), the old head (6,6) becomes part of the body, but since we didn't eat the apple, the tail (which was at (6,4)) would be removed. Wait no—the body cells are given as [(6,4), (6,5)], which is two segments. So after moving to (5,6), the new head is (5,6). The body becomes [(6,5)] because we add (6,6) but then remove the tail, which was (6,4).

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the body updates. Let me clarify:

- When you move without eating an apple:
  - New head is added to the front.
  - The tail is removed.

So if the body is [(6,4), (6,5)] and the head is at (6,6), when moving LEFT to (5,6):

- New head: (5,6)
- Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ]? Or does the previous head become part of the body?

Wait no—when you move, the old head becomes part of the body only if you eat an apple. Otherwise, it just moves.

So initial state:

Head: (6,6)
Body: [(6,4), (6,5)]

After moving LEFT to (5,6):

- New head: (5,6)
- Body: The old head (6,6) is added? Or does the body shift?

No, I think when you move without eating, the tail is removed. So the new body would be [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) ] but then we remove the tail (6,4). Wait no—the tail is always moving unless an apple is eaten.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that when you move, the head moves, and all body segments follow. The tail gets cut off if there's no apple eaten.

So after a normal move:

- Head moves to new position.
- Each body segment follows the previous one.
- Tail is removed unless an apple was eaten in the last move.

In this case, since we haven't eaten the apple yet, the tail will be removed. So from [(6,4), (6,5)] and head at (6,6):

Move LEFT to (5,6). The new body would then be [ (6,5), (6,6) ] because (6,4) is removed.

So now the body is [(6,5), (6,6)], which is two segments again.

Wait, no—since after moving, the head becomes part of the body unless we ate an apple. So initial body is two cells; moving to a new cell without eating makes the body three cells? Or does it shift and drop the tail?

I think when you move, the snake's body shifts so that each segment follows the next one. The head moves forward, and the last segment (tail) is removed unless an apple was eaten.

So for example:

- Initial state: Head at H, body segments B1, B2.
- Move to new position H':
  - New head is H'.
  - Body becomes [H, B1].
  - Tail (B2) is removed if no apple eaten.

Wait that can't be right because in the initial problem statement, after moving, the tail is removed unless an apple was eaten. So:

- If you move and eat an apple: body grows by one segment.
- If you don't eat: tail is removed; body remains same length.

So, for example:

Initial head: (6,6)
Body: [ (6,4), (6,5) ]

After moving LEFT to (5,6):

- Since no apple eaten yet, the body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ] because we add (6,6) as the new tail and remove (6,4).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to model each step.

But perhaps this is complicating things too much. Let me think of a possible path.

From (6,6), current direction is UP. So the next move cannot be DOWN because we can't reverse direction on the first move.

We need to go LEFT twice and DOWN four times more than up. Since from (6,6) to (4,2), x decreases by 2 and y decreases by 4.

So, let's plan a path that goes left, then down, but I have to make sure that each move doesn't cause collision with the body or go out of bounds.

Let me list possible moves step by step:

1. Current position: (6,6), direction UP. Next move can be LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

If I move LEFT first:
- New head: (5,6)
- Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ] because the tail (6,4) is removed.
- Now, the next moves can't reverse direction from LEFT. So possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.

Wait, but after moving LEFT, the current direction becomes LEFT for the next move. Because each move changes the direction.

So first move: LEFT → new direction is LEFT.

Now, to get down by 4 and left by 2 more, I need to go further left once more.

But let's see:

After moving LEFT to (5,6), can we move LEFT again?

No, because that would require another LEFT move. But from (5,6) direction is LEFT, so the next possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, or UP.

Wait no—the current direction after first move becomes LEFT, so for the next move, you can't go RIGHT.

So:

Move 1: LEFT → position (5,6), direction LEFT.
Body now is [(6,5), (6,6)]? Or wait, initial body was [ (6,4), (6,5) ]. After moving to (5,6), the new head is (5,6). The old head becomes part of the body only if we ate an apple. Since we didn't, the body is now [ (6,5), (6,6) ].

Wait no—the snake's body after each move without eating will drop the tail. So initial body is [(6,4), (6,5)]. After moving LEFT to (5,6):

- The new head is (5,6).
- The old body segments are [ (6,5), (6,6) ] because we add (6,6) and remove (6,4). Or is it that the body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ], which is two segments.

Wait no—snake's length remains the same unless eating. So initial snake has 3 cells: head at (6,6), body at (6,5), and (6,4). Wait no—the body is given as [(6,4), (6,5)], so it's a 2-segment body plus the head, making a total of 3 cells.

When you move without eating, the snake moves forward, adding a new head and dropping the tail. So:

After moving LEFT to (5,6):

- New head: (5,6)
- Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ] because we add (6,6) as part of the body but remove (6,4).

So now, the snake's body is [(6,5), (6,6)], and the head is at (5,6). So next move can't be RIGHT because that would reverse direction.

Wait no—the first move was LEFT, so the current direction is LEFT. The next moves can't be RIGHT unless allowed otherwise.

So from (5,6) with direction LEFT:

Possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, or UP.

If I move DOWN again, to (5,5):

- New head: (5,5)
- Direction is now DOWN.
- Body becomes [ (6,5), (5,6) ] and then we add the new head (5,5). Wait no—body after moving down would be:

After moving LEFT to (5,6), body was [(6,5), (6,6)]. Now moving DOWN from (5,6):

- New head: (5,5)
- Body becomes [ (6,5), (5,6) ]
But wait, the movement is that each segment follows. So when you move down, the old head (5,6) becomes part of the body, but we add it as the new tail? Or does it shift?

I think this is getting too complicated; perhaps I should look for a path that doesn't immediately lead to collision.

Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN first isn't possible because current direction is UP and can't reverse on first move. So first move can be LEFT or RIGHT.

Wait, the initial movement rules say you cannot reverse direction unless it's NONE. Since the current direction is UP, the next move cannot be DOWN. So from (6,6), possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

If I choose to go LEFT first:

Move 1: LEFT → (5,6)
Now, direction is LEFT.

Next move can't be RIGHT.

We need to reach (4,2). Let's see the path after moving LEFT twice and DOWN four times.

But maybe a better approach is to calculate the required number of moves. From (6,6) to (4,2):

Δx = -2 → needs two LEFTs.
Δy = -4 → needs four DOWNs.

Total moves needed: 6 moves, with two LEFTs and four DOWNs.

But also, after each move, we have to make sure that the snake doesn't collide with itself or go out of bounds.

Another approach is to find a path that avoids collisions. Let's think about moving in such a way that we don't loop back towards our body.

Let me try:

Move 1: LEFT → (5,6)
Body after this move would be [(6,5), (6,6)]

Now, from (5,6), can I move DOWN? Yes, direction is now LEFT; next move can be LEFT, UP, or DOWN. So moving DOWN to (5,5):

Move 2: DOWN → (5,5)
Body becomes [ (6,5), (5,6) ]

Now, from (5,5), direction is DOWN.

Next move can't be UP unless we change direction.

Wait no—current direction after Move 2 is DOWN. So next moves cannot be UP.

From (5,5), possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But we need to go further down and left.

Move 3: LEFT → (4,5)
Direction now LEFT.
Body becomes [ (6,5), (5,6) ] → Wait no, when moving LEFT from (5,5):

- New head is (4,5)
- Body was [ (6,5), (5,6) ]

Wait, this might be causing collision. Because after Move 3, the new body would be [(5,6), (4,5)]? Or does it shift?

I'm getting stuck here; maybe I should try a different initial move.

Alternative approach: Maybe moving DOWN first isn't possible because current direction is UP and can't reverse on first move. So first move must be LEFT or RIGHT.

If I go RIGHT first:

Move 1: RIGHT → (7,6)
Direction becomes RIGHT.

But from (7,6), to reach (4,2), we need to go left three more times (since 7-4=3) and down four times. But that's more than the required two LEFTs. Hmm, but initially, we only needed two LEFTs, so maybe this path is worse.

Alternatively, moving UP first:

Move 1: UP → (6,7)
But then from there, need to go left twice and down five times, which seems longer.

Wait, let me think again about the required number of moves. The total displacement is Δx = -2, Δy = -4, so we need at least 6 moves. Let's try:

Move 1: LEFT → (5,6)
Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Move 2: DOWN → (5,5)
Body becomes [ (6,5), (5,6) ] and new head is (5,5). But wait, the body after moving down would be [ (5,6), (6,5) ]? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe move in a spiral or some other way to avoid collision.

Another approach: Plan a path that goes from (6,6) → LEFT twice and DOWN four times.

But need to ensure each step doesn't hit the body.

Let me try:

Move 1: LEFT → (5,6)
Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Move 2: DOWN → (5,5)
Now, from (5,5), direction is DOWN. Next move can be DOWN again, but we need to avoid hitting the body.

Wait, after Move 1, the body was [ (6,5), (6,6) ].

After Move 2, moving DOWN to (5,5):

- New head: (5,5)
- Body becomes [ (5,6), (6,5) ]

Because when you move down from (5,6) to (5,5), the old head (5,6) is now part of the body, and the previous segments are adjusted.

So body after Move 2: [ (5,6), (6,5) ]

Now, can I move DOWN again?

Move 3: DOWN → (5,4)
Body becomes [ (5,5), (5,6) ]? Or is it that we add (5,4) as new head and drop the tail.

Wait no—each time you move without eating, the body shifts. So after Move 1:

Head: (5,6)

Body segments: [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

After Move 2: Head is (5,5). Body becomes [ (5,6), (6,5) ].

After Move 3: Head is (5,4). Body becomes [ (5,5), (5,6) ].

So no collision here.

Continue:

Move 4: DOWN → (5,3)
Body: [ (5,4), (5,5) ]

Move 5: LEFT → (4,3)
But wait, current direction is DOWN. So after Move 3 and 4, direction remains DOWN. To move LEFT now would require a change in direction.

Wait, no—each move changes the direction to the new one. So from direction DOWN, moving DOWN again keeps the same direction? Or does it just continue moving down.

I think each move's direction is determined by where you choose to go next. So after each move, the direction becomes the direction of the movement.

So:

Move 1: LEFT → direction LEFT

Move 2: DOWN → direction DOWN

Move 3: DOWN → direction DOWN (but that seems redundant)

Wait no—after moving DOWN once, the direction is DOWN; moving again in the same direction continues it.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline the moves:

1. LEFT from (6,6) → (5,6)
   - Body: [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

2. DOWN from (5,6) → (5,5)
   - Direction is now DOWN
   - Body: [ (5,6), (6,5) ]

3. LEFT from (5,5) → (4,5)
   - Can't move RIGHT because that would reverse direction.
   - New head: (4,5)
   - Body becomes [ (5,5), (5,6) ] and the new head is added.

Wait no—when moving LEFT, the body shifts:

After Move 3, head is (4,5). The previous segments were [ (5,5), (5,6) ], but actually, when you move LEFT, the old head becomes part of the body. So after Move 2, head was (5,5); moving LEFT to (4,5):

- Body segments would be [ (5,5), (5,6) ] → then adding new head (4,5) and dropping tail?

Wait no—the snake's body is a list where each move shifts the entire body.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to try a different approach: find a path that doesn't require immediate left turns and might be collision-free.

Alternatively, think about moving in such a way that you clear enough space before turning.

Another idea: Since from (6,6) we need to go down four times and left twice, perhaps move down first as much as possible without hitting the body, then turn left.

But wait, current direction is UP; can't reverse on first move. So first move must be LEFT or RIGHT.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first?

Wait no—current direction is UP, so next move cannot be DOWN unless it's allowed.

Wait, initial direction is UP. First move options: LEFT, RIGHT, UP (but moving UP again would just keep going in the same direction).

But perhaps that's okay.

Let me try:

Move 1: UP → (6,7)
Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ] after dropping the tail?

Wait no—head was at (6,6). Moving up to (6,7):

- New head: (6,7)
- Body segments become [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Now, from (6,7), direction is UP. Next move can't be DOWN.

We need to go down four times and left twice. So:

Move 2: LEFT → (5,7)

Body becomes [ (6,6), (6,7) ]?

Wait, no—each movement adds a new head and drops the tail unless eating an apple.

After Move 1, body is [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

After Move 2: LEFT → (5,7)

- New head: (5,7)
- Body becomes [ (6,6), (6,7) ]

Wait, but the initial body was [ (6,5), (6,6) ].

When you move up to (6,7):

- Head is (6,7)
- Body remains [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Then moving LEFT:

- New head: (5,7)
- The previous segments would be [ (6,7), (6,6) ].

Wait I'm getting confused again. Maybe it's better to try to outline the path without worrying too much about the body, as long as we don't hit any cells that are part of our own body.

But this seems difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps a better strategy is to move in such a way that after each LEFT or DOWN, you have enough space.

For example:

Move 1: LEFT → (5,6)
Body becomes [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Now from (5,6):

Move 2: DOWN → (5,5)
Body becomes [ (5,6), (6,5) ]

From (5,5):

Move 3: LEFT → (4,5)
But need to check if this is safe.

After Move 1 and 2:

At Move 2, body is [ (5,6), (6,5) ]. So at (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5): does that position collide with any part of the body?

The body after Move 2 was [ (5,6), (6,5) ], which are positions (5,6) and (6,5). The new head is (4,5); none of these positions overlap, so it's safe.

Move 3: LEFT → (4,5)
Body becomes [ (5,5), (5,6) ]

From here:

Move 4: DOWN → (4,4)
Check if (4,4) is part of the body. Current body after Move 3 is [ (5,5), (5,6) ], so no collision.

Move 4: DOWN → (4,4)

Move 5: DOWN → (4,3)

Move 6: DOWN → (4,2)
But wait, from (4,3), moving DOWN to (4,2):

Check if any body parts are at (4,2). Current body after Move 6 would be [ (4,3), (4,4) ].

Wait no—each move adds a new head and drops the tail. So let's track step by step:

After Move 1: LEFT to (5,6)
Body: [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Move 2: DOWN to (5,5)
Body becomes [ (5,6), (6,5) ]

Wait no—that doesn't seem right. When moving from (5,6) down to (5,5):

The new head is (5,5). The previous segments were [ (5,6), (6,5) ].

So the body after Move 2 becomes [ (5,6), (5,5) ]? No, that's not how it works. Each move shifts all the segments forward.

Actually, when you move down from (5,6), the segment at (6,5) moves to where the previous head was, which is (5,6). So:

After Move 1: Head at (5,6), body [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Move 2: DOWN → new head at (5,5)

- The segment that was at (6,5) moves to (5,5)'s previous position? Wait no.

Actually, the snake's body follows the path. So after each move, the tail segment is lost unless eating food.

So:

After Move 1: Head at (5,6), body segments [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Wait that doesn't make sense because (6,6) was the original head position. Wait no—when you move from (6,6) to (5,6):

- New head is (5,6)
- The previous head (6,6) becomes the first body segment
- So body is [ (6,6), ... ] ?

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to accept that without a visual, it's hard to track, but logically, as long as each new position doesn't coincide with any existing body segments except the head, it should be safe.

So, based on that, let's try:

1. (6,6) → LEFT to (5,6)
   - Body: [ (6,6), ... ] ?

Wait no—the original body was at (6,5) and (6,6). When moving left from (6,6) to (5,6):

- New head is (5,6)
- The segment that was at (6,6) becomes the first body segment: [ (6,6), ... ]
But originally, there were two segments: (6,5) and (6,6). So moving left adds a new head at (5,6), making the body [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

After Move 1:

Head: (5,6)
Body: [ (6,5), (6,6) ]

Move 2: DOWN from (5,6) to (5,5)

- New head: (5,5)
- Body becomes [ (5,6), (6,5) ]
Wait, because the previous segments were (6,5) and (6,6). When moving down, the segment that was at (6,6) moves up? No.

Actually, when you move DOWN from (5,6):

The new head is (5,5).

The segment that was at (5,6) (which was just moved there in Move 1) becomes part of the body. So the body after Move 2 would be:

[ (5,6), (6,5) ]

Because when you move down, each segment follows the previous head.

So after Move 2:

Head: (5,5)
Body: [ (5,6), (6,5) ]

Check if any of these body segments are at (5,5). No, because (5,6) and (6,5) are different. So safe.

Move 3: LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5)

- New head: (4,5)
- Body becomes [ (5,5), (5,6) ]

Check body segments: (5,5) is the new segment added, and (5,6). Neither is at (4,5). Safe.

Move 4: DOWN from (4,5) to (4,4)

- New head: (4,4)
- Body becomes [ (4,5), (5,5) ]

Check body segments: none are at (4,4). Safe.

Move 5: DOWN from (4,4) to (4,3)

- New head: (4,3)
- Body becomes [ (4,4), (4,5) ]

Safe.

Move 6: DOWN from (4,3) to (4,2)

- New head: (4,2)
- Body becomes [ (4,3), (4,4) ]

Now, we've reached the target position at (4,2).

So, after six moves, the snake has successfully navigated from (6,6) to (4,2) without colliding with its own body.

Therefore, the minimal number of steps required is 6.
</think>

The snake needs to move a total of six steps to reach the target position from its starting point. Each step involves moving either left or down without colliding with its own body segments.

$\boxed{6}$
