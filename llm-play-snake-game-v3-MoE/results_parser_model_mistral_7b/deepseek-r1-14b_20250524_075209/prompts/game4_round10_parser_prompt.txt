<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (1,4) to eat the apple at (9,9). Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the current state. The head is at (1,4), and the body follows as [(2,4), (3,4)]. So the snake is moving in a straight line to the right so far. The direction is "LEFT," which seems a bit confusing because the snake is actually moving right but the last move was left? Wait, no—the current direction is LEFT, meaning it's facing left. But the body is behind it—wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the head is at (1,4), and the body is [(2,4), (3,4)]. So that would mean the snake is moving to the right because each body part follows in order. Wait, no—the direction is LEFT, which means the head is moving left, but the body is behind it? That doesn't make sense because if the head is at (1,4) and the next body part is (2,4), that would mean the snake was moving right before, not left.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: The current direction is LEFT, so the head's next move will be to the left of (1,4), which is (0,4). But the body cells are [(2,4), (3,4)], which suggests that after moving left, those positions would shift.

Wait, no—the body cells are given as the list behind the head. So if the head is at (1,4) and direction is LEFT, the next move will take it to (0,4). The current body parts are [(2,4), (3,4)], so that implies that before moving, the snake was extending to the right. Wait, maybe the initial position is that the snake's head is at (1,4), and then the body follows: the next part is (2,4), then (3,4). So the direction is LEFT now, which would mean the next move is to the left.

But I'm a bit confused about how the body moves. Let me think about movement rules again. When moving, the new head is computed, then the body shifts. Each move updates the body by inserting the old head at the front and possibly removing the tail unless an apple was eaten.

In this case, since the snake's direction is LEFT, moving left would take the head to (0,4). But I need to make sure that after the move, the new head doesn't collide with any body parts except potentially the tail if it's about to move.

Wait, but the current body cells are [(2,4), (3,4)]. So when we move left, the new head is (0,4). Then, the old head (1,4) becomes the first body part. The next step would be:

- New head: (0,4)
- Body becomes [ (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ]
- Since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail (3,4). So the new body is [ (1,4), (2,4) ]

Wait no, because the original body cells are [(2,4), (3,4)]. After moving, the old head (1,4) is inserted at the front of the body list. Then, if not eating an apple, remove the last element.

So the new body after moving left would be [ (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) ]? No, wait: when we move, the body list is updated by inserting the old head at the front and then possibly removing the tail. So:

Original state:
Head: (1,4)
Body: [(2,4), (3,4)]

After moving LEFT to (0,4):
- New head: (0,4)
- Insert old head (1,4) into body list → new body is [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]
- Since we didn't eat an apple, remove the tail (3,4). So the new body is [(1,4), (2,4)]

So the snake's new state would be:
Head: (0,4)
Body: [ (1,4), (2,4) ]

Now, I need to find a path from (0,4) to (9,9). Wait no—wait, wait. The apple is at (9,9), which is the top-right corner.

But initially, the head is at (1,4), and we're moving LEFT first. But if the snake's direction is currently LEFT, can I change it? Because after that move, the new direction will be whatever I choose next, but I have to make sure not to reverse directions.

Wait, movement rules: cannot reverse direction. So current direction is LEFT, so next move cannot be RIGHT. Similarly, if the direction was UP, you can't go DOWN next.

So from LEFT, possible next moves are LEFT (same direction) or UP or DOWN? Or no—wait, the rule says "cannot reverse". So if current direction is LEFT, then next direction can't be RIGHT. It can be any other except RIGHT.

Wait, the rules say: cannot reverse, meaning you can't go back to the opposite direction. So from LEFT, you can't choose RIGHT next move. But you can choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT again? Or wait, maybe you can only choose UP or DOWN as they're perpendicular?

No, I think the rule is that you can't choose the exact opposite direction of the current one. So if current is LEFT, you cannot choose RIGHT next.

So from LEFT, possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT itself (if allowed by grid boundaries and collision rules).

But let's get back to planning the path.

The apple is at (9,9), which is quite far from (1,4). The Manhattan distance is 8 in x direction (from 1 to 9) and 5 in y direction (from 4 to 9). So we need a way to move right 8 times and up 5 times.

But the snake's body will grow as it eats apples. But initially, the snake has length 3: head plus two body segments. Each time it eats an apple, its tail doesn't move, so it grows by one segment.

So first, I need to plan a path that allows the snake to reach (9,9) without colliding with itself or the walls. Also, after eating the apple, there must be at least one legal move left to prevent being trapped.

Let me think about possible paths.

Option 1: Move right as much as possible, then up.

But current direction is LEFT, which is moving towards (0,4), which might not be helpful for getting to (9,9). So perhaps after moving left once, I can turn around and start moving right. But wait, the next move after LEFT can't be RIGHT because that's reversing? Or no—the rule says you cannot reverse on the first move if current direction is NONE, but in this case, current direction is LEFT.

Wait, movement rules: "Cannot reverse: If current direction is 'UP', you may not choose 'DOWN' next; similarly for 'LEFT'↔'RIGHT'. If current direction is 'NONE', any first move is allowed."

So from LEFT, you cannot choose RIGHT. So after moving LEFT once, the next direction can't be RIGHT.

Wait no—if the current direction is LEFT, then on the next move, I can't choose RIGHT. But if I'm at (0,4) and facing LEFT, which would take me to (-1,4), which is out of bounds—so that's a collision and death. So I need to avoid moving left from (0,4). So perhaps after moving once left to (0,4), the next move should be either UP or DOWN.

But let's think: the initial direction is LEFT, so first move must not reverse. Wait no—the initial move can be any except the reverse of current direction. Since current direction is LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT.

So if I'm at (1,4), direction is LEFT. So I can choose to go LEFT again or choose UP or DOWN.

But moving LEFT from (1,4) takes me to (0,4). Then, from there, next moves can't be RIGHT.

Wait, perhaps it's better to not move left initially but find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the first move should be UP or DOWN, but since current direction is LEFT, I have to make sure that my next move isn't RIGHT. So moving UP or DOWN is allowed.

But the head is at (1,4), and direction is LEFT. So if I choose to move UP instead of LEFT, would that be possible? Wait no—because movement is determined by the direction chosen in each step.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding: the "current direction" variable is the last direction the snake moved, but for the next move, you can change it as long as it's not reversing. So from current direction LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT.

So the possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (same direction).

But in this case, moving LEFT from (1,4) would take head to (0,4), which is on the edge but within bounds.

Alternatively, maybe I should change direction to go UP first, then find a path towards the apple.

Wait, let's think about the grid. The snake starts at (1,4). The apple is at (9,9). So moving right and up is necessary.

But the current body is in the way if I try to move directly right.

Wait, initial position: head at (1,4), body [(2,4), (3,4)]. If I decide to change direction from LEFT to RIGHT, that would be reversing? Because current direction is LEFT, so moving RIGHT next would reverse. So that's not allowed.

So after the first move, if I choose to go LEFT, then next moves can't be RIGHT.

Wait, but maybe we need to make a U-turn somehow by moving in other directions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to plan the path as follows:

1. Move from (1,4) LEFT to (0,4), making sure that body doesn't collide.
2. Then move DOWN or UP to navigate around and then head right towards the apple.

But let's think step by step.

Step 1: From (1,4), direction is LEFT. So if I choose to go LEFT, new head is (0,4). The body becomes [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)] before removing tail, so after moving, the body is [(1,4), (2,4)]. Now, check for collision: new head (0,4) shouldn't collide with any body parts except potentially the tail if it's about to move.

But in this case, the body is [(1,4), (2,4)], so no collision. So that's safe.

Step 2: From (0,4), direction can be UP, DOWN, or LEFT. But moving LEFT again would take me out of bounds, so better to choose UP or DOWN.

Let's choose DOWN to move towards y=5.

Move DOWN from (0,4) to (0,5). Now, the body becomes [(0,4), (1,4), (2,4)] before removing tail. Since we didn't eat an apple, remove the last part (2,4), so new body is [(0,4), (1,4)].

Now, head at (0,5), direction DOWN.

Next move: can't go UP because it's reversing. So possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.

But moving LEFT from (0,5) would take to (-1,5)—invalid. Moving RIGHT would take to (1,5). Let's try that.

Move RIGHT to (1,5). Body becomes [(0,5), (0,4), (1,4)] before removing tail (1,4). So new body is [(0,5), (0,4)]. No collision with head at (1,5).

Now, direction is RIGHT.

Next move: can't go LEFT. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.

Move RIGHT to (2,5). Body becomes [(1,5), (0,5), (0,4)] before removing tail (0,4). New body is [(1,5), (0,5)].

Continue moving right towards (9,5). But we need to reach (9,9), so after reaching x=9 at y=5, then move up.

But perhaps it's better to plan a more direct route. Alternatively, let's think about the steps needed:

We need to go from (1,4) to (9,9).

Let me try to plan a path that goes right as much as possible, but considering the snake's body and direction constraints.

Another approach: since the snake is currently extending to the right, perhaps we can make it turn up after moving right enough.

But given that current direction is LEFT, which complicates things. Maybe first move left once to (0,4), then change direction down or up, but considering the available moves without reversing.

Alternatively, maybe the first move should be UP instead of LEFT, but wait—can I choose UP as the next move even though current direction is LEFT?

Yes, because from LEFT, you can't go RIGHT, but UP and DOWN are allowed. So let me try that.

So initial position: head (1,4), body [(2,4), (3,4)], direction LEFT.

Step 1: Choose to move UP instead of LEFT. Is this possible? Wait, no—the movement is determined by the chosen direction each step, regardless of current direction?

Wait no—wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The "current direction" variable determines the direction you are facing, but when making a move, you can choose any direction except the reverse of the current one.

So if current direction is LEFT, next move cannot be RIGHT; it can be LEFT, UP, or DOWN.

Therefore, in step 1, from (1,4), I can choose to move LEFT, UP, or DOWN. So let's try moving UP first.

Move UP: head moves to (1,5). The body becomes [(2,4), (3,4)], so inserting old head (1,4) at front → [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]. Since we didn't eat an apple, remove tail (3,4), new body is [(1,4), (2,4)].

Now, direction is UP.

Step 2: From (1,5), current direction is UP. So next move cannot be DOWN.

Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Let's choose RIGHT to start moving towards the apple.

Move RIGHT to (2,5). Body becomes [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4)] before removing tail (2,4) → new body is [(1,5), (1,4)].

Now, direction is RIGHT.

Step 3: From (2,5), move RIGHT again to (3,5). Body becomes [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4)] before removing tail (1,4) → new body [(2,5), (1,5)].

Direction remains RIGHT.

Continue moving right until x=9:

Step 4: (4,5)
Step 5: (5,5)
Step 6: (6,5)
Step 7: (7,5)
Step 8: (8,5)
Step 9: (9,5)

At this point, the head is at (9,5), body is [(8,5), (7,5), ... ] but let's check the exact body positions.

Wait, each time we move right, the body shifts. So after step 1: moved UP to (1,5), then RIGHT to (2,5), and so on until (9,5).

But wait, how many segments does the snake have? Initially, it was head + two body parts. Each time it eats an apple, it gains a segment.

But in this case, we haven't eaten any apples yet, so the length remains 3.

Wait no—initially, the snake has 3 segments: head at (1,4), then (2,4) and (3,4). When moving UP to (1,5), the body becomes [(1,4), (2,4)], because we inserted the old head and removed the tail. Then when moving RIGHT to (2,5), body becomes [(1,5), (1,4)].

So after several moves right, the snake's body will be:

At x=9, y=5: head at (9,5), previous positions are (8,5) and (7,5). So body is [(8,5), (7,5)].

Now, from (9,5), we need to move up to reach (9,9).

But the current direction is RIGHT. Next move can't be LEFT because it's reversing. So possible directions: RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.

But moving RIGHT from (9,5) would take us to (10,5), which is out of bounds—invalid. So we have to change direction to UP.

Is that allowed? Current direction is RIGHT; next move can't be LEFT. But we're changing to UP, which is allowed.

So step 10: from (9,5), direction is RIGHT, but we choose to move UP instead. Wait no—can we just choose the direction regardless of current facing?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood earlier. The movement isn't constrained by current direction in terms of possible directions; rather, you can't reverse.

So when you're moving in a certain direction, your next move can't be the exact opposite. But you can change to any other direction except the opposite.

Therefore, from direction RIGHT, next move can be UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again (if possible).

So yes, we can choose to move UP from (9,5) to (9,6).

But wait, after moving right to (9,5), the body is [(8,5), (7,5)]. So when moving up:

New head: (9,6)

Body becomes [(9,5), (8,5), (7,5)] before removing tail. Since we didn't eat an apple, remove (7,5). New body: [(9,5), (8,5)]

Now direction is UP.

Next move can't be DOWN. So possible directions: UP, RIGHT, or LEFT.

But from (9,6), moving RIGHT would go to (10,6)—invalid. Moving LEFT would take to (8,6). Let's try that.

Step 11: Move LEFT to (8,6). New head (8,6).

Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5)] before removing tail (8,5). So new body is [(9,6), (9,5)].

Now direction is LEFT.

Next move can't be RIGHT. Possible directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN.

But from (8,6), moving LEFT would take to (7,6).

Let's continue moving LEFT towards lower x values while keeping y at 6 until we reach x=0 or a wall. But that doesn't help us reach the apple at (9,9). Alternatively, perhaps change direction.

Wait, but I need to reach y=9 from y=6. So maybe it's better to keep moving UP after reaching (9,5).

Alternatively, let's backtrack a bit. Maybe there's a more efficient path.

Perhaps instead of going all the way right and then up, we should make a different turn earlier.

Let me try another approach:

After step 9: head at (9,5), body [(8,5), (7,5)], direction RIGHT.

Instead of moving UP immediately, perhaps move DOWN to navigate around, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, since the goal is to reach (9,9), which is directly above (9,5), maybe it's better to keep moving UP from (9,5).

So step 10: Move UP to (9,6), as before. Body becomes [(9,5), (8,5)].

Step 11: Move UP again to (9,7). Body becomes [(9,6), (9,5)].

Step 12: Move UP to (9,8). Body becomes [(9,7), (9,6)].

Step 13: Move UP to (9,9). Now, the head is at the target position. But wait, we need to ensure that when moving to (9,9), the body doesn't collide with itself.

The body before moving would be [(9,8), (9,7)]. So after inserting new head, it's [(9,9), (9,8), (9,7)] and then remove tail (9,7). New body: [(9,9), (9,8)].

No collision with the new head at (9,9).

But wait—before moving to (9,9), we need to check if any part of the body is at (9,9) or will be in the next move. Since after step 13, the body is [(9,8), (9,7)], no conflict.

So yes, this path works.

Now, let's count the steps:

1. Move UP to (1,5)
2. Move RIGHT to (2,5)
3. Move RIGHT to (3,5)
4. Move RIGHT to (4,5)
5. Move RIGHT to (5,5)
6. Move RIGHT to (6,5)
7. Move RIGHT to (7,5)
8. Move RIGHT to (8,5)
9. Move RIGHT to (9,5)
10. Move UP to (9,6)
11. Move UP to (9,7)
12. Move UP to (9,8)
13. Move UP to (9,9)

Total steps: 13 moves.

But perhaps there's a shorter path by making better use of direction changes without reversing.

Alternatively, let me try another strategy:

Step 1: From (1,4), move LEFT to (0,4). Body becomes [(1,4), (2,4)].
Step 2: Move DOWN to (0,5). Body becomes [(0,4), (1,4)].
Step 3: Move RIGHT to (1,5). Body becomes [(0,5), (0,4)].
Step 4: Move RIGHT to (2,5). Body becomes [(1,5), (0,5)].
...
Continue moving right until (9,5).
Then move up as before.

But this seems similar in steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 3, instead of moving right, turn UP earlier.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was better. The key is that each time you change direction, it's important to not reverse, so from LEFT you can go UP or DOWN, etc.

Another thought: Maybe after moving left once and then down, we can make a U-turn by moving up and right without reversing.

But I think the initial plan of 13 steps is acceptable, though perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Alternatively, let's see if we can reach (9,9) in fewer moves by making use of other directions:

Perhaps move LEFT first, then DOWN, then RIGHT, then UP.

Let me try that:

Step 1: Move LEFT to (0,4). Body becomes [(1,4), (2,4)].
Step 2: Move DOWN to (0,5). Body becomes [(0,4), (1,4)].
Step 3: Move RIGHT to (1,5). Body becomes [(0,5), (0,4)].
Step 4: Move RIGHT to (2,5). Body becomes [(1,5), (0,5)].
...
Continue moving right until x=9 at y=5. That's steps 3-8.

Then move UP from (9,5) to (9,6), etc., as before.

But this still takes similar steps.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of moves is fixed due to the grid movement—snake needs to cover horizontal and vertical distance.

The Manhattan distance from (1,4) to (9,9) is |9-1| + |9-4|=8+5=13. So minimal moves would be 13 if possible, but considering the snake's body can't overlap itself, sometimes you need more steps.

But in this case, since we are allowed to move freely except for reversing direction, it might be achievable in 13 steps.

So I think the answer is that the snake can reach (9,9) in 13 moves without overlapping its body.
</think>

The snake starts at position (1,4). To reach (9,9), it will take a series of moves without reversing direction. The minimal number of moves required is 13, following a path that first moves up or left to change directions and then proceeds towards the target.

\boxed{13}
