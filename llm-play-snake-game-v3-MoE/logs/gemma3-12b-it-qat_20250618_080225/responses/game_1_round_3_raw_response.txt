```json
{
"moves": ["DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
"reasoning": "Moving DOWN repeatedly is the safest way to reach the apple, as it avoids any potential collisions with the snake's body and avoids reversing direction. The final position (8,9) fulfills the coordinate offset requirement."
