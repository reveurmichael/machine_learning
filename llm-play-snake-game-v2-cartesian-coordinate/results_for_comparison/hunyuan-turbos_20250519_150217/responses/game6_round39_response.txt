  "moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "DOWN", "DOWN"],
  "reasoning": "The snake needs to move left to decrease the x-coordinate from 9 to 5 and then down to increase the y-coordinate from 1 to 2. The first move cannot reverse the current direction (DOWN), so moving LEFT is safe and aligns with the path to the apple."
