BEGINNING OF RESPONSE_1:

```
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to plan a path for my snake in the Snake game. The snake's head is at (4,5), and the apple is at (4,4). Since both are on the same x-coordinate, the snake needs to move left from its current position.

First, I need to check if the new_head would collide with any body cells except the tail's current cell. Since we're currently in a normal move, after moving, if new_head is not an apple, it should be safe. But if it is, then the snake can grow and continue without removing the tail.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Current Direction**: The snake is facing "DOWN". So the next direction could be "UP", but since it's the first move, I think I have to plan a left movement to avoid immediate collision with the apple.

2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Moving LEFT: Let's calculate where new_head would go.
     Current head is (4,5). Moving left means x decreases by 1. So new_head becomes (3,5).
     Now I need to check if this cell is occupied by any body segments except the tail's current position.

Wait, in the initial state, the snake's head is (4,5), and there are no body segments because the input says 'Body cells' list has [(4,6)]. So the tail is at (4,6). But when moving left to (3,5), that's not occupied by any body segment. 

So, from (4,5) moving left would take it directly to (3,5), which isn't a body cell. That seems safe for now.

3. **Check for Collisions**: After moving LEFT, the new_head is (3,5). Now I need to make sure that in the next step, this position doesn't lead to an immediate trap if the tail moves later. Since we're about to eat the apple, it's okay because after that, we'll grow the body.

4. **Update Body**: After moving LEFT without eating the apple, we remove the tail (which is at (4,6)). So our new body would be [(4,5), (3,5)]? Wait no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, initial state: head is (4,5). The body cells list is just [(4,6)]. So when calculating the new_head after moving LEFT, it's (3,5). Now, we check if this cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail's current position. Since the tail is still at (4,6), and (3,5) isn't a body cell, so no collision.

So, moving to (3,5) is safe because it won't collide with the next move when we eat the apple later. So I can plan to move LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5).

But wait, in the initial state, are there any other body segments besides the tail? No, because the input says only [(4,6)] is given.

Wait a minute, moving to (3,5) would make our new position not adjacent to the current body. Wait no, because each body segment must be adjacent by Manhattan distance 1. So from head (4,5), if I move LEFT to (3,5), that's correct as it's directly left. No other body segments.

But wait, in the initial state, is there any other position? The snake has only one cell so far, with head and no body except the tail which is at (4,6). So when moving to (3,5), we need to ensure that the new_head isn't adjacent to any other body cells.

But since the tail is at (4,6), and our new_head is (3,5), they are not adjacent. The next move will be after eating the apple, so we don't have to worry about collision yet.

So I think moving LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5) is safe for now.

But wait, let's make sure that in the initial state, when the snake moves, does it affect the body? No. The head remains at (4,5), and the body shifts left by one position, with the tail moving out. But since we are not eating the apple yet, only moving to a new position.

So from (4,5) moving LEFT, we land on (3,5). Now, I need to check if this is inside the grid: x ranges 0-9 and y also same. (3,5) is valid. Also, not in the body cells except the tail's current cell? The body after this move would be [(4,6), (3,5)]. Wait no, because the snake is moving, so the new head becomes (3,5). Then the tail is removed from (4,6).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.

Initially:
- S = [ (4,5) ] → No body segments beyond head. Because the input says "Body cells" list has [(4,6)]. So no body except the tail at (4,6). Wait, but in the initial state, the snake is just one segment: the head at (4,5), and then the tail at (4,6).

So when moving LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5):
- The new_head is (3,5).
- We check if this cell is occupied by any body segments except the tail's current position.

The body before moving was just [(4,6)]. After moving, we remove the old head (4,5), and insert it at front. So new_head becomes (3,5). The body now includes [ (3,5) ] plus the remaining body cells? Wait no, the snake's body is all except the tail, so after this move, the body would be [(3,5)], but wait, that can't be right because we have to maintain continuity.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. The snake has a head and some body segments. Each body segment is adjacent to the previous one. So if moving from (4,5) to (3,5), which is left, then the new_head is (3,5). But that's not connected to any other segments except the tail at (4,6). Since (3,5) isn't adjacent to anything else, it's just a single segment now.

Wait no, because after moving, the snake should have all body segments in order. So from (4,5), moving LEFT lands on (3,5). The next position is (2,5), but that would be another move. Wait, but in this case, we're only about to eat the apple at (4,4) now.

So perhaps I can plan a single step from (4,5) to (3,5), then eat the apple in the next step.

Wait no, because eating the apple is part of the same movement. So if I move LEFT and don't eat it yet, that's okay. Then when moving again, if I eat it, the tail will be at (4,6) before this move, so new_head would be (5,4), but wait no.

Wait, in the initial state:

- S = [ (4,5), (4,6) ]
- Head is (4,5)
- Body segments are [(4,6)]

If I move LEFT to (3,5):

- New_head is (3,5)
- Since it's not a body cell except if the tail moves, but since we're not eating yet, no collision.
- So new_head is safe.

So after moving, the snake's new S becomes [ (3,5), (4,6) ] because I added the old head at front and removed the tail. But that doesn't make sense because from the initial state, the body is [(4,6)], so inserting (4,5) before makes it [ (4,5), (4,6) ], but then we remove the tail (which was (4,6)), so S becomes [ (4,5), (3,5) ].

Wait no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you move, the snake moves one cell forward, and the body shifts. So from [(4,5), (4,6)], moving to (3,5), which would replace (4,6). But in reality, it's more accurate to model it as:

new_head = (4 - 1, 5) = (3,5)
old head is removed and added at front: S becomes [ (3,5), (4,6) ]
then, if new_head != apple position, remove tail. But the apple is at (4,4), which isn't (3,5), so we don't remove the tail.

Wait that can't be right because after moving to (3,5), the snake's body should have [ (3,5) ] but with a new head and no body segments except the tail? No, the snake still has two body segments: from (4,5) is gone, and the new_head is added. So the snake would now be [ (3,5), (4,6) ]. Wait that's not correct because it should have only one segment.

I think I'm getting confused with how the movement works. Let me try to model it properly.

When moving, the head moves to a new position. We then check for collisions in the current body before moving again.

So:

Initial state:
- S = [ (4,5) ] → no body segments except the tail?
Wait no, because the input says "Body cells" list is [(4,6)]. So it's just one segment: head at (4,5), and the tail at (4,6).

When I move LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5):

- new_head = (3,5)
- We check if this position is in any body cell except the tail. The body before moving was [(4,6)]. Since (3,5) isn't in body cells except after moving? Wait no.

Wait I'm getting confused. Let me think about how to model the snake's movement step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - Head is at (4,5)
   - Body before move: [(4,6)]
   - S = [ (4,5), (4,6) ] → because each segment has a head and a tail, but perhaps I should model it as just the head since body is implied.

2. **Current Direction**: Down
3. **Possible Moves**:
   - Moving UP: new_head would be (5,5). Let's see if that's inside grid.
   - Moving DOWN: (3,5)
   - Moving LEFT: (4,4)
   - Moving RIGHT: (4,6) → which is the tail; but can't move there.

So moving to (4,4) would be forward. But from current position (4,5), moving LEFT lands on (4-1, 5) = (3,5). So new_head is (3,5).

But then, after moving, we need to check if (3,5) is adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current cell.

The body before this move was [(4,6)]. The head was (4,5), which moved to (3,5). So now, the new_head is (3,5). This position isn't in body cells because body cells are only at (4,6).

So no collision. Now, can I eat the apple?

Yes, because after moving, if I land on (4,4), that's where the apple is.

Wait wait, but the head moved to (3,5). The apple is at (4,4), which isn't in any body cells except the tail. So landing there would be safe before checking collision.

So perhaps I can plan to move LEFT directly to (3,5) and not eat the apple yet, which avoids immediate collision with a future step if I were to eat it later.

Wait but no: if I land on (3,5), that's adjacent to body cell [(4,6)]? No, because Manhattan distance is |3-4| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2. So yes, they are not adjacent. Wait no:

Manhattan distance between (3,5) and (4,6) is |3-4| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2. Not 1. So they aren't adjacent. Therefore, no collision.

So in this case, moving to (3,5) is safe for now. Then I can plan to eat the apple later when I move again from there to (4,4). That way, after eating, the tail moves out, and the body becomes [(4,6), (3,4)], but wait that's not possible because each segment must be adjacent.

Wait no: in reality, after moving to (3,5), you eat the apple at (4,4) only if possible. But from (3,5), can I move to (4,4)?

From (3,5), moving RIGHT is (4,5). That's where I was previously.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just plan to move LEFT to (3,5) and then later when in a normal step, move RIGHT to (4,4) to eat the apple. But since in this problem statement, we are only supposed to make one movement from (4,5), what is allowed?

Wait no: Wait, the question says "you are about to make your first movement". So you have to decide on a single move that leads you toward eating the apple without causing an immediate collision.

But if I just plan to move LEFT directly, landing at (3,5), which isn't adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position. But since I'm not planning to eat it yet, that should be fine.

So perhaps the solution is:

1. Move LEFT from (4,5) → new_head (3,5).
2. Check if this is within grid: yes.
3. Since (3,5) isn't in any body segments except after this move? Wait no: because the current body was [(4,6)], and we're inserting the new head at front.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model each movement step by step:

- **Initial State**:
  - S = [ (4,5), (4,6) ] → but this is actually the head and tail.
  - Or maybe just S = [(4,5)] with the body cells as an implied list.

Wait I'm getting stuck. Let's try a different approach.

Each movement step:

1. The snake moves forward one cell in the direction it's currently facing.

2. Then, we check if new_head is adjacent to any other body segments except the tail's current position.

3. If it is, then that would cause a collision with the next move when we eat the apple later. So, in this case, since I'm not eating yet, I can proceed without checking for immediate collision.

4. Then, if new_head is equal to the apple's position, after moving, I will remove the tail and get the next direction as RIGHT.

Wait no: because step 2 would only check before we plan to eat the apple in future steps.

So in this case:

- **Initial Direction**: Down → heading down.

- After moving from (4,5) to (3,5):

   - new_head is (3,5).
   - Check if it's adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position.
     - Body before move: [(4,6)] → because the initial state's body cells are [(4,6)], which was our head after moving.
     - Wait no: I'm getting confused again.

I think the key here is that in the first step of movement:

- We calculate new_head as (4-1,5) = (3,5).

- Then, we need to check if this new_head is adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position. Since our body before moving was [(4,6)], and after moving, the new_head is (3,5). The old head is at (4,5), which is moved out, so added back as the new_head.

Wait I'm getting stuck on how the snake's structure changes with each move. Perhaps it would help to think in terms of how body cells are updated:

- When moving forward, the current head is removed from the list and inserted at front.
- The tail is shifted out by removing its position (the last element before the move).
- If new_head isn't the apple's cell, then we don't remove the tail.

So in this case:

**Initial State Before Moving**:
- S = [ (4,5) ]
- Body cells: [(4,6)]
- Tail is at (4,6).

Wait no, that can't be right because a snake with only one segment would have head and tail both at the same cell. So perhaps in this problem, the body cells are given as [(x,y)], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each movement just replaces the head with new_head and shifts the rest of the segments forward, except the tail being removed if necessary.

Wait no, perhaps it's better to model the snake's segments after moving:

- The current head (4,5) is removed from its position.
- Inserted at front: [new_head] = [(3,5)] added before any other segments?
- Then, since new_head isn't the apple position, we don't remove the tail.

So body becomes [ (3,5), (4,6) ] → meaning two segments in a line from (3,5) to (4,6).

Wait but that seems to make sense. So after moving LEFT, S is [ (3,5), (4,6) ], meaning the snake's head is at (3,5), and tail is at (4,6). But wait, (3,5) can't be adjacent to any body segments except itself, which seems impossible.

Wait no: (3,5)'s next segment would be (4,6), so they are one step apart. Manhattan distance 1 → adjacent. So that's fine.

But when I plan to move again:

After moving to (3,5), if the apple is at (4,4), can I reach it in a normal move?

From (3,5):

- Moving RIGHT: new_head would be (4,5). Is that in any body segment? Yes, because before this move, the head was (4,5) and tail was (4,6).

Wait no:

When moving from (3,5), to get new_head, I compute as follows:

current_head is (4,5)

new_head = current_head.x ± 1, y → since direction is RIGHT.

So new_head would be (5,5).

But in the initial state, after first move, S was [ (3,5), (4,6) ].

Then, moving from (3,5):

- new_head = (3+1,5) = (4,5)
   - But wait, that's where the head was. So we need to see if this is in any body segments except the tail's current position.
   - The body before moving is [ (3,5), (4,6) ].

So new_head is (4,5). Is it adjacent to any body segment?

- (4,6): distance 1 → Manhattan is 1. So yes, they are adjacent. Therefore, this would be a collision with the next move if we land here and plan to eat the apple later.
   
Therefore, moving to (4,5) directly from (3,5) would cause a collision when planning to eat the apple at (4,4).

Hence, I should instead consider moving LEFT again.

But that's not possible because in the initial move, from (4,5), moving LEFT is (3,5). From there, if I can reach the apple in one step without causing a collision with next move.

Wait but after moving to (3,5) and planning to eat at (4,4):

- new_head would be (4,4).
   - Now check if (4,4) is adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position.
     - Body before this move: [ (3,5), (4,6) ]
     - So, can (4,4) be moved into without causing collision?
       - From (3,5): moving RIGHT would get (4,5).
         - Is (4,5) adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position?
           - Body before this move: [ (3,5), (4,6) ] → so no, because (4,5) isn't in the body.

Therefore, moving RIGHT from (3,5) would land at (4,5). Which is adjacent to (4,6) but not to any other body segments. Wait:

Manhattan distance between (4,5) and (4,6) is 1 → they are adjacent. So that's a collision.

Thus, again, moving to (4,5) would cause a collision when planning to eat the apple at (4,4).

So perhaps I need to find another way.

Wait maybe instead of moving LEFT once, I can move RIGHT once and then LEFT again? But that seems complicated. Alternatively, is there any direction where I can reach (4,4) without causing immediate collision?

No, because from current head position, after first move:

- Moving LEFT gets me to (3,5)
- From here, moving either UP or DOWN would take me away.

Wait perhaps I should consider that the apple is in the same row as the tail's current cell. So if the snake can reach it without causing a collision with the next step, then it's possible.

But according to the problem statement, you are about to make your first movement.

So your move must be towards the apple without being on a collision path.

Looking at this:

- The initial head is (4,5)
- Apple is at (4,4) → same row.
   - So moving LEFT or RIGHT can get me there. But if I move LEFT, I'm at (3,5), which is adjacent to the body's (4,6). Wait no: from (3,5), can I move RIGHT to reach (4,5)?

Wait in that case, the next step would be:

- Moving RIGHT from (3,5) to get new_head = (4,5)
   - Check if this is adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position.
     - Body before this move: [ (3,5), (4,6) ] → so (4,5) is not in body. Thus, no collision.

Therefore, from (3,5), moving RIGHT would get me to (4,5). Then, I can plan to eat the apple at (4,4).

But wait: after moving to (4,5), when I land there, do I check if it's adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position?

No, because in this case, we are about to make the first movement. So after planning that move, we don't yet eat the apple.

Wait no: The problem says "you are about to make your first movement." So you plan one movement without knowing where the apple will be, and then when you land there, if it's the apple, you eat it. But in this case, you have already made a movement, so perhaps moving to (3,5) is safe because you can't predict yet.

But wait, after moving to (3,5), if I plan to move RIGHT to reach (4,5), then from that point, the next move could be:

- Moving LEFT: to (3,4)
   - Check collision with body segments → which includes (4,6) but not this new_head. So no problem.

Therefore, perhaps in my first movement, I can move LEFT to (3,5). Then, upon landing there, the apple is at (4,4), and I can plan to move RIGHT to reach it without causing a collision for the next step. Because from (3,5):

- Moving RIGHT: new_head = (4,5)
   - Check if this is adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position.
     - Body before moving: [ (3,5), (4,6) ]
     - So Manhattan distance between (4,5) and (3,5) is 1 → adjacent.
       Wait no: from (3,5), moving RIGHT gets to (4,5). The next segment is (4,6). So the distance between new_head and body's tail is |4-3| + |5-6|=1+1=2. So not adjacent.

Wait that means moving RIGHT from (3,5) would land me at (4,5), which isn't adjacent to any body segments except for perhaps others, but I think in this case, it's okay because the tail is at (4,6).

So yes, from (3,5), moving RIGHT to reach (4,5) doesn't cause a collision with next step. So that seems acceptable.

Wait wait, let me verify:

When you make your first move:

- Move LEFT from (4,5) → new_head is (3,5)
   - Check if this position is adjacent to any other body segments except the tail's current position.
     - The snake's segments after moving are [ (3,5), (4,6) ].
     - So any body segment besides the tail's current cell? Wait no. Tail's current position is (4,6). From the move, new_head is (3,5), which isn't in any body except for itself?
   - Wait if it's only two segments, (3,5) and (4,6), then new_head at (3,5) isn't adjacent to any other segment. So no collision.

Therefore, moving LEFT from (4,5) is acceptable because after that move, the next move can be RIGHT or something else without immediate collision.

So the conclusion is:

- Make a move LEFT to (3,5).

Thus, I think that's the first and best move.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine how a snake-like structure moves on a grid. The snake starts at position (4, 5) facing down and aims to eat an apple located at (4, 4). The challenge is to plan the first movement in such a way that we avoid any immediate collision with potential future steps if we land on the apple.

### Approach
1. **Current Position**: The snake's head is at position (4, 5) and its tail is at (4, 6).
2. **Direction**: Facing down means moving one step in the negative y-direction each time.
3. **Possible Moves**: From (4, 5), the possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT since DOWN would take us out of bounds.

**LEFT Move**:
- Calculate the new head position: (4 - 1, 5) = (3, 5).
- Check if this new position is adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position.
   - Body segments before moving: [(4, 6)].
   - The distance from (3, 5) to any other segment is more than one step, so no collision.

**RIGHT Move**:
- Calculate the new head position: (4 + 1, 5) = (5, 5).
- Check if this new position is adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position.
   - Body segments before moving: [(4, 6)].
   - The distance from (5, 5) to any other segment is more than one step, so no collision.

Both moves avoid immediate collision for future steps. However, landing on the apple at (4, 4) requires a different approach.

### Solution Code
```python
# Starting position of the snake's head and tail
head = (4, 5)
tail = (4, 6)

direction = 'down'

def move_snake(current_head):
    # Calculate new head position based on current direction
    if direction == 'up':
        return (current_head[0] - 1, current_head[1])
    elif direction == 'down':
        return (current_head[0] + 1, current_head[1])
    elif direction == 'left':
        return (current_head[0], current_head[1] - 1)
    else: # right
        return (current_head[0], current_head[1] + 1)

# Determine possible directions for the first move
possible_moves = []

if direction == 'up':
    new_head = move_snake(head)
    # Check if this is adjacent to any body segments except the tail's current position
    body_segments = [head]
    if not (new_head in body_segments or new_head in (tail)):
        possible_moves.append(new_head)
elif direction == 'down':
    new_head = move_snake(head)
    body_segments = [head]
    if not (new_head in body_segments or new_head in (tail)):
        possible_moves.append(new_head)
elif direction == 'left':
    new_head = move_snake(head)
    body_segments = [(new_head, tail)]
    if not (new_head in body_segments):
        possible_moves.append(new_head)
else: # right
    new_head = move_snake(head)
    body_segments = [(head, new_head)]
    if not (new_head in body_segments):
        possible_moves.append(new_head)

# After first move, check for immediate collision with apple position
apple_position = (4, 4)
if head == apple_position:
    print("You ate the apple at position", apple_position)
else:
    # From new_head, determine if it is adjacent to any body segments except tail's current or previous positions?
    # This part of code was added based on initial problem analysis
    pass
```

### Explanation
- **Head and Tail Tracking**: The snake's head moves according to its direction, and the tail follows.
- **Direction Handling**: Each move is calculated based on the current direction.
- **Collision Avoidance Check**: After each move, we check if landing on a new position would cause a collision with any body segment except the tail. This ensures safety for future steps.

By carefully planning the first move, we can avoid immediate collisions and ensure the snake's movement safely towards eating the apple at (4, 4).
