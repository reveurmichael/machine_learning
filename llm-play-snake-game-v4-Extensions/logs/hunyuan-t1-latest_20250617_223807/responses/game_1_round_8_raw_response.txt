{
"moves": ["RIGHT", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "DOWN", "RIGHT"],
"reasoning": "The snake starts at (3,9) with a vertical body. To reach the apple at (5,2), we first move RIGHT to (4,9) to align horizontally toward the apple. Then, we move DOWN 7 times to reach (4,2), aligning vertically with the apple. Finally, we move RIGHT to (5,2) to eat the apple. This path avoids collisions with the body and ensures a legal move after eating."
