<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get the snake from (7,6) to eat the apple at (6,2). Let's see what the current state is.

First, the head is at (7,6), and it's moving down. The body cells are [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)]. So the snake is going from the head through these points. I need to plan a path where each move doesn't cause collision with the body or walls.

The apple is at (6,2). Looking at the coordinates, the head needs to move left and down. Wait, but the head is already at y=6, and the apple is at y=2, which is lower. So that's a big downward movement needed, but since the snake is moving down currently, maybe I can continue in that direction for a bit.

Wait, no. The current direction is "DOWN," which would take the head to (7,5) next if it continues. But the apple is at (6,2), so perhaps I need to change directions eventually.

Let me think about the body segments. After moving down once, the head moves to (7,5). Then, the body would shift: the old head becomes part of the body, and the tail might move or stay if we eat an apple.

But since the apple is at (6,2), which is quite a bit left and down from the current head position, maybe I need to make some turns. Let's see:

1. Current position: Head at (7,6), direction DOWN.
2. Next possible move: If I continue DOWN, new_head would be (7,5). Is that safe? The body is [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)]. So (7,5) isn't in the body yet. Also, since we're moving down, it's within bounds.

So move 1: DOWN to (7,5).

But wait, after this move, the body will update. The old head (7,6) becomes part of the body, so the new body would be [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)] but wait, no—the body list is given as [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)]. So when we move down, the new head is (7,5). Then, the old head becomes part of the body, so the body list after this move would be [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9) ] but wait no—because we're moving in the same direction as before. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, according to the movement rules:

After computing new_head, if it's safe, then update body positions by inserting old head at front of BODY and possibly removing tail unless apple is eaten.

In this case, since we aren't eating an apple yet, the tail will be removed. So the body after moving down would become [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8)] because the tail was (8,9) and now it's removed. But wait, no—the initial body is [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)]. When we insert old head (7,6) at front, it becomes [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9) ]. But since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail, so body becomes [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8) ].

So the new snake would have head at (7,5), and body segments [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8)].

Wait, no—no, because when we insert old_head into the BODY list. The original body is [BODY1, ..., BODYN], so inserting the old head makes it the new BODY1. Then, if not eating apple, remove last element. So initial body is [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)].

After moving down:

- new_head = (7,5)
- insert old_head (7,6) into front → [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9) ]
- since not eating apple, remove last element (8,9). So body becomes [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8) ].

So the new snake is head at (7,5), body [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8)].

Now, from (7,5), what's next? The apple is at (6,2). So I need to go left and down. But since the current direction is DOWN, which was just moved in that direction. Can't reverse immediately—wait, the rules say you can't reverse direction on the first move after current direction.

Wait, no—the rule says cannot reverse direction. If current direction is "DOWN", next move cannot be "UP". Similarly, LEFT and RIGHT can't be reversed. So from DOWN, I can go LEFT or RIGHT, but not UP.

So from (7,5), possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT, but maybe also others? Wait, no—current direction after the first move is DOWN, so next move cannot reverse to UP. But wait, in this case, after moving down once, the current direction would change to whatever we choose next.

Wait, no—the direction for each move is chosen independently as long as it's not a reversal of the previous direction. So from the initial state, where current direction is "DOWN", I can choose any direction except "UP" on the first move.

So after moving DOWN once, in the next step, the current direction would be whatever we choose next, provided it's not a reverse.

Wait, no—the current direction for each move is what was just used. So if I'm currently moving in DOWN, and then change to LEFT, that's allowed as long as it's not a reversal (but LEFT isn't a reversal of DOWN). Then, the next move can't be RIGHT if previous direction was LEFT.

Hmm, this might complicate things, but perhaps for now, let's plan the path step by step.

From (7,5), I need to get towards (6,2). Let me think about the Manhattan distance. The apple is at x=6, y=2, so from x=7 to 6 is left 1, and from y=5 to 2 is down 3. So total moves needed: left once and down three times.

But I need to plan a path that avoids collisions with the body and walls.

Wait, but after moving down again, where would the head go? Let's see:

Move 2: From (7,5), choose direction LEFT to move to (6,5). Is that safe?

Check if new_head is in any BODY cells except possibly the tail. The current body after first move is [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8)]. So (6,5) isn't in this list. Also, within grid bounds.

So moving LEFT to (6,5). Then, update body:

- Insert old_head (7,5) at front → [ (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8) ]
- Since not eating apple, remove tail (8,8) → body becomes [ (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) ]

So now head is at (6,5), direction is LEFT.

Next move: from (6,5). Need to go further towards the apple. Since current direction is LEFT, next move can't be RIGHT.

The goal is (6,2). So we need to move down 3 more steps. Let's see:

Move 3: From (6,5), choose DOWN to (6,4). Check if safe.

Body after second move is [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)]. Wait no—after moving LEFT and inserting old head, the body was [ (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) ]. So new_head is (6,5). Moving DOWN to (6,4).

Check if (6,4) is in body: the body segments are (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). No. So safe.

After moving down:

- Insert old head (6,5) → [ (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) ]
- Remove tail (7,8) → body becomes [ (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) ]

So head is now at (6,4). Next move: current direction is DOWN.

Move 4: From (6,4), choose DOWN again to (6,3).

Check if safe. Body after previous move is [ (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) ]. New_head (6,3) not in body. So yes.

After moving down:

- Insert old head (6,4) → [ (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) ]
- Remove tail (7,7) → body becomes [ (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) ]

Head at (6,3). Next move: current direction is DOWN.

Move 5: From (6,3), choose DOWN to (6,2). This is the apple's position. So let's see:

- new_head = (6,2)
- Check if in body after previous step: body is [ (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) ]. No.
- Also within grid.

So now, upon moving to (6,2), we eat the apple. So in this case, the body will insert old head (6,3) into front and not remove tail because we ate an apple.

So after move 5:

- new_head = (6,2)
- body becomes [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) ]

Wait no—let me double-check. The initial body before moving to (6,2) is [ (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) ].

When we compute new_head = (6,2):

- Insert old head (6,3) at front → [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) ]
- Since we ate apple, do not remove tail. So body is now [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) ]

So the snake's length has increased by one segment.

Now, after eating the apple, our next move can be any direction except the reverse of current direction. The current direction was DOWN to reach here.

But wait, when we moved from (6,3) to (6,2), that was in direction DOWN. So for the next move, we can't choose UP as it's a reversal. But perhaps that's not an issue because our goal is achieved.

Wait, but I'm trying to plan the moves up to eating the apple. Once eaten, maybe we don't need to go further unless required by the problem.

But according to the question, perhaps only needing to reach the apple once.

So in total, the moves would be:

1. DOWN → (7,5)
2. LEFT → (6,5)
3. DOWN → (6,4)
4. DOWN → (6,3)
5. DOWN → (6,2)

But let's check each step for safety:

Move 1: DOWN to (7,5) is safe.

Body after move 1: [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8) ] – but wait no, initial body was [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)]. After moving down:

- Insert old head (7,6) → [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9) ]
- Remove tail because not eating apple: becomes [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8) ]

So body after move 1 is [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8)].

Move 2: LEFT to (6,5). Check if (6,5) is in the current body. Current body is [ (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8) ]. No. So safe.

After move 2:

- Insert old head (7,5) → [ (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8) ]
- Remove tail because not eating apple: becomes [ (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) ]

Body after move 2: [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)]

Move 3: DOWN to (6,4). Check body: body is [ (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) ]. New_head is (6,4), not in body. Safe.

After move 3:

- Insert old head (6,5) → [ (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) ]
- Remove tail because not eating apple: becomes [ (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) ]

Body after move 3: [(6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)]

Move 4: DOWN to (6,3). Check body: [ (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) ]. New_head is (6,3). Not present. Safe.

After move 4:

- Insert old head (6,4) → [ (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) ]
- Remove tail because not eating apple: becomes [ (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) ]

Body after move 4: [(6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6)]

Move 5: DOWN to (6,2). Check body: not present. Safe.

After eating apple:

- Insert old head (6,3) → [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) ]
- Don't remove tail because we ate the apple. So body remains as is.

So yes, this path works. The moves are DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

Wait, but let's check if any of these moves cause collision with the body after each step.

At move 1: head at (7,5), body [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8)]. So no collision.

Move 2: head at (6,5), body [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)]. No collision.

Move 3: head at (6,4), body [(6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)]. No collision.

Move 4: head at (6,3), body [(6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6)]. No collision.

Move 5: head at (6,2), body [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6)]. No collision.

So this path works. The directions would be:

1. DOWN
2. LEFT
3. DOWN
4. DOWN
5. DOWN

Thus, the sequence of moves is "DOWN", then "LEFT", then three times "DOWN".

But let me see if there's a shorter path or any optimizations.

Alternatively, perhaps after move 2 (head at (6,5)), instead of moving down again, could I make a different turn? But since we're already on the x=6 column and need to get down further, it seems necessary to continue moving down.

Another thing: when I moved from (7,5) to (6,5), that's LEFT. Then from there to (6,4), which is DOWN. Is there a way to make this more efficient? Not really, as we have to go left 1 and down 3.

Alternatively, could I have gone right instead of left after the first move? Let's see:

From (7,5), choosing RIGHT would take head to (8,5). Then from there, need to get back left and down. But that might complicate things because then we'd have to move back left, which might cause collision with the body.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps turning earlier.

Wait, maybe I can change direction after moving down twice.

But no, since after first move, moving down again brings head closer but complicates the path. So perhaps the initial plan is best.

Therefore, the minimal moves are five steps as above.
</think>

The snake needs to navigate from its starting position at (7,6) towards the apple located at (6,2). The optimal path involves moving down twice and then left once, followed by three downward moves to reach the apple. Each move must avoid collisions with the body segments.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Position:** Head at (7,6), Body at [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)].
2. **Move 1:** Move DOWN to (7,5). Safe as it doesn't collide with the body.
3. **Move 2:** Move LEFT to (6,5). Safe as it's not in the updated body segments.
4. **Move 3:** Move DOWN to (6,4). Safe; new_head not in body.
5. **Move 4:** Move DOWN to (6,3). Safe; no collision with current body.
6. **Move 5:** Move DOWN to (6,2) where the apple is located.

Each move ensures the snake's head doesn't collide with its body and stays within grid bounds. After eating the apple, the snake's length increases without removing the tail.

**Answer:**

The snake should make the following sequence of moves:  
\boxed{\text{DOWN}, \text{LEFT}, \text{DOWN}, \text{DOWN}, \text{DOWN}}
```

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR ANSWER:
{
  "moves": ["MOVE1", "MOVE2", ...],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}


## COORDINATE SYSTEM TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSE_1:
- UP = y + 1
- DOWN = y - 1
- RIGHT = x + 1
- LEFT = x - 1

Example Moves from (1,1):
  • UP → (1,2)
  • DOWN → (1,0)
  • RIGHT → (2,1)
  • LEFT → (0,1)

## THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF RESPONSE_1 SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER RESPONSE_1:

The main objective of RESPONSE_1 is to generate a list of moves that leads the snake, whose head is now at (7, 6) and whose body cells are in list format [(8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)], to eat the apple at (6, 2).

## RULES:
- "moves" must be a list of directions from: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"
- "reasoning" must be a brief explanation for the chosen path
- If after reading RESPONSE_1, according to your understanding, no valid path exists or can't be determined, or if you are not sure about the text's meaning of path planning, use: { "moves": [], "reasoning": "NO_PATH_FOUND" } or { "moves": [], "reasoning": "I_CANNOT_UNDERSTAND_THE_TEXT" }

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- First, if RESPONSE_1 starts with the word "ERROR" (capitalized), you should return { "moves": [], "reasoning": "ERROR" }.
- Second, if RESPONSE_1 contains the <think>...</think> tags, you should ignore THINK_PROCESS_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 and rely solely on FINAL_OUTPUT_TEXT_OF_RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format.
- Third, if RESPONSE_1 does not contain the <think>...</think> tags, you should use use the whole text of RESPONSE_1 to figure out your answer in JSON format. Texts at the beginning of RESPONSE_1 are much less important than the texts torwards the end.

Return ONLY the JSON object without any additional text.
