Okay, I need to figure out a safe path for the snake to reach the apple at (7,0) from its current position. The head is at (3,4), and the direction is currently "DOWN". Let me start by understanding the current state.

The body of the snake is [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. So, it's a four-segment snake with the head at (3,4) and the tail at (5,6). The apple is at (7,0). 

First, I should consider the possible directions the snake can move. The current direction is "DOWN", but the next move cannot reverse direction on the first turn if it's currently "NONE". Wait, no—the initial direction is "DOWN", so the next move can't be "UP" because that would be reversing. So, possible directions are "DOWN", "LEFT", or "RIGHT".

If I choose "DOWN", the head will move from (3,4) to (3,3). But looking at the body segments, the tail is at (5,6), which is far away. However, moving down might take the snake closer to the bottom of the grid, but I need to check for collisions.

Wait, when moving "DOWN", the new head is (3,3). The next step would be to check if this position collides with any body segments. The current body includes (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), and (5,6), so none of these are at (3,3). Also, it's within grid bounds. So that seems safe.

If I move "DOWN" first, the new head is (3,3), and the body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. Then, the next direction could be "RIGHT", but I need to see if that's possible without reversing.

Alternatively, moving "RIGHT" initially would take the head to (4,4). From there, the snake can continue moving right or down. Let me explore both options.

Option 1: First move is "DOWN" to (3,3).
From here, the next move could be "RIGHT" to (4,3). Then, the snake would extend further right and try to reach (7,0).

But I need to ensure that after each move, the body segments are properly updated and that no collisions occur.

Another option is to plan a path that goes down and then right. Let's see:

1. Move "DOWN" from (3,4) to (3,3). Now, the snake's body is [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].
2. Next move "RIGHT" to (4,3).
   - Check if this is safe: new head (4,3) isn't in the body except for the tail at (5,6), so it's okay.
   - Now, the snake extends, and the tail moves as well. The body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)] after adding the new head, but wait, no—when moving normally (not eating apple), we remove the tail.

Wait, correction: When you move normally, you insert the old head into the body and then remove the tail. So, after moving "DOWN" to (3,3):

BODY becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].
Then, if I move "RIGHT", new_head is (4,3).

Check collisions: Is (4,3) in the current body? The body is [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. No, so safe.

Update body: insert old head (3,4) at front ⇒ [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].
Then remove the tail (5,6). So new BODY is [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)].

Now the snake's head is at (4,3), and the body follows. Next move could be "RIGHT" again to (5,3).

Continue this way: each time moving right or down towards the apple.

But I need to ensure that eventually, the snake can reach (7,0). The apple is at (7,0), which is far to the right and near the bottom. So, the snake needs to move right as much as possible.

Alternatively, after moving down initially, maybe it's better to go all the way down first before moving right to avoid being blocked by other body segments.

Wait, let me think about the initial direction again. Since the current direction is "DOWN", I can't reverse to "UP" on the first move. So, the next moves must be either continuing down or turning right or left without reversing.

Another approach: perhaps moving right first, then down, to position the snake closer to the apple.

Wait, but if I choose to go right first from (3,4) to (4,4), is that allowed? Since the initial direction is "DOWN", going right would not reverse. So yes, it's allowed.

So, let's try moving right:

1. First move: "RIGHT" to (4,4). Check if safe: new head is within grid and not in body. Body is [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)], so (4,4) is safe.
2. Update body: insert old head (3,4) ⇒ body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. Then remove tail (5,6) ⇒ new body is [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)].
3. Next move: perhaps "DOWN" to (4,3). Check if safe: not in body. Update body accordingly.

From there, the snake can continue moving right and down towards the apple.

But I need to make sure that the path doesn't get blocked by the body segments and that each move keeps the body connected.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to go as far right as possible quickly before trying to go down towards (7,0).

Let me outline a possible path:

- Move "RIGHT" to (4,4).
- Then "RIGHT" again to (5,4).
- Then "DOWN" multiple times to reach y=0.

Wait, the apple is at (7,0), which is far right and near bottom. So from (5,4), moving down would take time, but perhaps it's manageable.

But each time I move, I have to check for collisions with body segments and ensure that the tail can move accordingly.

Another consideration: after eating the apple, the snake must be able to make at least one more move. So, if the snake is in a position where all possible moves are blocked, it's not safe.

But given the grid size, as long as the snake isn't completely surrounded by its own body, it should have some path.

Now, considering the Manhattan distance: from (3,4) to (7,0), the required right moves are 4 and down moves are 4. So a total of 8 moves. But since each move can only be in one direction, perhaps a more optimal path would involve moving right as much as possible first.

Alternatively, considering that the snake's body may block certain paths, it might need to maneuver around itself.

Wait, let me visualize the grid:

- The head is at (3,4).
- Body segments are at (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6).

So, the snake is positioned along x=3 and x=4 in the upper part of the grid. To reach (7,0), the snake needs to move right and down.

If I start by moving "RIGHT" to (4,4), then again "RIGHT" to (5,4). Then maybe "RIGHT" again to (6,4), then "DOWN" to (6,3), etc., until reaching (7,0).

But each time the snake moves right or down, it has to avoid colliding with its body.

Alternatively, moving "DOWN" first could allow the snake to have more space to move right without being blocked by the current body segments above.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to make the snake extend as much as possible towards the apple before turning down.

But let's try to plan step-by-step:

1. Move "RIGHT" from (3,4) to (4,4). Body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].
2. Then move "RIGHT" to (5,4). Now, check if this is safe: new head (5,4). The body segments are at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So (5,4) isn't occupied. Safe.
   - Update body: insert old head (4,4) ⇒ [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. Then remove tail (5,6). So new body is [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)].
3. Next move: perhaps "DOWN" to (5,3).
   - Check if (5,3) is safe: not in body. Safe.
   - Update body: insert old head (5,4) ⇒ [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]. Remove tail (4,6). New body is [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)].
4. Continue moving down to (5,2).
   - Check: safe. Update body accordingly.

This seems like a possible path, but it's time-consuming and may not be the most efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more efficient path:

1. Move "DOWN" from (3,4) to (3,3). Body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].
2. Then move "RIGHT" multiple times: to (4,3), then (5,3), etc., while also moving down.

This way, the snake is moving right and down in a balanced manner towards the apple.

But I need to ensure that after each move, the body segments don't block further progress.

Another consideration: when moving "DOWN", the snake can extend further down without the upper body interfering as much.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal path is:

- Move "RIGHT" twice to reach (5,4).
- Then move "DOWN" four times to reach (5,0), then right twice more to (7,0).

But each time, I have to check if these moves are possible without collisions.

Wait, let's try this detailed step-by-step:

1. Initial position: head at (3,4); body segments [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)].
2. Move "RIGHT" to (4,4). Check: safe. Body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. Remove tail (5,6): new body is [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)].
3. Move "RIGHT" again to (5,4). Check: safe. Body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,4)]. Then remove tail (4,6): new body is [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (5,4)].
   - Wait, no. When moving right from (4,4) to (5,4), the old head was (4,4). So inserting into body: [ (4,4), ... ], but let's correct this:

After first move "RIGHT":
- Body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)].

Then moving "RIGHT" again from (4,4) to (5,4):
- Insert old head (4,4) at front ⇒ body is [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)].
- Then remove tail (4,6): new body is [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)].

So after two "RIGHT" moves, the snake's head is at (5,4), and the body follows.

Now, from here, move "DOWN":

1. Move "DOWN" to (5,3). Check: safe. Body becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)] after inserting old head (5,4).
   - Then remove tail (3,6): new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)].
2. Move "DOWN" again to (5,2). Check: safe. Update body accordingly.
3. Continue moving down until y=0.

From (5,0), the snake needs to move right twice more to reach (7,0).

But each time it moves right, the new head must not collide with any body segments.

So:

1. From (5,0), move "RIGHT" to (6,0). Check: safe.
   - Update body: insert old head (5,0) ⇒ [(5,0), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)].
   - Remove tail (3,5): new body is [(5,0), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)].
2. Then move "RIGHT" again to (7,0). Check: safe.

So this seems feasible.

But let's count the moves:

- Initial position: 4 segments.
- After two "RIGHT": 5 segments.
- Each "DOWN" reduces the tail by one segment as it moves normally.

Wait, no. When moving down, each move doesn't necessarily reduce the number of body segments unless we're not eating the apple.

But in this case, when moving towards the apple, we can assume that after each move, the snake will have to adjust its body accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to simulate each possible step and ensure safety.

But given time constraints, I'll outline the plan:

1. Move "RIGHT" twice to (5,4).
2. Move "DOWN" four times to (5,0).
3. Then move "RIGHT" twice to (7,0).

Each of these moves needs to be checked for collisions with body segments.

But let's see if any steps could cause issues:

When moving from (5,4) down to (5,0), we need to ensure that the snake's body doesn't block its own path. Since the body is at [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)], which are above y=4, moving down won't interfere with them.

Similarly, when moving from (5,0) right to (7,0), since the body is above and not blocking the lower part of the grid, it should be safe.

Thus, this seems like a viable path:

- "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"×4, "RIGHT"×2.

But translating that into move order:

1. Move "RIGHT" to (4,4).
2. Move "RIGHT" to (5,4).
3. Move "DOWN" to (5,3).
4. Move "DOWN" to (5,2).
5. Move "DOWN" to (5,1).
6. Move "DOWN" to (5,0).
7. Move "RIGHT" to (6,0).
8. Move "RIGHT" to (7,0).

But each of these moves needs to be verified for safety at the time.

Alternatively, since I can't list every single move here, I need to ensure that in general, this path doesn't lead to collisions and allows the snake to reach the apple without getting stuck.

Another consideration: after moving right twice, the head is at (5,4), and the body segments are [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]. So when moving down, each subsequent move will have the head lower while the tail remains above. Thus, no collision.

When finally moving to (7,0), the snake is at x=5, then moves right twice more. Since the body is above y=0, this should be safe.

So, based on this reasoning, I can outline a possible sequence of moves:

1. "RIGHT"
2. "RIGHT"
3. "DOWN" four times
4. "RIGHT" twice

This would allow the snake to reach (7,0) safely without reversing direction on the first move and while avoiding collisions with its own body.

Therefore, the step-by-step plan is as follows:

- Move right from (3,4) to (4,4).
- Then move right again to (5,4).
- Then move down four times to reach (5,0).
- Finally, move right twice to reach (7,0).

Each of these moves should be safe and avoid collisions with the snake's own body segments.
</think>

To reach the apple at (7,0) safely without reversing direction on the first move, follow this step-by-step plan:

1. **Move Right**: From (3,4), move right to (4,4). This is allowed as it doesn't reverse the initial downward direction. Check that (4,4) is not in your body segments.
2. **Move Right Again**: From (4,4), move right to (5,4). Ensure this position is safe.
3. **Move Down**: From (5,4), move down four times:
   - To (5,3)
   - To (5,2)
   - To (5,1)
   - To (5,0)
4. **Move Right Twice**: From (5,0), move right twice to reach the apple at (7,0).

Each of these moves avoids collisions with your body and adheres to movement rules without reversing direction on the first turn.

**Final Answer:**

Move right twice to position your head at (5,4), then move down four times to (5,0), and finally move right twice to reach the apple. The sequence is:

1. Move right.
2. Move right again.
3. Move down four times.
4. Move right twice.

Thus, the snake successfully reaches the apple at (7,0).

\boxed{(7, 0)}
