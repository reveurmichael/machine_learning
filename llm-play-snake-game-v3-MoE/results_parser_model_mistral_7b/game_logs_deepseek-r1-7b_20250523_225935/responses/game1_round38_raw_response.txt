========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake reach the apple safely. The head is at (7,2), and the apple is way over at (9,8). That's a distance of 2 squares to the right and 6 up. So, it seems like moving right more than once will be necessary.

First, I need to check if there are any immediate threats or blockages. The snake's body is given as [(7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]. Hmm, so the tail is at (4,4). Let me map this out.

The head is at (7,2). When it moves right to (8,2), that's not part of the body yet. But wait, after moving right once, the new head would be at (8,2). Then the body shifts: the old head goes to position 1, so the body becomes [(8,2), (7,3), (7,4), ...]. But hold on, is this safe?

But actually, according to the movement rules, after each move, if the snake eats the apple, it grows and doesn't lose its tail. Otherwise, it loses its tail. So, in my first move, I should check whether moving right would cause any collision.

Wait, the current body includes (7,3), which is adjacent to the new head position (8,2). Let me visualize this grid:

Head at (7,2) → Right move goes to (8,2).

Then the body shifts: the old head (7,2) becomes the new first segment. But wait, the current body after shifting would be [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), ...]. So does that mean that moving right into (8,2) is safe? Because it's not occupied by any body segments except when shifted.

But actually, according to rule 2 in movement updates: if new_head coincides with any BODYi except the tail's current cell when that tail will move this turn. Wait, so after the shift, if I'm moving into (8,2), which is now part of the body behind the old head, but since it's not the tail, which is at (4,4) before movement.

Wait no, let me think again. The snake's current body is [ (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ] behind the head. So when I move right to (8,2), that becomes the new head. Then the old head position (7,2) moves into the second segment, making the body [ (7,3), (7,4), ... ]. Wait no: according to rule 1a, insert the old head at the front of the body list.

So initial S is [ HEAD (7,2), followed by BODY1 (7,3), etc. After moving right:

new_head = (8,2).

Then body shifts:
- Insert old head (7,2) as new BODY1.
- Remove tail if not eating apple.

In this case, since it's a normal move (not eating the apple at first), we remove the last element of the body list. So the body becomes [ (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ] after adding (8,2).

Wait no: when moving right and not eating the apple, we insert the old head into the front and then remove the tail.

So initial S is HEAD (7,2); body is [ (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ].

After moving right:

new_head = (8,2).

Insert (7,2) at front: new body list becomes [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)].

Then remove last element since no apple eaten. So the new body is [ (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4) ].

Wait that doesn't make sense because after inserting, the tail was at (4,4). Removing it would leave [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4)], which is 5 elements. But before movement, there were 6 segments including head: [7,2], and 5 body segments.

Wait maybe I need to clarify:

The initial snake length is len(body) +1 = 6? Because the given body list has 5 elements. So after inserting old head, it's now 6+1=7? No, wait no, let me check again: according to rule 2a in movement update, insert old head at front of the BODY list (becomes BODY1). Then if not eating apple, remove tail.

So initial S is [HEAD, BODY1, ..., BODY5]. When moving right:

new_head = (8,2).

Insert HEAD into position 1: new body becomes [HEAD_new, BODY1_old, ..., BODY5_old].

Then, since not eating the apple, remove last element: so after removal, the snake's segments are [HEAD_new, BODY1, ..., BODY4]. But wait, in this case:

Wait, initial body is [ (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ].

After inserting new_head=(8,2) at front: the new body before removal would be [(8,2), 7,3, 7,4, 6,4, 5,4, 4,4]. Then remove last element to get length same as before. So snake is now [ (8,2), 7,3, 7,4, 6,4, 5,4 ].

But I need to make sure that moving right into (8,2) doesn't collide with any body segments except the tail's current position when it moves this turn. Wait no: after inserting new_head and shifting, but since we are removing the last element, so in the next step, will the tail have moved?

Wait maybe I should think about collision before updating.

In movement rules:

1. Compute new_head.
2. Check for collisions using current state (before any body shifts). So if new_head is already occupied by a BODYi except the current tail's position (since the tail hasn't moved yet), then it collides and dies.

Wait no, rule 2 says: collide with any BODYi except the tail when that tail will move this turn. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Actually, in step 2a, after moving, if you're not eating apple, you remove the tail. So during collision check before body shift:

The snake's new_head is (8,2). Is it present in any of the current body segments? The current body segments are (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4). None of these are (8,2), so that seems safe.

Wait but after moving right to (8,2), which is not in the existing body. So it's okay.

So moving right once is possible without collision.

But wait, when you move into (8,2), and then insert the old head at front, making it the new first segment, followed by current segments: [7,3], etc., but since we are removing the last element because no apple eaten, does that affect anything?

Wait after moving right:

new_head is 8,2.

Insert old head (7,2) into position 1 of the body list. So new body before removal is [7,2; 7,3; 7,4; 6,4;5,4;4,4]. Then remove last element because no apple eaten, so now the body is [7,2;7,3;7,4;6,4;5,4].

Wait but then, after moving right to (8,2), which becomes the new head, and the next segments are 7,3 etc., but the last element in the body before removal was 4,4. So after removing it, the snake's length is now back to 6.

But I think this movement is possible without collision. So moving right once is okay.

So first move: RIGHT

Now head at (8,2). Body becomes [7,3;7,4;6,4;5,4].

Wait no, actually the body after shifting would be:

After inserting new_head into the front and then removing last element if not eating apple. So initial S is [(7,2), 7,3, ..., 4,4]. After moving right: insert (8,2) at front → [ (8,2), (7,2), 7,3; ... ;4,4 ]. Then remove last element because no apple eaten: so body becomes [ (8,2), (7,2), 7,3, 7,4,6,4 ].

But wait that can't be right. Because the initial body was 5 segments behind head, making total snake length of 6. After moving right and inserting new_head, it's 6+1=7? No, rule says to insert at front (so new length is len(body)+1) but then remove tail if not eating apple.

Wait no: the initial S has len(body) +1 =5+1=6 segments. After moving:

Insert new head → body becomes [new_head] followed by current body: so 6 elements now? Wait I'm getting confused here.

Let me try another approach. The snake's length is fixed unless it eats apple or grows. Since we're not eating yet, the length remains same as initial (5+1=6).

Wait no:

In rule 2a and b:

If you eat the apple: your body becomes [new_head] + current body.

If you don't eat: new_body = [new_head] followed by current body except last segment is removed.

Yes, so snake length remains same unless growing (eating apple) or shrinking (losing tail). So when moving right and not eating:

new_head is inserted at front → new_body has len(body)+1 elements. Then we remove the last element because no apple eaten. So net effect: body shifts forward by one.

So in this case, initial S was [7,2; 7,3; ... ;4,4], length=6.

After moving right:

new_head is (8,2).

Insert at front → new_body becomes [(8,2);7,2;7,3;...;5,4;4,4]. Now this body has 7 elements? Or does it just add to the list?

Wait no: when you insert new_head into position 1 of the current body (which is length=6), so after insertion, len(body) becomes 7. Then since no apple eaten, we remove last element → back to 6.

So effectively, the snake moves forward by one segment in direction of movement.

Therefore, moving right once would cause the new head to be at (8,2). Now I need to check if this causes any collision with body segments before updating. According to rule 2: only collide if new_head is on a body segment except for current tail's position when it moves.

But in our case, we're not eating apple yet, so the tail will be at (5,4) after moving right once? Wait no:

Wait let me retrace:

Current head: (7,2), body behind: [7,3; 7,4;6,4;5,4;4,4].

After inserting new_head=(8,2) into front → before removing tail, the snake is [(8,2);7,2;7,3;... ;5,4;4,4]. Then since no apple eaten, remove last element (4,4). So the body becomes [(8,2);7,2;7,3;7,4;6,4].

So in this movement:

- The new head is at (8,2).

- Body shifts: previous head moves to second position.

But now, I need to check if any of these segments after moving would cause collision. So looking for:

Is the new_head present in current body? No, because 7,3 etc., are not 8,2.

So movement is safe.

Therefore, first move: RIGHT

Now head at (8,2). Body is [7,2;7,3;7,4;6,4].

Wait that doesn't seem right. Wait the body after moving should be [(8,2);7,2;7,3;7,4;6,4]. But in this case, the snake's segments are (8,2), then 7,2, etc.

But wait when you remove last element, which was at position 5 (5,4) before removal. So after removing it, body is [ (8,2);7,2;7,3;7,4;6,4 ].

So now the new head is (8,2), and tail is at (6,4).

Hmm, okay. Now let's see if moving right again would be possible without collision.

Moving to (9,2). Check if that position is in current body segments [7,2;7,3;7,4;6,4]. No, so seems safe.

Insert new_head=(9,2) into front: new_body becomes [(9,2);8,2;7,2;7,3;7,4;6,4].

Since no apple eaten yet, remove last element (6,4). So body is [ (9,2);8,2;7,2;7,3;7,4 ].

Wait but now the head is at 9,2 and tail is at 7,4. Now I need to see if moving further right would be possible each time without colliding with the current body segments before updating.

But wait after a few more Right moves, will the snake hit itself?

Alternatively, maybe turning down to move in another direction might prevent future collisions.

Wait let's think ahead: from (7,2), we moved right once to (8,2). Then again to (9,2). Let's see if moving further is possible or not.

At position (10,2):

Is it occupied by any body segments? Current body after two moves: [ (9,2);8,2;7,2;7,3;7,4 ].

No, so seems safe. Insert new_head=(10,2) → body becomes [(10,2);9,2;8,2;7,2;7,3;7,4]. Then remove last element (7,4). So now the snake is [ (10,2);9,2;8,2;7,2;7,3 ].

Wait no: because when moving right again:

Insert (10,2) at front → body is [(10,2), 9,2,8,2,7,2,7,3,7,4].

Then remove last element (7,4): so new body is [ (10,2);9,2;8,2;7,2;7,3 ].

So now head at (10,2), tail at 7,3. Now moving further right to (11,2) would be beyond the grid since maximum x=10 in a 10x10 grid? Wait no: coordinates are from 0 to9, I think.

Wait is it 1-based or 0-based? Probably 0-based because programming often uses that. So max coordinate is (9,9). So moving right beyond (9,2) would be impossible.

So at position (9,2), trying to move right again to (10,2) which may still be possible if the grid allows it. Wait, wait: initial grid is 10x10, so coordinates can go from 0-9 in x and y. So moving right once more would take us to (10,2), but that's outside.

Wait no, actually, in a standard grid setup for such problems, each cell is identified by its row and column numbers starting at 0 or 1? Hmm, probably here it starts from (0,0) up to (9,9). So moving right beyond (9,y) would be impossible. Wait but our initial head was at (7,2), so moving right step by step until (9,2).

Wait let's check:

After first move: Right → 8,2.

Second move: Right→9,2.

Third move: Right→10,2 is beyond grid? So no, can't do that. Therefore, after reaching (9,2), moving right further would be impossible due to grid boundary.

But before moving again, need to check for collision and movement possibility.

Wait at position (7,3): the current body segments are [8,2;7,2;7,3]. Wait no: after two moves:

After first move: head at 8,2. Body was [7,2;7,3;7,4].

After second move: head at9,2. Body is now[8,2;7,2;7,3;7,4].

Wait I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, maybe moving right for three steps to reach (10,2) isn't possible because of grid boundaries.

Thus, the snake can only move right up to x=9. Let's see:

From (7,2), moving right once: 8,2; then 9,2; but next would be beyond grid. So how many moves? Maybe it's better to turn the direction after reaching x=10.

But wait in my previous step-by-step movement, at each step I had to check collision before moving, which seems okay because none of these positions are occupied by current body segments.

Alternatively, maybe turning up or down could help avoid future collisions.

Wait another approach: instead of going all the way right, perhaps making a U-turn once certain conditions allow it.

But first, need to make sure about movement without collision and plan ahead for possible turns.

Wait but if we keep moving right until x=9,y=2, then head would be at (9,2), tail at ... ?

Let me see:

After two moves: head is at 9,2; body is [8,2;7,2;7,3;7,4].

Now trying to move right again would go beyond grid. So it's not possible.

Alternatively, moving back in another direction might be better. For example, after reaching (9,2), turn up or down and see if that path is clear.

But the body may occupy certain cells above head, so care needs to be taken about where the snake can move next.

Wait perhaps a better approach: use BFS or some kind of algorithm to find the shortest path from initial position to apple at (4,3). But maybe it's too time-consuming for me here.

Alternatively, since I need only to plan a sequence of moves that leads to eating the apple without colliding with itself and ensuring each step is valid.

Looking back: Starting position:

Head at 7,2. Body in line from bottom up: (5,4); then (6,4);(7,3);(7,4). Wait no: initial body was [7,3;7,4]? Or did I get it wrong?

Wait the original problem statement says "the body as 1 row which is from x=0 to x=k in vertical direction."

Hmm perhaps my interpretation is incorrect. The user wrote:

"you are given a grid with k rows (x-axis) and m columns (y-axis), so each position is represented by coordinates (x,y)."

Wait I think the initial description may be getting confused between axes.

Wait the problem says:

"You are given a grid with k rows (x-axis) and m columns (y-axis), so each position is represented by coordinates (x, y)."

So x varies along rows from 0 to k-1. Y varies along columns from 0 to m-1?

But then it's unclear about the direction.

Wait wait no: "you are given a grid with k rows (x-axis) and m columns (y-axis)", so each position is at (x,y).

So row x ranges from 0 to k-1, column y ranges from 0 to m-1.

But in terms of movement, right would be increasing y? Or is it the other way?

Wait no: usually in grids, moving "right" increases the x-coordinate if rows are horizontal. Wait but here, since each position is (x,y), probably:

Moving up/down changes x and left/right changes y.

Wait I'm getting confused again because of different grid interpretations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that right moves increase y, so from 2 increasing y would take us upwards in the grid. While moving down increases x.

But this is something important as it affects how we plan movement.

Wait but original problem statement doesn't specify direction for axes, which makes it ambiguous.

Wait maybe I need to make an assumption here because otherwise, my planning won't align with others.

Given that the apple is at (4,3), and initial head position is 7,2. So if right moves increase y, moving from 2 upwards would be towards higher y's. But then apple is lower in y-coordinate than current head?

Wait no: 4 <7? No, 4<7. Wait maybe I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps movement is such that up increases x and right increases y.

But without clear information on how axes are oriented, it's difficult.

Given the initial problem statement:

"you are given a grid with k rows (x-axis) and m columns (y-axis), so each position is represented by coordinates (x,y)."

So probably moving along x corresponds to vertical direction. So higher x would be upwards? Or no: perhaps in this context, increasing x means going down the row.

Wait that's ambiguous as well.

But maybe we can just consider it abstractly without being tied to specific grid directions because movement is relative and only about avoiding collision with own body or apple.

Alternatively, since each move direction (left/right/up/down) must be consistent in planning, perhaps I need to proceed by making assumptions about the coordinate system.

Given that initial position is (7,2), moving right would increase y. But if we can't see whether it's possible without more information, maybe a better approach is required.

Wait given all this confusion, maybe I'm overcomplicating things because perhaps the original problem didn't specify grid direction; instead, it just provides initial and target positions.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on relative movement would help. Because in any case, moving towards apple while avoiding collision with body segments makes sense.

So let's assume that each move is one cell step either up, down, left, or right without collision.

Given the apple is at (4,3), so from initial position (7,2) to target (4,3):

The straight line would involve moving towards decreasing x and increasing y. So perhaps first move up once: reducing x by 1 each time until reach column near apple's x, then adjust direction.

Alternatively, let me calculate the difference:

From head at (7,2), apple is at (4,3). So delta_x = -3, delta_y=+1.

So to reach in straight line, need to move up 3 times and right once? But that might not be possible due to grid or body obstacles.

Alternatively, moving towards it step by step:

First, check if apple is reachable through any path without colliding with own body segments when moving each direction stepwise.

But given the initial position of (7,2), first move could be up. Let me see: moving from 7,2 to6,2. Now need to ensure that this new head at6,2 doesn't collide with current body segments before updating.

Current body after initial steps is [5,4;6,4;7,3;7,4]. Wait no:

Wait original initial position has body as row k-1=0? Or perhaps the body's x coordinates are in rows below the head. So if moving up (reducing x), it would be towards lower rows.

But without knowing exact grid orientation, this is difficult.

Alternatively, maybe I can ignore grid axes and think of movement vectors.

Given that, from (7,2) to (4,3):

Need to move left 3 times (if right increases y) or right 3 times if left decreases x. Wait, perhaps the original coordinate system uses up as decreasing x? Or is it increasing?

Wait given that in initial problem statement, body segments are presented as "from x=0 to x=k" which probably means x-axis runs from top-left (x=0) to bottom-right (x=k). So moving right would increase x.

Similarly, y increases downwards.

So if head is at7,2: meaning row 7, column2. Apple is at4,3: row4, col3.

Wait then movement from higher x to lower x. Therefore, to reach apple, need to move left (from7 down tox=4).

But how? Let me think:

If we can only turn around when possible, perhaps we can plan a path that goes around the current body or through empty spaces.

Given that the initial body is at positions [5,4;6,4;7,3;7,4], let's visualize this:

At (x=5,y=4), then (6,4), (7,3), and (7,4). So these are four points in a sort of L-shape.

So from head at(7,2):

First, moving left to x=6, y=2. Is that position occupied?

Current body segments before movement:

Looking back: current body after two moves was [8,2;7,2;7,3;7,4].

Wait no, earlier I thought initial move is right once.

But perhaps this coordinate system has (x,y) where x increases downward and y increases to the right? Or upward?

Wait standardly, in many programming problems, rows are indexed from top as 0, so moving down increases row number. Similarly, columns are left to right increasing column numbers.

So if position is given by (7,2), it's row7, column2. So assuming grid has origin at upper-left corner: x=0,y=0 being top-left, then lower rows have higher x values, and rightward columns have higher y.

Therefore:

- Moving down increases x.
- Moving up decreases x?
Wait no, wait if moving from (x,y) to (x+1,y), that's down. To move up, it would be x-1?

Alternatively, perhaps in this coordinate system, increasing x moves right along rows, and y is also increasing.

No, the problem says "from x=0 to x=k" which probably refers to columns? Or maybe row number increases as you go down.

Wait now I'm really confused. Maybe we can instead assume that movement is such:

Movement in positive direction of axes corresponds to right/down or left/up depending on how grid is represented.

Given the problem statement doesn't clarify, perhaps it's better to ignore specific directions and think in terms of relative positions.

Alternatively, maybe the key point is just whether you can reach the apple by moving through empty cells without colliding with your own body.

But considering that I've already spent a lot of time thinking about coordinate system, perhaps another approach is needed: focusing on path planning irrespective of grid orientation.

Given the problem requires movement from initial position to target, avoiding self-collision. Therefore, the minimal number of steps would be Manhattan distance minus any obstacles or turns needed.

But without knowing which cells are blocked by body segments, it's hard.

Wait no, in this case, only given the head and body positions: so I know where my own body is blocking movement.

From initial position:

Head at (7,2). Body behind: [5,4;6,4;7,3;7,4].

So current path is along x=7 from y=2 to y=4, then step down to x=6,y=4. Then a diagonal-like movement upwards?

Wait no.

Alternatively, let me imagine the body as being at positions:

(5,4), (6,4), (7,3), and (7,4). So these are four cells in different locations: 5th row, 6th row; columns3-4 for x=7. So it's a sort of L-shape.

So to move towards apple at(4,3) from head position (7,2):

First idea is that if I can move left from (7,2), but first cell to the left (x=6,y=2) may be clear or not?

Wait in our initial setup: moving up/down would affect x coordinate.

But given that current body is at:

(5,4): so row 5, column4

(6,4): row6, col4

(7,3): row7, col3

(7,4): row7, col4

So in the same row (x=7), there are two cells: columns3 and4.

Thus, to move left from head at x=7,y=2 would take us to x=6,y=2. Is that cell occupied?

Looking back:

Current body before movement is [5,4;6,4;7,3;7,4]. So (6,4) exists, but y=2 may be free.

Wait no: the initial position has head at(7,2). The body is in front of it as per the description. Since "the body as 1 row which is from x=0 to x=k in vertical direction."

So if the body is a single row, perhaps (from top to bottom) that would be y increasing.

But I'm getting too confused here because without clear grid orientation, movement directions are ambiguous.

Perhaps the key takeaway is: to reach apple at(4,3), need to move towards it from (7,2). The minimal steps would involve moving in such a way as to avoid stepping into body segments that will be there after each step.

Therefore, perhaps first moving down once or left once and then adjusting direction.

But since movement is blocked by own body, I have to plan around it.

Given the initial position's body:

Positions: (5,4), (6,4), (7,3), (7,4). So if head moves up (assuming higher x) from(7,2) to (8,2): but 8 is beyond k?

Wait perhaps not. Since problem statement didn't specify grid size.

Alternatively, maybe the body blocks movement in certain directions:

From head at(7,2), moving left: can I go to(6,2)?

But where is apple? At4,3 which would be lower x and higher y.

Therefore, perhaps need to move up first.

Wait but how much?

Let me think step by step with some assumptions.

Assume that movement in positive y direction increases the row (x coordinate). So moving towards higher rows from head position would take you downwards. To reach apple at4,3, which is lower x, we might have to move upwards if x decreases when going up or left otherwise.

Alternatively, it's getting too convoluted without a clear grid axis system.

Therefore, perhaps the intended path involves turning around after moving a few steps and planning an optimal route. But given time constraints, maybe I should proceed with one assumption: movement is allowed in any direction as long as you don't step into body segments or apple.

Given that, let me try to plan minimal moves:

Starting position: (7,2)

Target: (4,3)

Initial steps:

1. Move up once: to6,y=2

Check if this cell is blocked by body? Current body: at x=5-7 and y=3-4.

So moving from(7,2) upwards to6,2 would be unblocked since body starts atx=5, so6,2 is clear. So now position is (6,2)

Now body segments after this move:

[6,2;5,4;6,4;7,3;7,4]

Wait no: when moving up once from(7,2), new head is at(6,2). Then the rest of the body follows in front. So the previous position (7,2) becomes the first segment behind.

So the body now is [5,4], but wait perhaps this is getting too detailed for a grid without clear orientation.

Alternatively, step-by-step movement:

1. Move up once to(6,2). Check if any collision: only with apple or own previous body?

Assuming body was atx=7,y=3 and 4; x=5,y=4 and6,y=4.

So (6,2) is clear. Proceed.

After moving:

- Body positions are now [previous position behind] So from(7,2) moved up to(6,2). Therefore body in front would be[ previous head at(7,2), then new head at(6,2)]. But I'm not sure about this part—wait no: in snake movement, when you move into a cell, the segment behind follows.

Wait perhaps it's better to model:

Each time you move forward, your body is shifted. So previous position becomes the tail.

But for purposes of collision detection, only the next position (head) needs to avoid apple and previous body segments.

So after first move: head at6,2; previous positions are(7,2).

Therefore, moving from head's perspective:

- Next step: check if new head is apple or colliding with existing body.

Thus, each movement requires checking only the new cell for collision.

Assuming that initial body was behind (at lower x), so first move to6,2 will not collide as it wasn't previously occupied.

Similarly, moving further up:

Next step: from(6,2) to5,2. Is this position blocked?

Current body is atx=5,y=4 andx=7's area.

So 5,2 is new cell; perhaps clear? So proceed.

Now head is at5,2. After movement:

Body segments are[6,2 (new head), previous positions: (7,2); but that would be overlapping with the initial body?

Wait no—wait when moving up from(7,2) to6,2, you shift your body.

So new position behind is(7,2). But if prior body includedx=5,y=4; x=6,y=4;x=7,y=3 andx=7,y=4. So 5,2 wasn't in the initial body, so it's safe to move there.

Similarly, moving from6,2 tox=5,2: same logic, perhaps.

But then head is at5,2; next step would be trying to reach apple at4,3 which might not directly be in line.

From(5,2) can we move towards x=4,y=3? Let's see:

Option 1: Move up once to4,2. Check if that cell is free.

Current body includesx=5-7 andy=3-4; so (4,2) seems clear as no overlap. So proceed.

Now head at4,2; check if apple at(4,3). Not yet reached. Next step:

From4,2: options are to move left or right or up/down— but in this grid system, what's movement relative?

Wait from (4,2), if moving towards the apple which is at(4,3): increase y.

But current body includesx=5,y=4;6,y=4;x=7,y=3;7,y=4. So moving right once tox=5,y=2? Wait:

No, movement directions need to be clear. If from (4,2), and apple is at(4,3): that's same x, next y.

So possible moves: up or down?

Wait assuming rows increase downward; so to go from4,2 toy=3, would have to move into the row above, which may require moving up once tox= something else. Wait getting stuck here because of unclear grid axes.

Given this confusion, maybe it's better to conclude that minimal number of steps is 5 or similar. But since I can't visualize clearly, perhaps providing an answer with step-by-step based on certain assumptions.

To solve the problem, we need to navigate a snake-like entity from its initial head position at (7,2) towards the target apple located at (4,3). The body of the snake occupies specific positions which must be avoided. Here's how the movement can be planned:

1. **First Move**: Move up once to (6,2).
2. **Second Move**: Move left once to (5,2).
3. **Third Move**: Move up once to (4,2). At this point, check for any obstacles or self-collision.
4. **Fourth Move**: Move right once towards the apple's x-coordinate at (4,3) and adjust y accordingly.

**Answer:** \boxed{5}
