========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the snake can get from its current position at (5,0) to the apple at (9,0). Let me start by understanding the game state.

The head is at (5,0), and it's currently moving RIGHT. The body of the snake is a long line of cells stretching down from (4,6) all the way to (4,0). So the snake's body is in column 4, starting from row 6 down to row 0. That means the snake is taking up almost the entire left side of the grid, except for the head which is at (5,0).

The apple is at (9,0), which is on the same row as the head but all the way to the right edge. So, moving right from (5,0) would take the head towards the apple. But wait, the snake's body extends into column 4, so I need to make sure that when the head moves right, it doesn't collide with any part of its body.

Since the current direction is RIGHT, and according to movement rules, the snake cannot reverse direction immediately. So from RIGHT, the next move can be either UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again. It can't go LEFT because that's reversing direction.

So, moving directly right towards the apple seems like a good idea, but I need to check if there are any body cells in the way. The head is at (5,0), and the body starts at (4,6) down to (4,0). So when the snake moves right from (5,0) to (6,0), it's moving into a cell that isn't part of its current body because the body is in column 4. Therefore, this move should be safe.

But wait, let me visualize this. The grid is 10x10. The snake's head is at (5,0) facing right. The body goes from (4,6) down to (4,0). So the next cell after moving right is (6,0), which is clear because none of the body cells are in column 5 or beyond.

So the plan would be to move right four times: from (5,0) → (6,0) → (7,0) → (8,0) → (9,0). Each move adds a new segment to the snake's body because it's eating the apple when it reaches (9,0).

Wait, but after moving into (9,0), which is where the apple is, the snake grows by one segment. So the tail won't shrink on the next move. That means after eating the apple, the snake will have an extra body segment.

But before that, I need to make sure each step doesn't cause a collision with the body or go out of bounds. Since all moves are towards the right and none of those cells are part of the body, this path should be safe.

So the sequence would be:

1. RIGHT
2. RIGHT
3. RIGHT
4. RIGHT

That's four moves to reach (9,0). Let me check if the constraints are met. The direction is RIGHT each time, which doesn't reverse any prior move because all are in the same direction. Also, no collisions with body or walls.

I think that should work.
</think>

The snake can safely move right four times without colliding with its body and reach the apple at (9,0). 

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "The snake moves directly to the right four times to reach the apple. This path is safe as no body cells block the way."
}
```
