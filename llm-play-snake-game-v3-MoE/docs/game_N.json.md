## Question

What is the game_N.json file , what's the detailed schema? Is its entries ordered? What is toward the top and toward the bottom of the json file? What's the relationship between the entries?


As a fundamental rule, the schema of our `game_N.json` and `summary.json` files is now fixed and should never be modified. You can, on the contrary, modify the code to change how those values are calculated.



## Answer

# Understanding the game_N.json File Structure

The `game_N.json` files (where N is a sequential game number) are comprehensive records of individual snake game sessions played by an LLM. These files contain structured data about every aspect of a game, from basic statistics to detailed move-by-move breakdowns.

## Overall Purpose and Structure

Each `game_N.json` file serves as a complete record of a single game session, capturing all relevant metrics, decisions, and outcomes. The files follow a consistent, hierarchical schema that progresses from summary statistics at the top to increasingly detailed information toward the bottom.

## Top-Level Entries (Beginning of File)

The file begins with high-level summary statistics that provide a quick overview of the game's outcome:

```json
{
  "score": 1,                      // Number of apples eaten
  "steps": 15,                     // Total moves made
  "snake_length": 2,               // Final length of snake (initial length + score)
  "game_over": true,               // Whether the game has ended
  "game_end_reason": "SELF",       // Reason for game ending (SELF, WALL, MAX_STEPS, etc.)
  "round_count": 9,                // Number of LLM interaction rounds
  ...
}
```

These entries answer the fundamental questions: How well did the LLM perform? What was the final outcome? How did the game end?

## Mid-Level Entries

Following the summary statistics are several categories of more detailed metrics:

### Time Statistics
```json
"time_stats": {
  "start_time": "2025-06-11 15:40:02",
  "end_time": "2025-06-11 15:54:41",
  "total_duration_seconds": 879.49,
  "llm_communication_time": 879.45,
  "game_movement_time": 0.032,
  "waiting_time": 0.0,
  "other_time": 0.012,
  "llm_communication_percent": 99.99,
  ...
}
```

This section breaks down how time was spent during the game, revealing that the vast majority of time (typically >99%) is spent in LLM communication.

### LLM Information
```json
"llm_info": {
  "primary_provider": "ollama",
  "primary_model": "deepseek-r1:14b",
  "parser_provider": "ollama",
  "parser_model": "gemma2:9b"
}
```

This documents which models were used for the primary decision-making and for parsing responses.

### Response and Token Statistics
```json
"prompt_response_stats": {
  "avg_primary_response_time": 91.93,
  "min_primary_response_time": 18.02,
  "max_primary_response_time": 150.04,
  ...
},
"token_stats": {
  "primary": {
    "total_tokens": 48884,
    "total_prompt_tokens": 18414,
    "total_completion_tokens": 30470,
    ...
  },
  "secondary": {
    ...
  }
}
```

These sections track performance metrics like response times and token usage, which are crucial for understanding the computational resources consumed during the game.

### Game Play Statistics
```json
"step_stats": {
  "valid_steps": 15,
  "empty_steps": 0,
  "error_steps": 0,
  "invalid_reversals": 0,
  "max_consecutive_empty_moves_reached": 0
},
"error_stats": {
  "total_errors_from_primary_llm": 0,
  "total_errors_from_secondary_llm": 0,
  ...
},
"json_parsing_stats": {
  "total_extraction_attempts": 27,
  "successful_extractions": 9,
  "success_rate": 33.33,
  ...
}
```

These sections provide insights into the quality of the LLM's gameplay and response parsing, showing how often the model produced valid moves versus errors.

### Metadata
```json
"metadata": {
  "game_number": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-06-11 15:40:02",
  "last_move": "UP",
  "round_count": 9,
  "max_consecutive_empty_moves_allowed": 3,
  "max_consecutive_errors_allowed": 20,
}
```

This section contains configuration parameters and basic identification information for the game session.

## Detailed Statistics Arrays (Mid-File)

The file then includes arrays of per-round token statistics:

```json
"primary_token_stats": [
  {
    "prompt_tokens": 2028,
    "completion_tokens": 556,
    "total_tokens": 2584
  },
  ...
],
"secondary_token_stats": [
  ...
]
```

These arrays provide round-by-round token usage for both the primary and secondary (parser) LLMs.

## Detailed History (Bottom of File)

The most detailed information appears near the end of the file:

### Apple Positions
```json
"detailed_history": {
  "apple_positions": [
    {
      "x": 5,
      "y": 7
    },
    ...
  ],
```

This array records the coordinates of all apple positions that appeared during the game.

### Moves
```json
  "moves": [
    "UP",
    "UP",
    "RIGHT",
    ...
  ],
```

This chronological array contains every move made during the game, providing a complete replay of the snake's path.

### Round-by-Round Data
```json
  "rounds_data": {
    "round_1": {
      "apple_position": [5, 7],
      "moves": ["UP", "UP"],
      "primary_response_times": [18.02],
      "secondary_response_times": [4.00],
      "primary_token_stats": [...],
      "secondary_token_stats": [...],
      "invalid_reversals": []
    },
    "round_2": {
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

This highly detailed section contains a breakdown of each interaction round between the game and the LLM, including:
- The apple position at the start of the round
- All moves made during that round
- Response times for both LLMs
- Token statistics for that specific round
- Any invalid move attempts

## Are Entries Ordered?

Yes, the entries in the `game_N.json` file follow a deliberate and consistent order:

1. **Summary statistics** (score, steps, game_over, etc.) appear first to provide an immediate overview
2. **Detailed metrics** (time_stats, token_stats, step_stats) follow, organized by category
3. **Granular data arrays** (token_stats by round) appear in the middle
4. **Complete historical record** (apple positions, moves, round-by-round details) appears at the end

This organization follows a logical progression from summary to detail, allowing for both quick assessment of performance and deep analysis of specific aspects of gameplay.

## Relationships Between Entries

The entries in the `game_N.json` file are highly interrelated, forming a comprehensive picture of the game:

1. **Hierarchical Relationship**: The data is organized hierarchically, with summary statistics derived from the detailed data that appears later in the file. For example, the top-level `score` is equal to the number of apples eaten, which could be derived by counting the entries in the `apple_positions` array.

2. **Temporal Relationship**: The `moves` array and `rounds_data` section maintain a chronological record of the game, enabling precise replay and analysis of the game's progression over time.

3. **Performance Metrics Relationship**: Entries like `prompt_response_stats` aggregate data from the individual response times recorded in `rounds_data`, allowing for both summary statistics and per-round examination.

4. **Gameplay Quality Relationship**: The `step_stats` and `error_stats` provide insights into the quality of the LLM's gameplay decisions, which can be correlated with the token usage statistics to analyze the relationship between computational resources and performance.

5. **Configuration-Outcome Relationship**: The `metadata` section contains configuration parameters that influenced the game, providing context for interpreting the outcomes recorded in the summary statistics.

## Usage in the Codebase

The `game_N.json` files serve multiple purposes in the codebase:

1. **Game Continuation**: The `read_existing_game_data` function in `continuation_utils.py` reads these files to resume gameplay sessions, extracting key statistics to maintain continuity.

2. **Performance Analysis**: The comprehensive statistics enable detailed analysis of LLM performance across different games and models.

3. **Replay Capability**: The detailed move history and apple positions allow the game to be replayed exactly as it occurred.

4. **Debugging**: The granular data, especially in the `rounds_data` section, provides valuable information for debugging issues with LLM responses and game mechanics.

## File Size and Complexity

The `game_N.json` files vary in size based on the length and complexity of the game. Longer games with more rounds of LLM interaction will produce larger files. The examples show files ranging from ~200 lines (for a short game that ended quickly) to ~700 lines (for a longer game with multiple rounds).

The complexity and comprehensive nature of these files reflect the sophisticated instrumentation of the snake game environment, enabling detailed analysis and comparison of LLM gameplay performance.
