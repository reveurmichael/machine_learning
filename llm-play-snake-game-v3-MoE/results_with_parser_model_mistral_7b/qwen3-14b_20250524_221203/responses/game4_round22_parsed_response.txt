{"moves": ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "DOWN"], "reasoning": "The snake's head is initially at (1,4) and the body consists of two cells below it in the same column. The apple is located at (7,3). To avoid colliding with itself, the snake should move only to the right until reaching the apple column, then move down. In this case, the snake moves 6 times to the right (from x=1 to x=7) and once down (from y=4 to y=3), totaling 7 steps."}
