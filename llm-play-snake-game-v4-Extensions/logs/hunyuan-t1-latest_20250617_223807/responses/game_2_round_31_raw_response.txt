========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The head needs to move left 4 times to reach (0,7). Each left move is safe as the path is clear of body segments (initial body starts at (5,7), so left of head is empty). After eating the apple, moving up from (0,7) is a valid next move, avoiding trapping."
