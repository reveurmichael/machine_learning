========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the game state. The snake's head is at (1,8), and the apple is at (7,8). So the goal is to move right from x=1 to x=7 while keeping y=8 constant. That means the snake needs to make 6 moves to the right without any up or down movements.

The current direction is "UP", but according to the rules, I can't reverse direction immediately. Since "UP" and "DOWN" are opposites, my next move cannot be "DOWN". So from "UP", the allowed directions are "UP", "LEFT", or "RIGHT".

Looking at the body cells: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. These are directly below the head. Since the current direction is "UP", moving up would take the head to (1,9), which is outside the grid—so that's a collision and death.

So I can't move UP again because it would go out of bounds. Therefore, my first move must be either LEFT or RIGHT.

But wait, the apple is at x=7, so moving right makes sense. If I choose "RIGHT", the new head will be (2,8). Then, I need to check if this position collides with any body cells except possibly the tail.

The current body after the head is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. The new head (2,8) isn't in these positions, so it's safe. So moving RIGHT is okay.

After moving right, I need to update the body. Since we're not eating an apple yet, the tail will move. The old head (1,8) will be added to the front of the body, making it [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. Then, remove the tail (1,5), so the new body is [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)].

Next move: since we're moving right each time, I need to continue in that direction without reversing. Each step, as long as the next position is within bounds and not colliding with any part of the body except possibly the tail when it's about to move.

Let me plan each step:

1. Move RIGHT to (2,8)
2. Then RIGHT again to (3,8)
3. Continue this until reaching (7,8)

Wait, but after several moves, will the body get in the way? Let me think about how the body grows and shifts.

Each time we move right without eating an apple, the body follows: each segment moves into the position of the previous one, except when growing. So as long as I'm moving straight right, the body segments will follow, but they won't block my path because they are below me.

But let's simulate a few steps to see:

Starting head at (1,8), direction RIGHT.

Move 1: New head (2,8). Body becomes [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. Tail removed? No, wait—no apple yet, so tail is removed. So body after first move is [(1,8), (1,7)]?

Wait, no. Wait the initial body was [BODY1, BODY2, BODY3], which are (1,7), (1,6), (1,5). After moving right:

- New head is (2,8).
- Insert old head (1,8) into body: new body list is [(1,8)] + current body.

So the new body list becomes [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].
But since we didn't eat an apple, we remove the tail. So after removing (1,5), body is [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)].

Wait no, initial body is [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5)], which has 3 elements. After inserting old head at front, it's now length 4: [old_head, (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. Then, if not eating apple, we remove tail—so the body becomes [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)].

So next step:

Move 2: head at (2,8). Move right to (3,8).

Check collision: new head is (3,8). The current body after first move is [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. None of these are (3,8), so safe.

Insert old head (2,8) into body front: body becomes [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6)].

Since no apple eaten, remove tail: new body is [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)].

Wait, but the initial after first move was head at 2,8 and body [1,8; 1,7; 1,6]. Then in second move, we insert 2,8 as the new front of the body before moving. So the body after inserting is [ (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6) ]. But then we remove tail if not eating apple, so it becomes [ (2,8), (1,8), (1,7) ].

Hmm, this seems okay. Each step the body follows without blocking.

But wait, when I move right again, the head is at 3,8 and the body includes (2,8). So in the next move, the new head will be at 4,8. The body after inserting old head would be [3,8; 2,8; 1,8]. Then remove tail if not eating apple.

But what about when approaching the apple? Let's see.

The apple is at (7,8). So I need to move right six times from x=1. But each time I move, the body follows.

Wait, but after several moves, will the snake's body block its own path?

For example, after moving right multiple times, the body segments are arranged in a straight line behind the head. Since the movement is all to the right, the body won't interfere because they're on the same row but below (y=7,6,5 etc.).

So as long as I keep moving right without any up or down, the path is clear.

Another consideration: when I reach x=7, will there be enough space? The apple is at (7,8), which is within the grid. So moving to (7,8) would eat the apple.

Let me see:

After several moves, the head is at 6,8. Next move right takes it to 7,8—apple's position.

So upon eating the apple, the body grows by one segment. The body before eating was [ ... , ... ] but more importantly, after eating, the tail doesn't get removed.

But also, I need to ensure that after eating, there's at least one legal move left. So when I'm at 7,8 and eat the apple, what is my next possible direction?

The current direction before eating is right (I've been moving right all the time). After eating, the head is now at 7,8, and the body has grown.

But after eating, can I still move? The problem says that after eating, ensure there's at least one legal move next turn. So in this case, if I'm at (7,8) facing right, moving further right would take me to (8,8), which is within bounds. Alternatively, I could also move up or down as long as it doesn't hit the body.

Wait, but let's think: when the apple is eaten, we have to make sure that after adding a new segment, there are no immediate collisions if we continue moving in any direction except reverse.

In this case, after eating at (7,8), the next move could be right again (to 8,8) or up/down. So it's safe because all directions except left would keep me within the grid and not immediately collide with my body.

Therefore, the plan is to move right six times without any other direction changes. Each step is safe as the body follows behind and doesn't block the path.

So the sequence of moves should be ["RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "RIGHT"].

But wait, I need to make sure that each move after the first doesn't reverse direction. Since all moves are in the same direction (right), there's no issue with reversing.

Another check: the movement from (1,8) requires 6 rights to reach (7,8). So six moves of right is correct.

I think this should work.
