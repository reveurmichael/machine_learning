========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this snake get from its current position (7,4) to the apple at (8,4). The snake's head is at (7,4), and it's moving down. I need to plan a sequence of moves that gets the head all the way to the apple without hitting any walls or itself.

First, let me visualize this grid. The snake starts at position (7,4), which is in the middle of the bottom row since y=0 is the top and x increases to the right. Wait, noâ€”actually, according to the coordinate system, (x,y) where UP increases y by 1 and DOWN decreases it. So (7,4) is actually somewhere towards the left side but not all the way.

The apple is at (8,4), which is just one unit to the right of the snake's head. Since the snake can't reverse direction on its first move, moving RIGHT would be a good initial step because that's directly toward the apple.

But wait, I need to check if moving RIGHT next to the apple causes any issues. The snake's body currently is empty except for the head at (7,4). So moving RIGHT once would take the head to (8,4), which is where the apple is. But according to the rules, when the snake eats the apple, it grows by one segment because the tail doesn't shrink on the next move.

So if I move RIGHT now, the head moves to (8,4), and that's where the apple is. That should be fine because there are no other body parts in the way. But does moving RIGHT immediately count as a move? Yes, it would add "RIGHT" to the sequence of moves.

Wait, but let me think again about movement rules. The snake can't reverse direction on its first move. Since the initial direction is DOWN, moving RIGHT isn't reversing. So that's allowed.

After eating the apple, the snake grows by one segment, meaning the tail remains if it hasn't been eaten yet. But in this case, since we're eating the apple immediately with the next move, does the body get extended? Or do I need to consider whether moving RIGHT would cause the head and tail to be adjacent?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The snake's body is empty except for the head at (7,4). So when moving RIGHT once, the new position of the head becomes (8,4), which is where the apple is. Since there are no other body parts in between or around, this should be a safe move.

But I also need to make sure that after eating the apple, the snake doesn't get stuck. The problem statement says to avoid traps by ensuring at least one legal move exists afterward. So if moving RIGHT leads to (8,4), then after that, the snake's next moves have to consider not reversing direction again.

Wait, but in this case, since we're done once the head reaches (8,4) and eats the apple, do I need to keep moving? Or is just reaching the apple sufficient?

I think the problem requires a sequence of moves leading from the starting position all the way to eating the apple. So perhaps it's only one move: RIGHT.

But let me check the constraints again. The snake can't reverse direction on its first move, which in this case isn't an issue since moving RIGHT is allowed. Moving RIGHT will directly lead the head to (8,4), so that should be acceptable.

I think I'm overcomplicating it because maybe there's a body part blocking somewhere else? But according to the given inputs, the snake's body cells are empty, only the head position is given as (7,4). So no other parts of the body interfere. Thus, moving RIGHT once should be safe and direct.

Wait, but perhaps I need to make sure that after moving RIGHT, there isn't a direction change issue later on? Or maybe not because if we just reach the apple with one move, then it's done. The problem says "reach" the apple by making moves until the head is at (8,4), and in this case, it would be just one move.

So perhaps the answer is simply ["RIGHT"].

The snake can directly move RIGHT once to reach the apple without any intermediate steps or complications.

```json
{
  "moves": ["RIGHT"],
  "reasoning": "Moving right directly from (7,4) to (8,4), which is where the apple is located. The snake's current direction allows this move as it isn't reversing. There are no obstacles in this path."
}
```
