```json
{
  "moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "UP"],
  "reasoning": "The snake starts at (5,3) and the apple is at (5,9), which requires 5 vertical moves to reach. To avoid initial self-collision and immediate trapping, we move UP five times. The snake can't reverse direction on the first move, so we choose 'UP'. After moving up twice, there will be no cells to collide with until the last move."
