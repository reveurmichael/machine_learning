========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["UP", "UP", "UP", "UP", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The snake needs to move up 4 times (from y=0 to y=4) and left 4 times (from x=7 to x=3) to reach the apple at (3,4). Starting with UP avoids reversing the initial RIGHT direction and moves the head into empty space. Continuing UP clears the bottom row, then shifting LEFT avoids the snake's trailing body segments. Each move is checked for collisions, and after eating the apple, there are valid next moves (e.g., UP or LEFT) to avoid trapping."
