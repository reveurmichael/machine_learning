========== PRIMARY LLM RESPONSE (GAME STRATEGY) ==========

{
"moves": ["LEFT"],
"reasoning": "The head is at (9,9) and the apple is at (8,9), which is directly to the left. The current direction is UP, so moving LEFT is allowed (not reversing). The new head position (8,9) is within bounds and not occupied by any body segments (current body is along x=9, y=3-8). Moving LEFT reaches the apple in one step, and since the snake will grow (no tail removal), there will be space to move next turn."
